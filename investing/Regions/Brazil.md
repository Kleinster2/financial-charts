## Monetary policy history

Brazil is a case study in [[Time consistency]] — both violations and successful reforms. See [[Banco Central do Brasil]] for full institutional detail.

| Era | Policy | Outcome |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **1980-1994** | CB financed deficits, no independence | Hyperinflation (3,000%/year), six failed stabilization plans |
| **1994 Plano Real** | Fiscal reform + credible currency | Inflation: 90%/month → single digits |
| **2003-2011 Lula I/II** | Maintained post-Real consensus | Credibility preserved despite leftist president |
| **2011-2016 Dilma** | Replaced CB board, "New Economic Matrix" | Inflation doubled (5.9% → 10.7%), impeachment |
| **2021** | Formal CB independence law (Bolsonaro) | Fixed terms, can't fire governor at will |
| **2023-2024 Lula III** | Attacked CB, called independence "nonsense" | CB held firm under Campos Neto |
| **2025 Galípolo** | Lula's pick takes over Jan 1, 2025 | **Most aggressive hiking cycle in years** — Selic 10.75% → 15% |

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Gabriel Galípolo — Lula's own pick — turned out to be a credible inflation hawk. In 2025, he raised the Selic by 450bp (10.75% → 15%) and held at 15% since July despite Lula's pressure. Inflation at 5.53% (vs 3% target) but expectations anchoring. Galípolo: high rates needed "for extended period." **K-P vindicated** — the 2021 independence law worked; even Lula's appointee prioritizes credibility over politics.
