# Arctic

Emerging strategic region as climate change opens shipping routes and resources. Contested between Russia, NATO, and China.

## Why it matters

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Shipping** | New Asia-Europe routes bypassing Suez |
| **Resources** | 13% of undiscovered oil, 30% of undiscovered gas |
| **Military** | Submarine routes, early warning, strategic depth |
| **Climate** | Fastest-warming region on Earth |

## Shipping routes

| Route | Controller | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| [[Northern Sea Route]] | Russia | Operational (seasonal) |
| [[Northwest Passage]] | Canada (disputed) | Not commercially viable yet |
| Transpolar Sea Route | International | Future (ice dependent) |

**Distance savings (Shanghai → Rotterdam):**
- Suez: ~21,000 km (35-45 days)
- Northern Sea Route: ~15,000 km (25 days)

See [[Northern Sea Route]], [[Northwest Passage]] for details.

## Military presence (IISS 2026)

### Base count (from IISS map)

| Side | Bases | Distribution |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Russia** | ~25+ | Entire northern coast, dense coverage |
| **NATO** | ~15 | Clustered: Alaska, Greenland, Norway/Finland |

**Asymmetry:** Russia can monitor/control full Northern Sea Route. NATO has gaps.

### NATO positions
- **US/Canada:** Alaska, Canadian Arctic
- **[[Greenland]]:** Pituffik Space Base — early warning, missile defense
- **Norway:** Northern bases
- **Iceland:** [[GIUK Gap]] control, mid-Atlantic
- **Finland:** New NATO member (2023) — bases near Russian border

### Russia positions
- **Northern Fleet:** Murmansk area, nuclear submarines
- **Base network:** Spans entire Arctic coast
- **Icebreaker fleet:** World's largest (including nuclear)
- **Reopening:** Soviet-era Arctic installations

### Finland-Russia border

**Flashpoint potential:** Cluster of both NATO and Russian bases in close proximity (visible on IISS map).

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Finland NATO accession (2023) | 1,340 km new NATO-Russia border |
| Base proximity | Direct confrontation risk |
| Barents Sea | Contested waters |
| Sweden NATO (2024) | Baltic-Arctic linkage |

### Strategic gaps

| Location | Status | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Svalbard]] | Demilitarized (1920 treaty) | Norway can't base military |
| Central Arctic | No bases | Open water competition |
| [[GIUK Gap]] | NATO controlled | Submarine chokepoint |

**Balance:** Russia has geographic advantage — longest coastline, established infrastructure. NATO relies on Greenland, Norway, and now Finland for access.

## Key territories

| Territory | Sovereignty | Strategic value |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [[Greenland]] | Denmark (autonomous) | Controls Northwest Passage access, US base, rare earths |
| [[Svalbard]] | Norway | Demilitarized by treaty, research stations, strategic gap |
| Franz Josef Land | Russia | Military outposts |
| Canadian Archipelago | Canada | Northwest Passage islands |

---

## China's Arctic strategy

**"Near-Arctic state"** — China claims polar interests despite no Arctic territory.

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Arctic Council observer | Since 2013 |
| Polar Silk Road | Part of Belt & Road (2018) |
| [[Yamal LNG]] stake | 30% via CNPC/Silk Road Fund |
| Icebreaker fleet | Growing, nuclear design planned |
| Research stations | Svalbard, Iceland |

**Approach:** Partner with Russia for Northern Sea Route access rather than challenge sovereignty.

---

## Resources

| Resource | Arctic share | Key players |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Undiscovered oil | ~13% global | Russia, US (Alaska), Norway |
| Undiscovered gas | ~30% global | Russia ([[Yamal LNG]], [[Novatek]]) |
| Rare earths | Significant | [[Greenland]] deposits |
| Fisheries | Growing | Russia, Norway |

Climate change opening previously inaccessible areas.

---

## Climate dynamics

| Metric | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| Summer ice (1980s) | ~6.5M sq km |
| Summer ice (recent) | ~4M sq km |
| Change | **-40%** |
| Warming rate | 2-3x global average |

**Implications:**
- Longer shipping seasons
- New resource access
- Permafrost thaw (infrastructure risk)
- Sovereignty disputes heating up

---

## Investment angles

| Theme | Vehicles |
|-------|----------|
| Arctic shipping | [[COSCO]], ice-class shipbuilders |
| Arctic LNG | [[Novatek]], [[Yamal LNG]] (if investable) |
| Rare earths | Greenland miners (if developed) |
| Defense | Shipbuilders, surveillance tech |

**Watch for:**
- Northern Sea Route traffic volumes
- Greenland rare earth development
- Russia-China Arctic cooperation
- US Arctic policy shifts
