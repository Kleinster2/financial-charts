## Horn of Africa Risk (February 2026)

Ethiopia-Eritrea tensions at highest level since 2020-2022 Tigray War. ICG warns conflict "could erupt at any time." Key investment implications:

- **GERD dam**: Africa's largest hydroelectric project. Will double Ethiopia's power generation capacity. Drives existential dispute with Egypt over Nile water rights. If resolved, transformative for Ethiopian economic development and regional power trade.
- **Red Sea/Suez**: Potential state-on-state war at Bab el-Mandeb would compound Houthi shipping disruption. Egypt's Suez revenue (~$9B/year) further at risk.
- **DP World**: 65% stake in Berbera port (Somaliland) caught in UAE-Somalia diplomatic rupture.
- **Gulf capital flows**: UAE-Ethiopia investment axis vs Saudi-Egypt-Somalia counter-alignment.
