### AI & Defense

**[[Anthropic]] clashing with Pentagon over military AI** — After weeks of negotiation, Anthropic and DoD are at a standstill over a $200M contract. Anthropic refuses to remove safeguards blocking autonomous weapons targeting and domestic surveillance. Defense Secretary [[Pete Hegseth]] criticized Anthropic Jan 16 when adding [[xAI]]'s Grok to Pentagon providers, railing against AI that "won't allow you to fight wars." [[Dario Amodei]] countered that AI should support defense "in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries." First major test of whether AI labs can impose ethical constraints on military use. *(Semafor, Reuters)*
