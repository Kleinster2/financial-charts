## EU "Made in Europe" Industrial Accelerator Act

Reuters published an explainer on the [[EU]]'s draft **[[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026|Industrial Accelerator Act]]**, due Feb 26. Key details:

- Ties €2T+ in public procurement to **local content requirements** across batteries, solar, wind, EVs, hydrogen, nuclear, steel, aluminium
- EVs need EU assembly + 70% component value; solar panels need EU-made inverter + key components
- Foreign investments >€100M in sectors where investor's country dominates (≥40% global capacity) face **majority stake ban + forced IP licensing** — targeting [[China]]
- "Made in Europe" = EEA, with "trusted partners" (UK, Japan) addable later
- [[France]] (Séjourné) is the architect; [[Germany]] (Merz) wants softer "made *with* Europe"; Sweden/Czech Republic skeptical
- 1,100+ business leaders support it; carmakers notably absent
- Already delayed twice; Parliament + Council negotiations could take through 2027

Created: [[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026]]
