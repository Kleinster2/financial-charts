## EU "Made in Europe" Industrial Accelerator Act

Reuters published an explainer on the [[EU]]'s draft **[[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026|Industrial Accelerator Act]]**, due Feb 26. Key details:

- Ties â‚¬2T+ in public procurement to **local content requirements** across batteries, solar, wind, EVs, hydrogen, nuclear, steel, aluminium
- EVs need EU assembly + 70% component value; solar panels need EU-made inverter + key components
- Foreign investments >â‚¬100M in sectors where investor's country dominates (â‰¥40% global capacity) face **majority stake ban + forced IP licensing** â€” targeting [[China]]
- "Made in Europe" = EEA, with "trusted partners" (UK, Japan) addable later
- [[France]] (SÃ©journÃ©) is the architect; [[Germany]] (Merz) wants softer "made *with* Europe"; Sweden/Czech Republic skeptical
- 1,100+ business leaders support it; carmakers notably absent
- Already delayed twice; Parliament + Council negotiations could take through 2027

Created: [[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026]]

## Vault maintenance

## Claude Sonnet 4.6 launch

[[Anthropic]] released [[Claude|Claude Sonnet 4.6]] â€” second major model launch in under two weeks (after [[Claude|Opus 4.6]] on Feb 5). Brings frontier-class reasoning to Free and Pro users at Sonnet pricing ($3/$15 per MTok, unchanged). In [[Claude Code]] testing, users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 ~70% of the time â€” and over Opus 4.5 59% of the time. Key gains: 72.5% OSWorld (computer use), 77% complex reasoning (+15 pts), 1M token context (beta). Less over-engineering, fewer hallucinations, better instruction following.

Also announced: **Claude Cowork desktop app** (macOS native, Windows coming) â€” controls mouse/keyboard/browser for multi-step local tasks. Extends [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Cowork]] from cloud to desktop.

Context: Anthropic closed its $30B [[Anthropic|Series G]] at $380B valuation just 5 days ago. Revenue run rate at $14B. This pace of releases (Opus 4.6 â†’ Sonnet 4.6 in 12 days) signals aggressive model cadence.

Updated: [[Claude]] (Products), [[Anthropic]] (Actors)

## Meta-NVIDIA multiyear chip deal

[[Meta]] signed multiyear pact to deploy "millions" of [[NVIDIA]] processors â€” current Blackwell, next-gen Vera Rubin AI accelerators, and Grace/Vera CPUs plus networking gear. Key details:

- **First standalone Grace CPU deployment** â€” Meta becomes first major DC operator to use NVIDIA's Arm-based Grace CPUs in standalone servers (not paired with GPU accelerators), encroaching on [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] CPU markets
- Grace CPU handles backend workloads (databases, data manipulation, ML) at claimed 2x performance/watt vs x86 incumbents
- No dollar figure or timeline disclosed â€” NVIDIA's Ian Buck: deal reflects Meta's commitment across current and future product lines
- Zuckerberg: expanding partnership to "deliver personal superintelligence to everyone in the world"
- Meta accounts for ~9% of NVIDIA revenue (~$13B annualized)
- Context: Meta also developing in-house MTIA chips and in discussions with [[Google]] about TPU usage â€” NVIDIA retaining dominant share despite alternatives
- [[AMD]] fell >3% on the news; NVIDIA and Meta both rose >1% after-hours

**Thesis implications:**
- [[Long NVIDIA]]: validates demand durability ahead of Feb 25 earnings. Grace CPU standalone deployment opens new TAM beyond AI accelerators
- [[Long TSMC]]: all NVIDIA chips (Blackwell, Vera Rubin, Grace) manufactured at [[TSMC]]
- [[NVIDIA alternatives]]: despite Meta exploring TPUs and in-house chips, NVIDIA's full-stack (GPU + CPU + networking + software) locks in hyperscaler loyalty

## MGX deep dive â€” $100B AI bet

Bloomberg published first in-depth interview with [[MGX]] executives Ali Osman (AI investment chief) and David Scott (chief strategy & safety officer), conducted at Davos:

- Plans to deploy up to $10B/year on select companies over the next few years â€” staggering for a standalone fund
- Portfolio of ~20 firms. ~30 staff (~1/3 in NYC). Structured like VC/buyout (carried interest) â€” not a typical sovereign allocator
- Osman forecasts generative AI will grow to a $700B market within 5 years
- Entered [[Anthropic]] at $17B valuation â€” now $380B (Series G co-lead). [[Databricks]] doubled to $134B since entry
- Backs all three top AI labs ([[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[xAI]]) â€” sees them serving different markets (consumer / enterprise / robotics). "The TAM is so significant that the next net dollar gained is not at the expense of someone else"
- Assembling $30B AI infrastructure consortium. Also invested in [[Altera]] (chipmaker, via [[Silver Lake]])
- Explicitly avoids: AI consumer apps, neo-clouds, robotics, quantum, energy providers
- Strategy: invest across the "entire stack" (chips â†’ DCs â†’ models) to see demand signals across layers. Compares approach to [[NVIDIA]]
- Chairman [[Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] met Trump last year, helped tee up $1.4T UAE spending pledge in US (aided chip access pitch)
- Also: $2B Binance stake purchased via World Liberty stablecoin tied to Trump family; investor in US [[TikTok]] entity

## Moonshot AI targeting $10B valuation

[[Moonshot AI]] expanding its latest funding round, targeting $10B â€” more than double the $4.3B Series C closed in January:

- Existing backers [[Alibaba]], [[Tencent]], 5Y Capital committed >$700M to first tranche
- At $10B still undershoots rivals: [[Zhipu]] and [[MiniMax]] both >$29B after Hong Kong IPOs (raised >$1B combined)
- Kimi K2.5 ranked #2 open-source model on Artificial Analysis (behind Zhipu's GLM-5); among most-used LLMs on OpenRouter, ahead of [[DeepSeek]] and [[Google]] Gemini
- Launched OpenClaw cloud agent service for paid users
- [[Yang Zhilin]] wrote internal memo (Dec 2025): no rush for IPO, 10B yuan ($1.4B) cash on hand
- Paying users (China + overseas) grew 170% MoM during Sep-Nov 2025

Context: Moonshot trails Zhipu and MiniMax in commercialization. Both rivals went public in HK this year. But strong model performance (K2.5) and open-source strategy keep investor interest high.

## JAB Holding deep dive

Expanded [[JAB Holding]] from stub (~27 lines) to comprehensive actor note (~335 lines). Key content:

- Full ownership structure: [[Reimann]] family (~95% via Agnaten SE), four heirs (Matthias Reimann-Andersen, Renate Reimann-Haas, Stefan Reimann-Andersen, Wolfgang Reimann)
- Complete acquisition timeline: $50B spree from 2012 coffee entry ([[Peet's Coffee]] $974M) through [[Keurig Green Mountain]] ($13.9B), [[Panera Bread]] ($7.5B), to [[Dr Pepper Snapple]] merger ($18.7B)
- Leadership transition: [[Peter Harf]] retired Apr 2025 after 40+ years; [[Joachim Creus]] and [[Frank Engelen]] now co-CEOs; [[Olivier Goudet]] departed as CEO Nov 2023
- Strategic pivot: exiting coffee (KDP acquiring [[JDE Peet's]] for EUR15.7B / $18.4B, Aug 2025); building global insurance platform (acquired [[Prosperity Life Group]] ~$30B AUM from [[Elliott Management]], Sep 2025)
- Financial profile: ~$52B group portfolio, ~$10.6B gross debt, Moody's Baa1 / S&P BBB (downgraded Mar 2025), $10.1B net loss in 2024 (mark-to-market)
- Pet care empire: [[National Veterinary Associates]] (~1,400 locations, $6B revenue), [[Independence Pet Holdings]] (20+ brands, 5M+ pets), FTC consent order and congressional scrutiny
- Controversies: Reimann family Nazi-era history (2019), [[Alfred Landecker Foundation]] (EUR250M commitment)
- Current portfolio: [[Coty]] (~52%), [[Krispy Kreme]] (majority), [[Panera Brands]], [[Pret A Manger]], [[Espresso House]], NVA/Ethos, IPH, Prosperity Life

Created stubs: [[Reimann]], [[Peter Harf]], [[Keurig Dr Pepper]], [[JDE Peet's]], [[Krispy Kreme]], [[Panera Brands]], [[3G Capital]], [[Reckitt Benckiser]]

## Irving Farm Coffee deep dive

Created [[Irving Farm Coffee]] (Actors) â€” NYC specialty coffee roaster founded 1996 by David Elwell and Steve Leven. ~$12-15M estimated revenue, ~56 employees, 6 cafe locations (down from ~8 peak after 2 closures in 2024-25). Roasts at Millerton, NY (Hudson Valley). CEO Chad Freilino since 2020. 75% direct-trade sourced. Bootstrapped, no external funding â€” one of few independent [[Third Wave coffee]] companies left as peers got acquired ([[Blue Bottle Coffee|Blue Bottle]] â†’ [[Nestle]], [[Intelligentsia Coffee|Intelligentsia]]/[[Stumptown Coffee|Stumptown]] â†’ [[JDE Peet's|Peet's]]/[[JAB Holding]]).

Created stubs: [[Third Wave coffee]] (Concept), [[Mast Brothers]], [[Stumptown Coffee]], [[Blue Bottle Coffee]], [[La Colombe]], [[Intelligentsia Coffee]], [[Joe Coffee]], [[Devocion]] (Actors). Added aliases to [[Keurig Dr Pepper]] (Green Mountain Coffee) and [[JDE Peet's]] (Peet's Coffee).
