## EU "Made in Europe" Industrial Accelerator Act

Reuters published an explainer on the [[EU]]'s draft **[[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026|Industrial Accelerator Act]]**, due Feb 26. Key details:

- Ties €2T+ in public procurement to **local content requirements** across batteries, solar, wind, EVs, hydrogen, nuclear, steel, aluminium
- EVs need EU assembly + 70% component value; solar panels need EU-made inverter + key components
- Foreign investments >€100M in sectors where investor's country dominates (≥40% global capacity) face **majority stake ban + forced IP licensing** — targeting [[China]]
- "Made in Europe" = EEA, with "trusted partners" (UK, Japan) addable later
- [[France]] (Séjourné) is the architect; [[Germany]] (Merz) wants softer "made *with* Europe"; Sweden/Czech Republic skeptical
- 1,100+ business leaders support it; carmakers notably absent
- Already delayed twice; Parliament + Council negotiations could take through 2027

Created: [[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026]]

## Vault maintenance

- Added `[[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026]]` links to: [[ASML]], [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]], [[NXP]], [[EU Chips Act]]
- Consolidated duplicate STMicro notes: deleted `STMicroelectronics.md` (stub, 26 lines) — `STMicro.md` (213 lines) already has `STMicroelectronics` as alias, so all `[[STMicroelectronics]]` links resolve correctly
- Added [[Macronix]] link from stub into comprehensive STMicro.md
- Added [[EU Chips Act]] link to NXP (was missing)

## Notes created/expanded

- Created [[Pre-IPO tutoring]] (Concepts) — mandatory Chinese regulatory process (辅导) where securities firm prepares company for listing; typical 6-12 months; speed signals government support; tutoring institution almost always becomes lead underwriter
- Updated [[Unitree]] (Actors) — wikilinked [[Pre-IPO tutoring]] and [[STAR Market]] in investment case and Related sections
