## EU "Made in Europe" Industrial Accelerator Act

Reuters published an explainer on the [[EU]]'s draft **[[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026|Industrial Accelerator Act]]**, due Feb 26. Key details:

- Ties €2T+ in public procurement to **local content requirements** across batteries, solar, wind, EVs, hydrogen, nuclear, steel, aluminium
- EVs need EU assembly + 70% component value; solar panels need EU-made inverter + key components
- Foreign investments >€100M in sectors where investor's country dominates (≥40% global capacity) face **majority stake ban + forced IP licensing** — targeting [[China]]
- "Made in Europe" = EEA, with "trusted partners" (UK, Japan) addable later
- [[France]] (Séjourné) is the architect; [[Germany]] (Merz) wants softer "made *with* Europe"; Sweden/Czech Republic skeptical
- 1,100+ business leaders support it; carmakers notably absent
- Already delayed twice; Parliament + Council negotiations could take through 2027

Created: [[EU Made in Europe Tech Rules 2026]]

## Claude Sonnet 4.6 launch

[[Anthropic]] released [[Claude|Claude Sonnet 4.6]] — second major model launch in under two weeks (after [[Claude|Opus 4.6]] on Feb 5). Brings frontier-class reasoning to Free and Pro users at Sonnet pricing ($3/$15 per MTok, unchanged). In [[Claude Code]] testing, users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 ~70% of the time — and over Opus 4.5 59% of the time. Key gains: 72.5% OSWorld (computer use), 77% complex reasoning (+15 pts), 1M token context (beta). Less over-engineering, fewer hallucinations, better instruction following.

Also announced: **Claude Cowork desktop app** (macOS native, Windows coming) — controls mouse/keyboard/browser for multi-step local tasks. Extends [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Cowork]] from cloud to desktop.

Context: Anthropic closed its $30B [[Anthropic|Series G]] at $380B valuation just 5 days ago. Revenue run rate at $14B. This pace of releases (Opus 4.6 → Sonnet 4.6 in 12 days) signals aggressive model cadence.

Updated: [[Claude]] (Products), [[Anthropic]] (Actors)

## Meta-NVIDIA multiyear chip deal

[[Meta]] signed multiyear pact to deploy "millions" of [[NVIDIA]] processors — current Blackwell, next-gen Vera Rubin AI accelerators, and Grace/Vera CPUs plus networking gear. Key details:

- **First standalone Grace CPU deployment** — Meta becomes first major DC operator to use NVIDIA's Arm-based Grace CPUs in standalone servers (not paired with GPU accelerators), encroaching on [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] CPU markets
- Grace CPU handles backend workloads (databases, data manipulation, ML) at claimed 2x performance/watt vs x86 incumbents
- No dollar figure or timeline disclosed — NVIDIA's Ian Buck: deal reflects Meta's commitment across current and future product lines
- Zuckerberg: expanding partnership to "deliver personal superintelligence to everyone in the world"
- Meta accounts for ~9% of NVIDIA revenue (~$13B annualized)
- Context: Meta also developing in-house MTIA chips and in discussions with [[Google]] about TPU usage — NVIDIA retaining dominant share despite alternatives
- [[AMD]] fell >3% on the news; NVIDIA and Meta both rose >1% after-hours

**Thesis implications:**
- [[Long NVIDIA]]: validates demand durability ahead of Feb 25 earnings. Grace CPU standalone deployment opens new TAM beyond AI accelerators
- [[Long TSMC]]: all NVIDIA chips (Blackwell, Vera Rubin, Grace) manufactured at [[TSMC]]
- [[NVIDIA alternatives]]: despite Meta exploring TPUs and in-house chips, NVIDIA's full-stack (GPU + CPU + networking + software) locks in hyperscaler loyalty

## MGX deep dive — $100B AI bet

Bloomberg published first in-depth interview with [[MGX]] executives Ali Osman (AI investment chief) and David Scott (chief strategy & safety officer), conducted at Davos:

- Plans to deploy up to $10B/year on select companies over the next few years — staggering for a standalone fund
- Portfolio of ~20 firms. ~30 staff (~1/3 in NYC). Structured like VC/buyout (carried interest) — not a typical sovereign allocator
- Osman forecasts generative AI will grow to a $700B market within 5 years
- Entered [[Anthropic]] at $17B valuation — now $380B (Series G co-lead). [[Databricks]] doubled to $134B since entry
- Backs all three top AI labs ([[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[xAI]]) — sees them serving different markets (consumer / enterprise / robotics). "The TAM is so significant that the next net dollar gained is not at the expense of someone else"
- Assembling $30B AI infrastructure consortium. Also invested in [[Altera]] (chipmaker, via [[Silver Lake]])
- Explicitly avoids: AI consumer apps, neo-clouds, robotics, quantum, energy providers
- Strategy: invest across the "entire stack" (chips → DCs → models) to see demand signals across layers. Compares approach to [[NVIDIA]]
- Chairman [[Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] met Trump last year, helped tee up $1.4T UAE spending pledge in US (aided chip access pitch)
- Also: $2B Binance stake purchased via World Liberty stablecoin tied to Trump family; investor in US [[TikTok]] entity

## Moonshot AI targeting $10B valuation

[[Moonshot AI]] expanding its latest funding round, targeting $10B — more than double the $4.3B Series C closed in January:

- Existing backers [[Alibaba]], [[Tencent]], 5Y Capital committed >$700M to first tranche
- At $10B still undershoots rivals: [[Zhipu]] and [[MiniMax]] both >$29B after Hong Kong IPOs (raised >$1B combined)
- Kimi K2.5 ranked #2 open-source model on Artificial Analysis (behind Zhipu's GLM-5); among most-used LLMs on OpenRouter, ahead of [[DeepSeek]] and [[Google]] Gemini
- Launched OpenClaw cloud agent service for paid users
- [[Yang Zhilin]] wrote internal memo (Dec 2025): no rush for IPO, 10B yuan ($1.4B) cash on hand
- Paying users (China + overseas) grew 170% MoM during Sep-Nov 2025

Context: Moonshot trails Zhipu and MiniMax in commercialization. Both rivals went public in HK this year. But strong model performance (K2.5) and open-source strategy keep investor interest high.

## Palliser activist stake in Toto — hidden AI ceramics play

[[Palliser Capital]] (UK activist) took a stake in [[Toto]] (5332.T), the Japanese toilet maker, and is pushing for disclosure of its advanced ceramics segment:

- Toto's ceramics division makes electrostatic chucks for cryogenic etching in [[3D NAND]] manufacturing — provides ~40-50% of operating profit
- [[Palliser Capital]]: top 20 shareholder (invested ~6 months ago). Calls Toto "the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary"
- Thesis: ¥554B ($3.6B) valuation disconnect. 55%+ upside from disclosure + capital allocation reform
- Estimates 5-year sustainable competitive advantage before rivals catch up
- Projects 30%+ revenue growth over two years from memory chip upgrade cycle
- [[Goldman Sachs]] upgraded to "buy" last month citing AI data center demand
- Stock +39% YTD, +4.3% on disclosure day
- Net cash: JPY76B (~$496M)
- Comparable: [[Ajinomoto]] makes ABF substrate insulation from umami resin expertise — another Japanese non-tech company in the semiconductor supply chain

**Thesis implications:**
- [[Long memory]]: Toto is an oblique play on 3D NAND layering trend — as [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]] add layers, cryogenic etching demand grows
- [[Japan]] corporate governance reform: activist wave continues to unlock hidden value in conglomerates

## SpaceX and xAI in Pentagon autonomous drone swarm contest

[[SpaceX]] and subsidiary [[xAI]] are among a handful of companies selected for a $100M Pentagon prize challenge to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming technology:

- 6-month contest launched Jan 2026 by Defense Innovation Unit + Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG, part of US Special Operations Command)
- SpaceX/xAI working on the entire project together — software to coordinate drone swarms across air and sea domains, from software development through live testing to "launch to termination"
- [[OpenAI]] supporting a separate bid from [[Applied Intuition]], limited to voice-to-digital "mission control" translation only (no drone operation or targeting)
- xAI hiring engineers with "secret"/"top secret" clearances; already has $200M Pentagon contract for [[Grok]] military integration
- Continues work from Biden-era Replicator initiative (expendable autonomous drones)
- Controversial: Musk previously signed 2015 open letter against offensive autonomous weapons. Defense officials concerned about generative AI (prone to hallucinations) in weapons platforms

**Thesis implications:**
- [[AI capex arms race]]: AI labs increasingly competing for defense revenue to fund model development
- SpaceX IPO narrative: defense AI adds to the SpaceX-xAI combined value story beyond rockets and satellites

## Powerlaw Corp filing to list on Nasdaq (PWRL)

[[Powerlaw Corp]] (PWRL) filing to list on [[Nasdaq]], giving retail investors access to top private AI/defense/space companies:

- Closed-end fund with >$1.2B AUM, ~$355M invested (at cost) across 18 private companies
- Top holdings at cost: [[OpenAI]] ($114.4M), [[SpaceX]] ($39.8M), [[xAI]] ($10.9M), plus [[Anthropic]] and [[Anduril]]
- Part of [[Akkadian Ventures]] platform (SF-based, specializes in buying secondary shares from existing backers)
- Listing 43.2M shares for resale by existing stockholders — not a traditional underwritten IPO
- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company as financial advisor; needs SEC approval
- 99% of investments provide exposure to private technology companies
- Converted from Delaware LLC to Maryland corporation (Sep 2025)

**Why it matters:** Retail investors have been largely shut out of the AI private company boom. [[OpenAI]] discussing fundraising at up to $830B valuation, [[SpaceX]]/[[xAI]] at $1.25T, [[Anthropic]] at $380B — all private. PWRL would be one of the first pure-play listed vehicles for individual investors.

Roasts at Millerton, NY (Hudson Valley). CEO Chad Freilino since 2020. 75% direct-trade sourced. Bootstrapped, no external funding — one of few independent [[Third Wave coffee]] companies left as peers got acquired ([[Blue Bottle Coffee|Blue Bottle]] → [[Nestle]], [[Intelligentsia Coffee|Intelligentsia]]/[[Stumptown Coffee|Stumptown]] → [[JDE Peet's|Peet's]]/[[JAB Holding]]).

Created stubs: [[Third Wave coffee]] (Concept), [[Mast Brothers]], [[Stumptown Coffee]], [[Blue Bottle Coffee]], [[La Colombe]], [[Intelligentsia Coffee]], [[Joe Coffee]], [[Devocion]] (Actors). Added aliases to [[Keurig Dr Pepper]] (Green Mountain Coffee) and [[JDE Peet's]] (Peet's Coffee).

## Lex Fridman Podcast #491 transcript deep dive

## Aeroderivative turbines for data centers

WSJ (Jinjoo Lee) on retired jet engines being converted to natural gas turbines for DC power. Incumbent turbine makers ([[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]], [[Mitsubishi]]) have years-long backlogs and are deliberately constraining capacity. Startups filling the gap:

- [[FTAI Aviation]] (FTAI): converting CFM56 (737 engine), ~100 turbines/year = 2.5 GW, stock +42%, Jefferies: $750M EBITDA/year potential
- [[Boom Supersonic]]: converting proprietary engine, first customer [[Crusoe Energy]], turbines 2027, goal 4 GW/year by 2030
- ProEnergy: gas turbines from 747 engines

Scale: 1,600 engines retired/year; if 1/3 converted → 13 GW (~25% of existing capacity). $700B+ hyperscaler capex driving urgency.
