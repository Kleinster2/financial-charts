## Key themes

### Sector rotation

Mag 7 underperforming S&P 493 since Oct 29. "AI fatigue" (Yardeni). Goldman sees Mag 7 EPS contribution falling 50% → 46%.

See [[Sector rotation]]

### Credit markets

Record issuance but some going defensive. RBA at zero corporate credit — "everything bubble" warning.

See [[Credit markets]], [[Risk on risk off]]
