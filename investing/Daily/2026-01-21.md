## Fed independence: Supreme Court skeptical

The [[Fed independence]] saga reached the Supreme Court today. At least 6 justices — including Trump appointees Kavanaugh and Barrett — questioned the administration's attempt to fire Fed Governor [[Lisa Cook]].

Key moments:
- [[Jerome Powell]] and Ben Bernanke watched from gallery
- Kavanaugh warned: "what goes around, comes around" — future presidents could fire appointees at will
- Cook's alleged mortgage fraud (dual primary residences in 2021) — NBC obtained documents appearing to contradict the claim
- No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in 112 years

Cook's statement: "This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure."

Outcome: Court appears likely to block the firing, at least temporarily.

## PJM BYOG proposal (Jan 17-19)

PJM proposes "Bring Your Own Generation" — shot across bow of incumbent power generators:

| Proposal | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Expedited interconnection | Only for *new* capacity that offsets large loads |
| Curtailment | New large loads without matching generation can be switched off |
| Capacity auction reform | June deadline to study long-duration alternatives |

Context: Week of whiplash — PJM first cut near-term demand forecasts (~4.5 GW through 2032), then raised longer-term forecasts, then released BYOG proposals after political pressure from Trump and state governors.

White House directive: Emergency auction for $15B in 15-year supply contracts. Only ~6-7 GW vs ~40 GW needed by early 2030s — political signaling.

Meta-Vistra deal: Just before BYOG news, [[Meta]] signed 20-year PPA with [[Vistra]] for 2.6 GW from 3 nuclear plants in OH/PA. ~5/6 is existing capacity — exactly what BYOG targets.

Market reaction (Jan 17): [[Vistra]], [[Constellation Energy]], [[Talen Energy]] shares all fell sharply.

CreditSights warning: Grid connection requests >2x consensus datacenter demand forecast — bubble forming?

Investment implications:
- Era of hyperscalers grabbing existing capacity at premium may be ending
- Natural gas and grid batteries win (can build fast)
- Incumbents face policy risk

## China cement collapse

[[China]] cement output down ~30% since 2020, expected 6th consecutive year of decline in 2026.

Key data:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global peak (2021) | 4.4B tons |
| China share | ~50% of global |
| China decline since 2020 | -30% |
| China peak per-capita (2014) | 1.8 tons |
| China current per-capita | ~1.2 tons |
| Global avg (ex-China) | 0.31 tons |

Why this matters: Cement consumption peaks during urbanization then collapses — unlike oil/copper which plateau at high-income levels. UK/US use same cement per-capita as Burkina Faso. China building starts at 2003 levels but cement output still 2x higher — more decline ahead.

Implications:
- Construction boom structurally over (not cyclical)
- Good for climate (cement = 8% of global emissions)
- No replacement demand (India adds ~50M tons vs 350M China shortfall)

## Germany fiscal package skepticism

[[Germany]]'s €1T Merz fiscal package facing skepticism about investment quality.

Key concerns (Bloomberg Opinion, Lionel Laurent):
- ~€850B federal borrowing by 2029 — inflates debt ~50% vs end-2024
- €125B minimum could go to non-investment items (Deutsche Bank estimate)
- No significant strengthening of real growth potential expected
- Debt/GDP: 63% → potentially 85% by 2035
- German Council of Economic Experts warns of "squandering" on consumptive spending

Investment breakdown (€500B infrastructure fund):

| Allocation | Guardrails |
|------------|------------|
| €300B federal "additional" | Must be incremental |
| €100B states/municipalities | May plug budget holes |
| €100B climate fund | Includes subsidies |

Growth outlook:
- 6 years of stagnation (real GDP flat since 2019)
- Potential output dropped to ~0.5%
- Bundesbank: 0.9% (2026), 1.4% (2027) — may be peak, not inflection

Leakage mechanisms: Transport spending shifted to new fund, defense exemption frees core budget, pension top-ups absorbing fiscal space.

## Eskom seeks cheap power partners (Davos)

[[Eskom]] Chairman Mteto Nyati at Davos: [[South Africa]]'s state utility seeking international partners to realize cheap industrial power as basis for reindustrialization.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tariff trajectory | 8x increase since 2008 |
| Industrial impact | Aluminum smelters closing, mining constrained |
| Partners sought | [[Japan]], [[China]] -- industrialization models |
| Goal | Reverse deindustrialization via cheap electricity |

Context: South Africa studying how Japan and China used cheap electricity to build heavy industry post-war/reform. Eskom wants to reverse the damage -- tariffs rose 8x while the grid was unreliable for a decade.
