## Fed independence: Supreme Court skeptical

The [[Fed independence]] saga reached the Supreme Court today. **At least 6 justices** — including Trump appointees Kavanaugh and Barrett — questioned the administration's attempt to fire Fed Governor [[Lisa Cook]].

**Key moments:**
- [[Jerome Powell]] and Ben Bernanke watched from gallery
- Kavanaugh warned: "what goes around, comes around" — future presidents could fire appointees at will
- Cook's alleged mortgage fraud (dual primary residences in 2021) — NBC obtained documents appearing to contradict the claim
- No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in 112 years

**Cook's statement:** "This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure."

**Outcome:** Court appears likely to block the firing, at least temporarily.
