## [[Arista Networks]] Q4 2025 — $2.49B revenue (+29% YoY), first $1B+ net income quarter, guides Q1 $2.6B

Massive quarter. FY2025 revenue hit $9.0B (+28.6%), operating margin 47.5%. 150M cumulative ports milestone. Acquired VeloCloud SD-WAN from [[Broadcom]].

## January 2026 CPI — 2.4% headline, 2.5% core (lowest since Mar 2021)

[[BLS]] released January CPI today (delayed by partial government shutdown):

| Measure | January 2026 | December 2025 | MoM |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Headline YoY | 2.4% | 2.7% | +0.2% MoM |
| Core YoY | 2.5% | 2.6% | +0.3% MoM |
| Shelter YoY | 3.0% | — | +0.2% MoM |

Both below consensus (2.5% / 2.6% est). Core 2.5% is lowest since March 2021. Energy -0.1% (gasoline -7.5%), used cars -2.0%.

Caveat: BLS used carry-forward methodology for Dec 2025 – Apr 2026 due to 43-day government shutdown. Likely downward bias.

Fed: ~94% expect rates to hold at 3.50-3.75%. 10Y at 4.09%. Markets pricing 63bp of 2026 cuts.

## [[BYD]], [[Geely]], [[VinFast]] finalists for 230K-unit [[Nissan]]-[[Mercedes-Benz]] Mexico plant

Three finalists bidding for the COMPAS factory in [[Aguascalientes]], [[Mexico]] — a $1B JV plant closing May 2026 as Nissan cancels Infiniti models and Mercedes moves GLB production to [[Hungary]]. ~3,600 jobs at stake. Nine companies initially expressed interest (including [[Chery]], [[Great Wall Motor]]). BYD had abandoned a greenfield Mexico factory due to red tape — acquiring an existing plant bypasses that. Chinese auto brands now ~10% of Mexico's ~1.5M annual market (0% in 2020). Mexico economy ministry quietly stalling Chinese investment pending US trade talks, but can't legally block a private sale.

This is the Mexico manufacturing pathway from [[Chinese EVs enter US]] thesis materializing — an existing 230K-capacity plant could restart production within months, vs years for greenfield.

## [[Morgan Stanley]] lifts US GDP forecast to 2.6% on surging hyperscaler capex

Analyst Michael Gapen raised MS's 2026 real GDP forecast from 2.4% to 2.6%, citing "both demand-side and supply-side elements."

The capex numbers are staggering:

| Metric | Prior estimate | New estimate |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Hyperscaler capex 2026 | $603B | $720B |
| Hyperscaler capex 2027 | $702B | $882B |
| Hyperscaler bond issuance 2026 | — | ~$400B (up from $165B in 2025) |

Key context from MS research:
- "Fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy are all getting easier — all at the same time, all around the world"
- AI capex currently ~0.8% of US GDP (Goldman estimate)
- MS also flagging small-cap rotation opportunity — Russell 2000 to benefit as "gas pedal stays down"
- Mike Wilson separately noted a "pause that refreshes" for big tech, creating opening for small caps

This is bullish for the entire AI infrastructure stack: [[NVIDIA]], [[Applied Materials]], [[Arista Networks]], power/energy, data center REITs.

## [[Private credit]] software concentration — AI disruption threatens $3T market's biggest sector bet

Bloomberg/CNBC reporting on private credit's massive software exposure. Software = 17% of BDC investments, $597-681B in speculative-grade credit. UBS warns defaults could hit 13% in aggressive AI disruption scenario. Anthropic's new AI tools triggered selloff: Ares -12%, Blue Owl -8%, KKR -10%, TPG -7%. Despite warnings, firms keep lending — Blue Owl led $1.4B for OneStream, Ares €1.4B for EG A/S. Jamie Dimon's "cockroaches" warning from 2025 keeps resurfacing. Updated [[Private credit]] concept note with full software concentration section.

## [[Wesleyan Endowment]] FY 2025 — 8.2% return, $1.64B AUM, 15-year annualized 10.2%

Created actor note from full FY 2025 year-end letter. CIO Anne Martin grew endowment from $513M (2010) to $1.64B — $1.5B in gains, $346M in estimated excess returns vs peers over 15 years. FY 2025 underperformed (8.2% vs 13.2% passive 70/30) due to no Mag 7 exposure, biotech drag, and VC (25% allocation) still recovering. Absolute return best at 14.7%, buyout 12.0%. AI disruption explicitly acknowledged as double-edged risk to portfolio.

## Created [[GDP growth forecasts]] concept note

Consolidated IMF WEO (Jan 2026), World Bank (Jan 2026), and vault data into a single tracking note. Covers 20+ countries with forecast comparison by source (IMF, Goldman, World Bank, FOMC, Fitch, Deutsche Bank) and a revision history table for tracking how 2026 outlooks evolved across WEO vintages.

## [[SpaceX]] weighing [[Dual-class shares]] structure for mid-2026 IPO

Bloomberg reports (Feb 13) SpaceX considering a formal dual-class share structure for its planned IPO. [[Elon Musk]] holds ~42% equity but ~79% voting control — the dual-class structure would formalize this for public markets, ensuring control survives dilution from the $30-50B raise.

Follows the tech founder-control playbook: [[Google]] (2004, 10:1), [[Meta]] (2012, 10:1), [[Snap]] (2017, zero public votes). S&P reversed its dual-class ban in April 2023, so index inclusion no longer blocked — but [[Council of Institutional Investors]] and governance-focused funds push for sunset provisions. SpaceX hasn't indicated any.

At $1.5T target valuation, this would be the largest dual-class IPO in history. Updated [[SpaceX]] actor note. Created [[Dual-class shares]] concept note.

## Created [[FDI flows]] concept note

Consolidated UNCTAD (WIR 2025 + Jan 2026 Trends Monitor), OECD, ECLAC, and vault data into a single tracker. Covers global FDI totals (2022-2025), top recipient countries with dollar amounts, top source countries, sectoral breakdown (data centers now >20% of greenfield), and country deep-dives for US, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, ASEAN, Africa. Key finding: 2025 rebound to $1.6T (+14%) is misleading — $140B+ is conduit flows. Developing countries actually declined 2%. China's three-year inflow decline (-40% from peak) contrasts with record outbound. Links to [[Capital flow reversal]], [[China plus one]], [[Manufacturing reshoring]].

## [[BlockFills]] suspends withdrawals — [[Susquehanna]]-backed crypto lender freezes amid BTC crash

[[BlockFills]], a Chicago-based crypto lender/trading firm backed by [[Susquehanna]] Private Equity and [[CME Group]], suspended all client deposits and withdrawals (~Feb 7). The firm handled ~$61B in trading volume in 2025 across 2,000+ institutional clients. [[Bitcoin]] had fallen from its Oct 2025 ATH of $126K to briefly below $60K.

Key difference from 2022: institutional plumbing is breaking first this time (BlockFills serves hedge funds and asset managers), not retail (Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager). BlockFills is a known lender to [[Bitcoin]] miners operating at thin margins — forced collateral liquidation could create a negative feedback loop.

FT Alphaville framing: crypto has evolved into the fractional reserve system Bitcoin was designed to replace. Futures/derivatives markets may trade "paper Bitcoin" without full on-chain backing.

Separately: Newly released Epstein emails show his $525K to [[MIT]]'s Digital Currency Initiative funded three Bitcoin Core developers (Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields) in 2015 after the Bitcoin Foundation's bankruptcy. [[Joichi Ito]] used [[Jeffrey Epstein]]'s gift funds to recruit them. MIT's DCI became the institutional home for Bitcoin's core development — partially underwritten by a convicted sex offender.

Created [[BlockFills]] actor note. Updated [[Bitcoin]], [[Crypto]], [[Susquehanna]], [[Jeffrey Epstein]], [[MIT]].
