## January 2026 CPI — 2.4% headline, 2.5% core (lowest since Mar 2021)

[[BLS]] released January CPI today (delayed by partial government shutdown):

| Measure | January 2026 | December 2025 | MoM |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Headline YoY | 2.4% | 2.7% | +0.2% MoM |
| Core YoY | 2.5% | 2.6% | +0.3% MoM |
| Shelter YoY | 3.0% | — | +0.2% MoM |

Both below consensus (2.5% / 2.6% est). Core 2.5% is lowest since March 2021. Energy -0.1% (gasoline -7.5%), used cars -2.0%.

Caveat: BLS used carry-forward methodology for Dec 2025 – Apr 2026 due to 43-day government shutdown. Likely downward bias.

Fed: ~94% expect rates to hold at 3.50-3.75%. 10Y at 4.09%. Markets pricing 63bp of 2026 cuts.

## [[BYD]], [[Geely]], [[VinFast]] finalists for 230K-unit [[Nissan]]-[[Mercedes-Benz]] Mexico plant

Three finalists bidding for the COMPAS factory in [[Aguascalientes]], [[Mexico]] — a $1B JV plant closing May 2026 as Nissan cancels Infiniti models and Mercedes moves GLB production to [[Hungary]]. ~3,600 jobs at stake. Nine companies initially expressed interest (including [[Chery]], [[Great Wall Motor]]). BYD had abandoned a greenfield Mexico factory due to red tape — acquiring an existing plant bypasses that. Chinese auto brands now ~10% of Mexico's ~1.5M annual market (0% in 2020). Mexico economy ministry quietly stalling Chinese investment pending US trade talks, but can't legally block a private sale.

This is the Mexico manufacturing pathway from [[Chinese EVs enter US]] thesis materializing — an existing 230K-capacity plant could restart production within months, vs years for greenfield.

## [[China]] AI infrastructure billionaires — Bloomberg Billionaires Index (Feb 2, 2026)

![[china-ai-billionaires-bloomberg-feb2026.png]]
*Source: Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Feb 2, 2026. Net worth of founders in China's AI infrastructure sector.*

| Name | Company | Net Worth |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Chen Tianshi | [[Cambricon Technologies]] | $21.53B |
| Wang Weixiu | [[Zhongji Innolight]] | $14.35B |
| Zhou Chaonan | [[Range Intelligent]] | $10.96B |
| Chen Tao | [[Victory Giant]] | $9.35B |
| Cai Huabo | [[Longsys Electronics]] | $7.07B |
| Zhang Jianzhong | [[Moore Threads]] | $4.16B |

Total: ~$67.4B in founder wealth across six AI infrastructure companies. [[Cambricon Technologies]] founder tops the list — remarkable given the company was a ~$5.5B market cap CAS spinoff. The wealth concentration in AI picks-and-shovels (chips, optical, memory, compute) mirrors the US pattern ([[NVIDIA]], [[Broadcom]]) but in a sanctions-constrained domestic market.

## [[Morgan Stanley]] lifts US GDP forecast to 2.6% on surging hyperscaler capex

Analyst Michael Gapen raised MS's 2026 real GDP forecast from 2.4% to **2.6%**, citing "both demand-side and supply-side elements."

The capex numbers are staggering:

| Metric | Prior estimate | New estimate |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Hyperscaler capex 2026 | $603B | **$720B** |
| Hyperscaler capex 2027 | $702B | **$882B** |
| Hyperscaler bond issuance 2026 | — | ~$400B (up from $165B in 2025) |

Key context from MS research:
- "Fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy are all getting easier — all at the same time, all around the world"
- AI capex currently ~0.8% of US GDP (Goldman estimate)
- MS also flagging small-cap rotation opportunity — Russell 2000 to benefit as "gas pedal stays down"
- Mike Wilson separately noted a "pause that refreshes" for big tech, creating opening for small caps

This is bullish for the entire AI infrastructure stack: [[NVIDIA]], [[Applied Materials]], [[Arista Networks]], power/energy, data center REITs.
