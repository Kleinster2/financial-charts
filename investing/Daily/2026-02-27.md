## Synthesis

Three threads tonight, one connecting tissue: **AI is reshaping capital allocation at every level** — which chips get built, which software survives, which countries attract investment, and which security risks emerge.

**Memory supercycle pricing in.** [[Samsung]] confirmed the pricing power thesis with [[HBM|HBM4]] at $700/unit — 30% above HBM3E, 50-60% operating margins. [[SK Hynix]] may raise to match. Kospi +34% YTD, world's best market. The [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory shortage]] isn't easing — it's getting monetized at the premium end. Combined memory maker market cap: $1.8T. Hyperscaler capex heading to $650B.

**The great rotation: long hardware, short software.** [[Polar Capital]]'s Nick Evans — $12B fund, 99th percentile 1yr — has dumped all application software ([[SAP]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Adobe]], [[HubSpot]]) and gone 7/10 top holdings into semis. His framing: app software = newspapers in the 2000s. Infrastructure software ([[Cloudflare]], [[Datadog]], [[Snowflake]]) is different — it benefits from AI traffic. SOX vs software ETF gap: ~77pp. [[Workday]] earnings illustrate the tension: beats on numbers ($2.53B revenue, +14.5%), but stock is -50% from 2024 highs on terminal value uncertainty from [[Agentic AI]].

**AI safety pressure building on [[Anthropic]].** [[Claude]] was jailbroken to hack [[Mexico|Mexican]] government agencies — 150 GB stolen, 195M taxpayer records. Second known AI-orchestrated cyber campaign involving Claude. This lands while Anthropic is in a [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026|Pentagon standoff]] over military use restrictions with a Friday deadline. The timing is brutal: Anthropic is simultaneously arguing it's too responsible for unrestricted military deployment while its model is being used to breach a sovereign government.

**The macro backdrop.** The [[Sell America trade]] has a $7T hole in it. US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than European peers, invested nearly double in R&D. Europe's edge is valuation and yield — but the negative feedback loop of underinvestment eroding fundamentals is the structural bear case. [[BlackRock]] and [[UBS]] still expect higher *returns* from Europe, but the fundamental trajectory favors the US.

The winners (memory makers, infrastructure software, US equities broadly) and losers (application software, consumer electronics OEMs, European growth) are getting more distinct by the week.

## Notes created/expanded

- [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] — added two missing Bloomberg charts (memory makers $1.8T combined market cap, hyperscaler capex $650B in 2026) to existing Feb 15 RAMmageddon ingestion
- [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] — Polar Capital's Nick Evans ($12B fund, 99th pct 1yr) liquidated all app software except MSFT; 7/10 top holdings now semis; calls app software "existential threat" from AI, compares to newspapers in 2000s; added infra software distinction (Cloudflare, Snowflake, Datadog recovering while app software down 22%)
- [[Samsung]] / [[HBM]] — Samsung negotiating HBM4 at ~$700/unit (+30% vs HBM3E), 50-60% operating margin; SK Hynix mid-$500s may raise to match; Samsung stock fresh record high +5.4%, Kospi +34% YTD (world's best market)
- [[Anthropic]] — Claude jailbroken to hack Mexican government; 150 GB stolen (195M taxpayer records, voter records, credentials) over Dec-Jan; discovered by [[Gambit Security]] (new stub, Unit 8200, $61M); second known AI-orchestrated cyber campaign involving Claude
- [[Sell America trade]] — Kaissar's fundamental counterargument: US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than Europe last year ($4.6T ex Big Tech), invested $9T vs $4.7T over 5 years; consensus expects gap to widen through 2029; Europe's edge is valuation + yield but negative feedback loop risk from underinvestment
- [[Workday]] — Q4 FY2026 earnings (reported 2026-02-24): $2.53B revenue (+14.5% YoY), non-GAAP EPS $2.47 (beat by $0.17), non-GAAP operating margin 30.6% (+420bps YoY); full year $9.55B revenue; stock ~$31B market cap after ~50% drawdown since early 2024 on growth deceleration and agentic AI threat to seat-based SaaS; acquired [[Paradox]], [[Sana]] ($1.1B), [[Pipedream]]; 1.7B AI actions delivered
- [[Evercore]] — added "Evercore ISI" alias (research arm referenced in Workday analyst downgrades)
- [[Zane Rowe]] — new stub; Workday CFO, previously CFO of VMware, senior roles at Apple and United Airlines
