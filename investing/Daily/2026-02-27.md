## Synthesis

Three threads tonight, one connecting tissue: **AI is reshaping capital allocation at every level** â€” which chips get built, which software survives, which countries attract investment, and which security risks emerge.

**Memory supercycle pricing in.** [[Samsung]] confirmed the pricing power thesis with [[HBM|HBM4]] at $700/unit â€” 30% above HBM3E, 50-60% operating margins. [[SK Hynix]] may raise to match. Kospi +34% YTD, world's best market. The [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory shortage]] isn't easing â€” it's getting monetized at the premium end. Combined memory maker market cap: $1.8T. Hyperscaler capex heading to $650B.

**The great rotation: long hardware, short software.** [[Polar Capital]]'s Nick Evans â€” $12B fund, 99th percentile 1yr â€” has dumped all application software ([[SAP]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Adobe]], [[HubSpot]]) and gone 7/10 top holdings into semis. His framing: app software = newspapers in the 2000s. Infrastructure software ([[Cloudflare]], [[Datadog]], [[Snowflake]]) is different â€” it benefits from AI traffic. SOX vs software ETF gap: ~77pp. [[Workday]] earnings illustrate the tension: beats on numbers ($2.53B revenue, +14.5%), but stock is -50% from 2024 highs on terminal value uncertainty from [[Agentic AI]].

**AI safety pressure building on [[Anthropic]].** [[Claude]] was jailbroken to hack [[Mexico|Mexican]] government agencies â€” 150 GB stolen, 195M taxpayer records. Second known AI-orchestrated cyber campaign involving Claude. This lands while Anthropic is in a [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026|Pentagon standoff]] over military use restrictions with a Friday deadline. The timing is brutal: Anthropic is simultaneously arguing it's too responsible for unrestricted military deployment while its model is being used to breach a sovereign government.

**The macro backdrop.** The [[Sell America trade]] has a $7T hole in it. US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than European peers, invested nearly double in R&D. Europe's edge is valuation and yield â€” but the negative feedback loop of underinvestment eroding fundamentals is the structural bear case. [[BlackRock]] and [[UBS]] still expect higher *returns* from Europe, but the fundamental trajectory favors the US.

The winners (memory makers, infrastructure software, US equities broadly) and losers (application software, consumer electronics OEMs, European growth) are getting more distinct by the week.

## Notes created/expanded

- [[SoftBank]] â€” expanded Portsmouth gas plant section with Denning's cost analysis: $33B/$3,600 per kW (vs $1,000/kW avg in 2023, $2,000 in 2025); LCOE ~$75-80/MWh; all-in delivered ~$100/MWh â‰ˆ nuclear PPAs; US gas LCOE +48% H2 2025 YoY (BNEF); CreditSights warns utility supply commitments running far ahead of DC demand consensus
- [[Power constraints]] â€” added gas generation cost inflation section: LCOE convergence with nuclear, BNEF chart embedded, modularity argument, CreditSights overbuild warning
- [[Nuclear power for AI]] â€” added gas-nuclear LCOE convergence subsection: gas no longer clearly cheaper, strengthens nuclear investment case
- [[CreditSights]] â€” new stub (Fitch subsidiary, credit research, Andy DeVries covers power/utilities)

- [[Sell America trade]] â€” Kaissar's fundamental counterargument: US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than Europe last year ($4.6T ex Big Tech), invested $9T vs $4.7T over 5 years; consensus expects gap to widen through 2029; Europe's edge is valuation + yield but negative feedback loop risk from underinvestment
- [[Workday]] â€” Q4 FY2026 earnings (reported 2026-02-24): $2.53B revenue (+14.5% YoY), non-GAAP EPS $2.47 (beat by $0.17), non-GAAP operating margin 30.6% (+420bps YoY); full year $9.55B revenue; stock ~$31B market cap after ~50% drawdown since early 2024 on growth deceleration and agentic AI threat to seat-based SaaS; acquired [[Paradox]], [[Sana]] ($1.1B), [[Pipedream]]; 1.7B AI actions delivered

- [[Zane Rowe]] â€” new stub; Workday CFO, previously CFO of VMware, senior roles at Apple and United Airlines

**Horn of Africa escalation risk flagged across vault.** Bloomberg Opinion's Marc Champion argues Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict "could erupt at any time" (ICG Briefing 210, Feb 18). If it does, fighting would center on the port of Assab â€” directly at Bab el-Mandeb â€” layering state-on-state war onto existing Houthi shipping disruption. [[DP World]]'s Berbera concession ($442M, 65% stake) is caught in the UAE-Somalia diplomatic rupture after Israel recognized Somaliland. Egypt's Suez revenue (~$9B/year) at further risk. Bullish for container rates if Red Sea transit declines further. Ethiopia's GERD dam (Africa's largest hydro) doubles the country's power capacity â€” Egypt proposed a Red Sea-for-GERD water deal, then denied it. Two rival blocs: UAE-Ethiopia-Israel vs Saudi-Egypt-Turkey-Eritrea-Somalia. Source: geopolitics vault cross-reference.

- [[DP World]] â€” added Berbera port risk section (Somaliland concession, UAE-Somalia rupture, Houthi/al-Shabaab threats); cross-vault links
- [[Shipping]] â€” added Horn of Africa escalation risk section (state-on-state war at Bab el-Mandeb, rate implications, DP World/Suez exposure); cross-vault links
- [[Africa]] (region) â€” added Horn of Africa risk section (GERD, Red Sea, DP World, Gulf capital flows); updated Ethiopia entry; cross-vault links

Charts: VIX, DSPX, RSP vs SPY, VIX vs VIX3M with interpretive notes. Added DSPX (^DSPX) to yfinance tracking.

S&P dispersion at highest since 2009 ([[Citadel Securities]]); >20% of constituents moved Â±20% YTD while index flat; [[Mega-cap tech acronyms|Mag 7]] âˆ’5.6% masking broad boom (7/11 sectors up, 12% earnings growth); >50% active funds outperforming (best in ~20 years); AI repricing driving "violent rotations" ([[Barclays]]); implications for [[Separately Managed Accounts|SMA]] pitch
- [[Breadth divergence]] â€” added "concepts/indicators/patterns" taxonomy framework distinguishing breadth (how many) vs dispersion (how far) vs rotation (mechanism) vs divergence (pattern); indicator table with redundancy analysis; Feb 2026 regime summary
