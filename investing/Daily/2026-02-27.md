## Synthesis

Three threads tonight, one connecting tissue: **AI is reshaping capital allocation at every level** — which chips get built, which software survives, which countries attract investment, and which security risks emerge.

**Memory supercycle pricing in.** [[Samsung]] confirmed the pricing power thesis with [[HBM|HBM4]] at $700/unit — 30% above HBM3E, 50-60% operating margins. [[SK Hynix]] may raise to match. Kospi +34% YTD, world's best market. The [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory shortage]] isn't easing — it's getting monetized at the premium end. Combined memory maker market cap: $1.8T. Hyperscaler capex heading to $650B.

**The great rotation: long hardware, short software.** [[Polar Capital]]'s Nick Evans — $12B fund, 99th percentile 1yr — has dumped all application software ([[SAP]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Adobe]], [[HubSpot]]) and gone 7/10 top holdings into semis. His framing: app software = newspapers in the 2000s. Infrastructure software ([[Cloudflare]], [[Datadog]], [[Snowflake]]) is different — it benefits from AI traffic. SOX vs software ETF gap: ~77pp. [[Workday]] earnings illustrate the tension: beats on numbers ($2.53B revenue, +14.5%), but stock is -50% from 2024 highs on terminal value uncertainty from [[Agentic AI]].

**AI safety pressure building on [[Anthropic]].** [[Claude]] was jailbroken to hack [[Mexico|Mexican]] government agencies — 150 GB stolen, 195M taxpayer records. Second known AI-orchestrated cyber campaign involving Claude. This lands while Anthropic is in a [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026|Pentagon standoff]] over military use restrictions with a Friday deadline. The timing is brutal: Anthropic is simultaneously arguing it's too responsible for unrestricted military deployment while its model is being used to breach a sovereign government.

**The macro backdrop.** The [[Sell America trade]] has a $7T hole in it. US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than European peers, invested nearly double in R&D. Europe's edge is valuation and yield — but the negative feedback loop of underinvestment eroding fundamentals is the structural bear case. [[BlackRock]] and [[UBS]] still expect higher *returns* from Europe, but the fundamental trajectory favors the US.

The winners (memory makers, infrastructure software, US equities broadly) and losers (application software, consumer electronics OEMs, European growth) are getting more distinct by the week.

## Notes created/expanded

- [[SoftBank]] — expanded Portsmouth gas plant section with Denning's cost analysis: $33B/$3,600 per kW (vs $1,000/kW avg in 2023, $2,000 in 2025); LCOE ~$75-80/MWh; all-in delivered ~$100/MWh ≈ nuclear PPAs; US gas LCOE +48% H2 2025 YoY (BNEF); CreditSights warns utility supply commitments running far ahead of DC demand consensus

**Horn of Africa escalation risk flagged across vault.** Bloomberg Opinion's Marc Champion argues Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict "could erupt at any time" (ICG Briefing 210, Feb 18). If it does, fighting would center on the port of Assab — directly at Bab el-Mandeb — layering state-on-state war onto existing Houthi shipping disruption. [[DP World]]'s Berbera concession ($442M, 65% stake) is caught in the UAE-Somalia diplomatic rupture after Israel recognized Somaliland. Egypt's Suez revenue (~$9B/year) at further risk. Bullish for container rates if Red Sea transit declines further. Ethiopia's GERD dam (Africa's largest hydro) doubles the country's power capacity — Egypt proposed a Red Sea-for-GERD water deal, then denied it. Two rival blocs: UAE-Ethiopia-Israel vs Saudi-Egypt-Turkey-Eritrea-Somalia. Source: geopolitics vault cross-reference.

- [[DP World]] — added Berbera port risk section (Somaliland concession, UAE-Somalia rupture, Houthi/al-Shabaab threats); cross-vault links
- [[Shipping]] — added Horn of Africa escalation risk section (state-on-state war at Bab el-Mandeb, rate implications, DP World/Suez exposure); cross-vault links

Charts: VIX, DSPX, RSP vs SPY, VIX vs VIX3M with interpretive notes. Added DSPX (^DSPX) to yfinance tracking.
- [[Single stock dispersion]] — new concept note. S&P dispersion at highest since 2009 ([[Citadel Securities]]); >20% of constituents moved ±20% YTD while index flat; [[Mega-cap tech acronyms|Mag 7]] −5.6% masking broad boom (7/11 sectors up, 12% earnings growth); >50% active funds outperforming (best in ~20 years); AI repricing driving "violent rotations" ([[Barclays]]); implications for [[Separately Managed Accounts|SMA]] pitch
- [[Breadth divergence]] — added "concepts/indicators/patterns" taxonomy framework distinguishing breadth (how many) vs dispersion (how far) vs rotation (mechanism) vs divergence (pattern); indicator table with redundancy analysis; Feb 2026 regime summary

## Franco-German defense friction deepens

Bloomberg Opinion (Lionel Laurent, Feb 27): [[Germany]]'s defense peacocking becoming destabilizing for European coordination.

**Key facts:**
- German defense budget heading to **€162B ($191B) by 2029** — Berlin explicitly criticized [[France]] for not spending enough
- [[FCAS]] ($115B 6th-gen fighter program) falling apart: [[Dassault Aviation]] demands leadership, [[Airbus]] wants equal work share, former Airbus CEO Tom Enders calls FCAS a "mistake" (FT), prefers Germany joining [[UK]]-led [[Global Combat Air Programme]]
- Berlin reportedly eyeing own fighter jet program AND own satellite constellation — "Germany First" risk in European defense
- [[Friedrich Merz]] opposes joint European borrowing; Macron pushes it as path to European self-reliance
- Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel — hardly a dove — making case for mutual European defense debt
- Liana Fix (CFR): Germany's combined economic + military power = "involuntary hegemony" that partners may want to constrain
- Franco-German tank (MGCS) also falling significantly behind
- **NATO Europe expected to spend €831B/year by 2035** — but fragmented national procurement sacrifices scale and interoperability
- Proposed grand bargain: France shares nuclear deterrent with Germany in return for joint defense financing
- Poll (Internationale Politik): 73% of Europeans believe continent must ensure own defense
