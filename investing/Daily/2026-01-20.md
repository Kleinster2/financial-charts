## Photoresist industry summary

### Market structure

**Japan dominance:** JSR + TOK + Shin-Etsu = ~90% of EUV photoresists

| Company | Share | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private | JIC took private June 2024 |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | 4186.T | Best public pure-play |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | 4063.T | Also #1 in wafers |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | 4901.T | Diversified (healthcare dominant) |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | 4005.T | Aggressive expansion |
| [[Qnity]] | ~7% | Q | US pure-play, DuPont spin |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | MRK.DE | Europe, diversified |

Top 7 = 86% of IC photoresist market.

### Why it matters

- **Chokepoint:** No EUV photoresist = no leading-edge chips
- **Japan monopoly:** Export controls on equipment; Japan controls materials
- **Investment angle:** JSR going private leaves TOK as cleanest pure-play

### Market size

- Global photoresist: ~$5B (2024) → ~$6.7B (2030)
- EUV photoresist: ~$250M (2025) → fastest growing segment (25%+ CAGR)
