## Photoresist industry summary

### Market structure

**Japan dominance:** JSR + TOK + Shin-Etsu = ~90% of EUV photoresists

| Company | Share | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private | JIC took private June 2024 |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | 4186.T | Best public pure-play |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | 4063.T | Also #1 in wafers |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | 4901.T | Diversified (healthcare dominant) |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | 4005.T | Aggressive expansion |
| [[Qnity]] | ~7% | Q | US pure-play, DuPont spin |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | MRK.DE | Europe, diversified |

Top 7 = 86% of IC photoresist market.

### Why it matters

- **Chokepoint:** No EUV photoresist = no leading-edge chips
- **Japan monopoly:** Export controls on equipment; Japan controls materials
- **Investment angle:** JSR going private leaves TOK as cleanest pure-play

### Market size

- Global photoresist: ~$5B (2024) → ~$6.7B (2030)
- EUV photoresist: ~$250M (2025) → fastest growing segment (25%+ CAGR)

## Hyperscaler capex analysis

### Chart created

Added `capex` metric to chart API and generated comparison:

![[hyperscaler-capex.png]]
*[[Amazon]] · [[Google]] · [[Meta]] · [[Microsoft]] · [[Oracle]]*

### Key findings (Q3 2025 quarterly capex)

| Hyperscaler | Q3 2019 | Q3 2025 | Multiple |
|-------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **AMZN** | $4.7B | $35.1B | **7.5x** |
| **GOOG** | $6.7B | $24.0B | **3.6x** |
| **META** | $3.5B | $18.8B | **5.4x** |
| **MSFT** | $3.4B | $19.4B | **5.7x** |

**Combined Q3 2025:** $97.3B quarterly → ~$390B annualized run rate
