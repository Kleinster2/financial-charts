## Zo Computer — managed alternative to OpenClaw

Research into [[Zo Computer]], the "AI Cloud OS" positioning itself as the managed alternative to [[Clawdbot viral growth|OpenClaw]]'s local-first chaos.

**Founder:** [[Ben Guo]] (@0thernet)
- Stripe 2015-2023 (8 years)
- Venmo 2013
- Harvard
- Brooklyn-based

**Positioning:** "AWS for your mom" — same value prop as OpenClaw (AI that does things), opposite architecture:

| | OpenClaw | Zo Computer |
|--|----------|-------------|
| Architecture | Local-first, DIY | Cloud-hosted, managed |
| Security | Your problem | Their problem |
| Setup | VPS, tunnels, config | Instant |
| Target | Technical power users | Everyone |

**Traction signals:**
- Pieter Levels: "They made vibe coding into a product"
- Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO): "This is the iPhone moment for servers"
- Sunil Pai (Cloudflare): "I love this"

**Product dynamics:**
The [[Clawdbot viral growth]] event validated massive demand for agentic AI. Market is now bifurcating:
1. **DIY/local-first** — OpenClaw, security nightmares, max control
2. **Managed/cloud** — Zo et al, security handled, broader market

Ben Guo explicitly: "Clawdbot is the homebrew version of Zo... I think [managed] will always be the better choice for most people."

**Related to Substrate** (AI compute engine) — same team or built on their infra.
