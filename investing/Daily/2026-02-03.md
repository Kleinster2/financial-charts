## Zo Computer — managed alternative to OpenClaw

Research into [[Zo Computer]], the "AI Cloud OS" positioning itself as the managed alternative to [[Clawdbot viral growth|OpenClaw]]'s local-first chaos.

**Founder:** [[Ben Guo]] (@0thernet)
- Stripe 2015-2023 (8 years)
- Venmo 2013
- Harvard
- Brooklyn-based

**Positioning:** "AWS for your mom" — same value prop as OpenClaw (AI that does things), opposite architecture:

| | OpenClaw | Zo Computer |
|--|----------|-------------|
| Architecture | Local-first, DIY | Cloud-hosted, managed |
| Security | Your problem | Their problem |
| Setup | VPS, tunnels, config | Instant |
| Target | Technical power users | Everyone |

**Traction signals:**
- Pieter Levels: "They made vibe coding into a product"
- Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO): "This is the iPhone moment for servers"
- Sunil Pai (Cloudflare): "I love this"

**Product dynamics:**
The [[Clawdbot viral growth]] event validated massive demand for agentic AI. Market is now bifurcating:
1. **DIY/local-first** — OpenClaw, security nightmares, max control
2. **Managed/cloud** — Zo et al, security handled, broader market

Ben Guo explicitly: "Clawdbot is the homebrew version of Zo... I think [managed] will always be the better choice for most people."

**Related to Substrate** (AI compute engine) — same team or built on their infra.

## SpaceX-xAI merger deep dive

Researched the Feb 2 merger announcement. Created [[SpaceX xAI merger]] event note.

**Key findings:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined valuation | **$1.25T** (largest M&A ever) |
| SpaceX | $1T |
| xAI | $250B |
| Exchange ratio | 0.1433 xAI → SpaceX |

**Strategic thesis:** Space-based AI compute. Musk: "Within 2-3 years, lowest cost to generate AI compute will be in space."

**Real driver:** xAI burning ~$1B/month with burn-to-revenue ratio of 26:1 (vs OpenAI's 0.7:1). $230B valuation only works with exit strategy → merger + IPO provides it.

**12-year arc:** Goes back to 2012 when Demis Hassabis warned Musk that AI could follow humans to Mars and destroy his colony. Court docs show Musk wanted children to control AGI through $80B foundation.

**Regulatory overhang:** Grok under investigation by California AG, 35 state AGs, EU Commission for CSAM and non-consensual imagery. SpaceX holds $22B in government contracts — creates unprecedented conflict.

**IPO:** Expected mid-2026, targeting $1.5T valuation, $30-50B raise (would be largest ever).

## Moltbook security breach

Added Moltbook section to [[Clawdbot viral growth]] event note.

**What it is:** Reddit-style social network for AI agents (1.5M claimed, but only 17K human owners — 88:1 ratio). Vibe-coded by Matt Schlicht.

**Security breach (Wiz, Feb 1-2):**
- Misconfigured Supabase exposed 1.5M API keys, 35K+ emails, private DMs
- Full write access — anyone could modify posts
- OpenAI API keys found in agent-to-agent messages
- Same pattern: vibe-coded without security review

**Agent behavior:** Building religions, unionizing, philosophizing, self-policing (downvoted bot proposing civilization collapse).

Andrej Karpathy called it "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing" he's seen.
