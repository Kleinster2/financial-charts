## Research notes

### Power constraints refactoring

Extracted the three Bloomberg analyses from [[Power constraints]] into dedicated notes:

| New note | Source | Key finding |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [[DC power prices]] | Bloomberg Sep 2025 | 70%+ of price increases within 50mi of DCs |
| [[DC power quality]] | Bloomberg Dec 2024 | AI "sawtooth" loads cause harmonic distortion |
| [[Global DC grid strain]] | Bloomberg Jun 2024 | 7,000+ DCs consume more than most countries |

**Why split:** Power constraints had grown to 620+ lines with detailed Bloomberg data. Now it's a synthesis/overview note (~430 lines) linking to detailed analysis.

### Three dimensions of power constraints

| Constraint | Metric | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Availability** | 44 GW gap | Can't deploy GPUs |
| **Price** | +125-197% wholesale near DC Alley | Consumer burden |
| **Quality** | 8%+ THD in hotspots | Appliance damage, billions in costs |

**Key insight:** Even when power is available and affordable, it may be *distorted* enough to damage equipment.

### Self-compounding constraints

The problem is self-reinforcing:
- Texas offers faster grid connections (1-2 years vs 4+ elsewhere)
- So DCs concentrate there
- But Texas has water constraints
- Pushing toward water-free cooling
- Which uses **5% more energy**

Every constraint pushes DCs toward trade-offs that worsen other constraints.

### EU-China EV tariff deal

EU and China agreed (Jan 12, 2026) to replace punitive tariffs with minimum price floors:

| Old system | New system |
|------------|------------|
| 7.8-35.3% additional duties | Minimum prices per model |
| 45.3% max combined | Price floor commitment |
| Revenue to EU | Margin stays with exporter |

**Key finding:** Most Chinese OEMs had already absorbed tariffs. Deal boosts their margins rather than cutting prices.

**VW broke ranks:** Negotiated individually for Cupra Tavascan (built in Hefei). Committed to limit exports and set minimum prices → 20.7% additional duty dropped.

**Investment implication:** BYD's "European tariff risk" bear case now reduced. Europe remains accessible growth market (unlike US where 100% tariff blocks entry).
