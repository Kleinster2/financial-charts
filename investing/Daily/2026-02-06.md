## Amazon Earnings — AWS Crushes, Capex Stuns

[[Amazon]] reported Q4 2025 after close Thursday:

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $213.4B | $211.3B |
| EPS | $1.95 | $1.97 (miss) |
| YoY revenue | +14% | — |
| AWS revenue | $35B (+24%) | +21.4% |
| AWS growth | Fastest in 13 quarters | — |
| AWS backlog | $244B (+40% YoY) | — |
| Custom chips run rate | $10B | — |
| FY 2025 revenue | $716.9B | — |
| 2026 capex guidance | $200B | $146.6B |

The capex shock: 2026 capex of $200B is 37% above Street expectations. Stock fell 10%+ after hours.

Jassy commentary: "With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200B in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026." Spending "predominantly" goes to AWS.

Custom silicon milestone: Trainium/Inferentia chips hit $10B annual run rate with triple-digit YoY growth. First hyperscaler custom chip business at this scale.

Capex implications: Alphabet $175-185B + Amazon $200B + Meta $115-135B = $500B+ from just 3 hyperscalers. Bullish for [[NVIDIA]], [[Broadcom]], data center REITs, power infrastructure.

Q1 2026 guidance: Revenue $173.5B-$178.5B (+11-15% YoY), roughly in line with $175.5B Street.

## AIWD Basket Splinter

Reviewed [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] performance since Jan 2024. Original thesis wrong on two names:

| Name | Expected | Actual | Why |
|------|----------|--------|-----|
| [[HCL Tech]] | Victim (-25%) | Winner (+21%) | Engineering focus, AI implementation partner |
| [[Publicis]] | Victim (-50%) | Winner (+6%) | Epsilon first-party data moat |

Action: Splintered basket into:
- AIWD (victims): 9 names, pure disruption exposure
- [[AI Transition Winners basket|AITW]] (winners): HCL + Publicis

Performance since Jan 2024: AIWD -11% vs AITW -1% (10pp spread).

Key insight: "Switching costs protect against disruption" thesis failed for legal/data names. TRI -21%, WKL -36%, FDS -54%. LLMs commoditize the value-add (analyst interpretation) faster than subscription stickiness can protect pricing power.

## Semiconductor Industry Hits $1 Trillion

[[SIA]] forecasts the semiconductor industry will reach $1 trillion in revenue in 2026 — first time ever.

| Year | Revenue | YoY |
|------|---------|-----|
| 2024 | $627B | — |
| 2025 | $791.7B | +26% |
| 2026E | $1T+ | +26% |

Key drivers:
- "AI Super-Cycle" — structural shift decoupling from traditional 4-year patterns
- High-value AI chips now ~50% of revenue but <0.2% of unit volume
- [[NVIDIA]]-led boom in data center spend

TSMC A16 node: Volume production H2 2026. Introduces "Super Power Rail" — backside power delivery. Major efficiency gains.

ASML High-NA EUV: $350M machines now in high-volume manufacturing. [[Intel]] first mover at D1X Oregon fab for 14A (1.4nm) node.

## NVIDIA China Explainer — H20 Restricted, Market Fragmenting

Bloomberg published an updated explainer on [[NVIDIA]]'s China dilemma (Feb 6):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| H20 restriction | Aug 2025 (by Biden admin) |
| China chip market | $229B |
| China AI chip spending forecast | $50B/yr |
| Paired domestic purchase mandate | In effect — Chinese buyers must pair imports with domestic chips |

Chinese alternatives surging: [[Moore Threads]] and [[MetaX]] IPOs saw 1,000%+ first-day gains. [[Huawei]] Ascend 910D in production. Bernstein: H200 "would have been amazing 18 months ago" but gap is shrinking.

David Sacks (White House AI czar) acknowledged US needs a "dynamic" China approach. Jensen Huang: "China remains an important market."

---

## PJM Warns of 60 GW Power Shortfall

[[PJM]] — operator of the largest US grid (65M people, 13 states + DC) — warned of a potential 60 GW supply shortfall over the next decade as [[Data Centers|data center]] demand accelerates.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projected shortfall | 60 GW (next decade) |
| Cost to solve | ~$180B |
| Last auction shortfall (Dec 2025) | 6.5 GW |
| Reliability gap starts | Mid-2027 |

Trump administration pushing [[PJM]] to hold emergency wholesale electricity auction in Sep 2026. Discussion about shifting from 12-month to 10-year [[Capacity market|capacity contracts]] — would give generators revenue certainty but expose grid operators to long-term procurement risk.

60 GW = ~60 large nuclear reactors. Most concrete quantification yet of the [[Power infrastructure bottleneck]].

## Canada Pursues Chinese-Canadian EV Joint Venture

[[Canada]] is pursuing a joint venture with Chinese automakers to build EVs in Canada for global export, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly announced.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Canadian partners | [[Magna]], [[Linamar]], [[Martinrea]] |
| Chinese firms met | [[BYD]], [[Chery|Chery Automobile]] |
| EV tariff exemption | 49,000 Chinese-built EVs/year exempt from 100% tariff |
| Software | [[BlackBerry]] QNX to address security concerns |
| Import credit system | Build more in Canada → pay less on US vehicle imports |

Context: [[GM]] laying off at Canadian plants, [[Stellantis]] reneged on Toronto [[Jeep]] factory restart. [[Mark Carney]] government pivoting to diversify away from US dependence after [[Trump II]] tariffs. Honda and [[Toyota]] already produce ~75% of Canadian auto output. [[Hyundai]]/[[Kia]] also targeted — Quebec is the world's biggest Kia market.

## Jensen Huang: AI Capex "Appropriate and Sustainable"

[[NVIDIA]] CEO [[Jensen Huang]] told CNBC that AI infrastructure spending is justified and will continue for 7-8 years. Pushed back on investor panic after Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft guided ~$650B combined 2026 AI capex (those four lost ~$1T in market value during the week).

| Claim | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Buildout timeline | 7-8 years |
| Idle capacity | None — unlike dot-com, no infrastructure sitting unused |
| Revenue quality | [[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]] generating profitable revenue |
| Demand | "Just incredibly high" — adoption accelerating |

Context: Feb 4 at [[Cisco]] event, Huang also called the software stock selloff "the most illogical thing in the world" — software is a tool AI will use, not replace.

## US New Car Prices Break $50,000

Average new car hit $50,326 in December 2025, first time above $50,000 (September). Up 61% since 2010. Takes 36.2 weeks of household income — above pre-Covid norm.

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| SUV/truck shift | Killed sedans (Focus, Cruze), pushed mix upmarket |
| Pandemic aftermath | High-margin, low-volume model persists — incentives still below pre-Covid |
| EV premium | Average EV ~$8K above average car |
| Tariffs | Automakers spreading costs across lineups |
| Regulation | Cameras, advanced metals, safety tech add cost |

US-made OEM average ([[GM]], [[Ford]], [[Stellantis]]): $54,380, 13% above industry average. Buyers earning <$75,000/year leaving new-car market. Auto insurance +65% and repair costs +44% over 5 years compound ownership burden.

EV share: Hit record 10.6% in Q3 2025 (tax credit rush), collapsed to 5.8% in Q4 after $7,500 federal credit expired. Republicans pushing to relax fuel economy rules — NHTSA head called some regs "vestigial."

## Tesla Targets 100 GW Solar Cell Manufacturing

[[Tesla]] evaluating US sites for solar cell production — part of [[Elon Musk]]'s 100 GW/year target (shared with [[SpaceX]]). Would power data centers on Earth and in space.

| Site | Status |
|------|--------|
| Buffalo, NY (existing) | Expansion to 10 GW |
| Second NY facility | Under consideration |
| Arizona | Under consideration |
| Idaho | Under consideration |

Context: US produces only ~3 GW of solar cells annually. [[First Solar]] (current US leader) targets 14 GW in 2026. Tesla's 100 GW would dwarf all US production. FSLR fell ~7%.

Musk: current US solar import tariffs are "gigantic." Tesla/SpaceX teams recently visited Chinese solar equipment companies. Previous SolarCity effort (2016 acquisition) failed to scale.

Led by VP Bonne Eggleston. Musk: "The solar opportunity is underestimated."
