## Software Stocks Collapse — AI Disruption Fear

## OpenAI-Nvidia Tension

[[Reuters]] exclusive revealed friction between the two AI giants:

**The issue:** [[OpenAI]] unsatisfied with speed of [[NVIDIA]] inference chips for specific workloads — particularly [[Codex]] (coding) and agent-to-agent communication. Need for faster "time to first token."

**What OpenAI wants:**
- SRAM-heavy chips (memory embedded on silicon vs external)
- Faster inference for chatbot interactions
- ~10% of inference compute from alternatives eventually

**Deals explored:**
- [[AMD]] GPUs
- [[Cerebras]] — struck commercial deal Jan 2026
- [[Groq]] — talks shut down after Nvidia acquired Groq's tech

**Nvidia's response:** $20B licensing deal to acquire [[Groq]]'s IP in December. Hired away Groq's chip designers.

**Jensen Huang (Feb 3):** Denies drama, says investment in OpenAI remains "on track." Told CNBC's Cramer: "There's no drama involved."

**[[Bloomberg]]:** Huang said $100B investment "was never a commitment."

**Sam Altman (post-story):** Nvidia makes "the best AI chips in the world." OpenAI hopes to remain "gigantic customer for a very long time."

**Investment status:** Nvidia's proposed $100B stake in OpenAI has been delayed for months. Original timeline: close within weeks of Sept 2025 announcement.

[[Citadel]] CEO: Companies using AI as "excuse" for layoffs that are actually post-pandemic right-sizing.

> "AI has gotten a lot of very negative headlines in terms of being the excuse that companies have used to trim their workforces down. But objectively, very few businesses are actually seeing productivity gains that come anywhere close to the headline of job losses."

### Fed's Barkin: "Some distance to travel"

[[Richmond Fed]] President Thomas Barkin: Central bank still has work on inflation. Labor market and inflation drifting lower but still above target. Three 2025 cuts were "insurance" — more progress needed.
