## Markets

Tuesday Feb 3 close — Tech selloff intensifies:

| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,917.81 | -0.84% |
| Nasdaq | 23,255.19 | -1.43% |
| Dow | 49,240.99 | -0.34% |

Wednesday Feb 4 midday:

| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | ~6,930 | +0.17% |
| Dow | ~49,370 | +0.26% |
| Nasdaq | ~23,200 | -0.24% |

Tech lagging again. Rotation into small caps accelerating.

## Russell 2000 — [[Small cap rotation 2026|Great Rotation]]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IWM YTD | +5.8% |
| Nasdaq YTD | +2.0% |
| R2K P/E | 18x |
| S&P P/E | 26x |
| Valuation gap | 25-year extreme |

Strongest R2K start in a decade. Small caps benefit from:
- AI disruption fears hitting large cap tech/software
- "America First" industrial policy (defense contractors, domestic manufacturing)
- Less exposed to Claude Cowork narrative
- Fed accommodation helps rate-sensitive names

Mirror image of software selloff — same catalyst, opposite trade.

![[iwm-vs-qqq.png]]
*IWM (blue) +8% vs QQQ (red) +3% since Oct 2025. Divergence accelerated in Jan 2026.*

Yields (Feb 4 morning):

| Tenor | Yield | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 2Y | 3.577% | +<1bp |
| 10Y | 4.273% | flat |
| 30Y | 4.90% | -<1bp |

Gold reclaimed $5,000/oz — [[Bank of America]] sees path to $6,000. Safe haven bid intensifying.

Bitcoin hit 73,844 — lowest since Nov 6, 2024. Down 15% YTD.

## ADP Jobs Report (Feb 4) — Big Miss

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Private payrolls | +22,000 | 48,000 |
| Annual pay growth | +4.5% | — |
| Prior month | 41,000 | — |

Weakest job growth in months. Supports Fed pause thesis but raises growth concerns.

## Software Stocks Collapse — Claude Cowork Catalyst

The trigger: [[Anthropic]] launched Claude Cowork plugins on Thursday Jan 30 — 11 open-source plugins for legal, sales, marketing, and financial workflows. Cowork itself launched Jan 12 without major market reaction; the plugins targeting specific job functions spooked investors.

The damage: $285B rout across software, financial services, asset management (Bloomberg).

Valuation compression:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Software forward P/E | 33.1x | 23.2x | -30% |

US Software (Feb 3):

| Ticker | Company | Move | YTD |
|--------|---------|------|-----|
| NOW | [[ServiceNow]] | -7% | -28% |
| CRM | [[Salesforce]] | -7% | -26% |
| INTU | [[Intuit]] | -11% | — |
| LZ | [[LegalZoom]] | -20% | — |

Goldman Sachs software basket: -6%

European/Global (Feb 3):

| Ticker | Company | Move | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------|
| TRI | [[Thomson Reuters]] | -18% | Record daily loss, lowest since Jun 2021 |
| REL.L | [[RELX]] | -14% | Worst since 1988, nearly halved from peak |
| WLSNc.AS | [[Wolters Kluwer]] | -13% | Legal analytics |
| FDS | [[FactSet]] | -10.5% | |
| MORN | [[Morningstar]] | -9% | |
| LSEG.L | [[London Stock Exchange Group]] | -12% | |

India IT (Feb 4):

| Ticker | Company | Move |
|--------|---------|------|
| INFY | [[Infosys]] | -7.4% |
| TCS | [[TCS]] | -7% |
| HCLTECH | [[HCL Tech]] | -4.6% |

Advertising also hit:

| Ticker | Company | Move |
|--------|---------|------|
| OMC | [[Omnicom]] | -11.2% |
| PUBP.PA | [[Publicis]] | -9% |
| SNAP | [[Snap]] | -8.4% |
| PINS | [[Pinterest]] | -5.6% |

Day 2 (Feb 4): Selloff continues. Software stocks remain under pressure.

[[Jensen Huang]] response (Feb 4, [[Cisco]] event): Called AI replacing software "the most illogical thing in the world." Software is a tool AI will use, not replace — "Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?" Said [[NVIDIA]] itself adopted AI tools → freed employees to focus on chip design, not headcount cuts.

*Source: Bloomberg (Ian King), Feb 4 2026*

JPMorgan (Toby Ogg): "The sector isn't just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial."

Jefferies (Jeffrey Favuzza): Trading is "very much 'get me out' style selling."

Schroders: "Investors are aggressively repricing these areas as the historical 'visibility premium' erodes."

New tracking: [[AI workflow disruption basket]] (AIWD) created to track this correlation cluster.

## OpenAI-Nvidia Tension

[[Reuters]] exclusive: [[OpenAI]] dissatisfied with [[NVIDIA]] inference chips for [[Codex]] and agent workloads. Seeking alternatives (AMD, Cerebras). $100B investment delayed.
