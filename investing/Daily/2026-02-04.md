## Software Stocks Collapse — Claude Cowork Catalyst

**The trigger:** [[Anthropic]] launched **Claude Cowork** plug-ins on Friday — automates tasks across legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis. Not "Claude Code" — this is agent-based workflow automation.

**Valuation compression:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Software forward P/E | 33.1x | 23.2x | **-30%** |

## Earnings — Feb 3 After Close

### [[AMD]] — Beat but Guidance Kills

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Q4 Revenue | **$10.3B** | $9.6B |
| Q4 EPS | **$1.53** | $1.32 |
| Q1 Guidance | $9.8B ± $300M | — |

**Stock: -9% premarket** on soft Q1 outlook.

**Key detail:** $390M from non-recurring China GPU sales inflated the beat. Without China: much closer to consensus.

**Analyst reaction:** Largely neutral despite beat — concerns about profitability trajectory.

### [[Super Micro Computer|SMCI]] — Massive Beat

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Q2 Revenue | **$12.68B** | $10.3-10.4B |
| YoY Growth | **+123%** | +82% |
| Q3 Guidance | $12.3B | — |
| Q3 EPS Guidance | $0.60 | $0.51 |

**Stock soaring.** Record revenue despite margin pressure.

### [[DaVita]] — +22%

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Q4 Revenue | $3.62B | $3.51B |
| Q4 Adj EPS | $3.40 | ~$3.19 |
| YoY Revenue | +9.9% | — |

Beat + strong 2026 guidance. Stable treatment volumes, higher reimbursement rates.

| KKR | [[KKR]] | -10%+ |
| APO | [[Apollo Global]] | -7% |

Private credit portfolios hold significant software company debt → credit risk repricing.

## OpenAI-Nvidia Tension
