## Market overview

| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,885 | -0.87% |
| Nasdaq | 22,800 | -1.52% |
| Dow | 49,350 | -0.27% |
| 10Y Treasury | Lowest since Nov | Rally |
| Crude oil inventories | +16M bbl | Largest weekly build of 2026 |

Tech led lower on NVIDIA disappointment trade — strong earnings, underwhelming reception. Treasuries rallied (10Y yield at lowest since November). Massive crude build (+16M bbl) with refinery utilization dropping 2.4 ppts.

---

## NVIDIA -5.5% — best earnings, worst reception

[[NVIDIA]] fell **-5.5%** to $184.89 on its first full trading day after Q4 FY2026 results (covered in [[2026-02-25|yesterday's daily]]). Worst single-day drop since April 16. Despite:
- $68.1B revenue (+73% Y/Y), beating by $1.9B
- Q1 FY27 guide $78B, beating consensus $72.6B by 7.4%
- Vera Rubin samples shipped, supply commitments $95.2B

The market sold the news. Analysts cited "AI bubble" fears, deceleration anxiety (73% growth still means the base gets harder), and Blackwell gross margin dilution path. **Jensen Huang** at post-earnings: "not the end of the world" re: Pentagon-Anthropic dispute — a notable public comment from the biggest supplier to both sides.

63 analysts: 60 Buy, 2 Hold, 1 Sell. Consensus PT $261.54 — implies 42% upside from today's close.

## WBD board deems Paramount bid "Superior" — Netflix walks away

**Resolution to the biggest media M&A story of Q1 2026.** [[Warner Bros Discovery]] board officially declared [[Paramount Global|Paramount Skydance]]'s $31/share all-cash offer a "Superior Proposal" to [[Netflix]]'s $27.75/share bid. Netflix immediately withdrew — will not submit a higher offer.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Paramount offer | **$31/share all-cash** for all of WBD |
| Deal value | ~$77B enterprise value |
| Netflix offer (withdrawn) | $27.75/share for studios + HBO only |
| Netflix breakup fee | $2.8B owed to Netflix by WBD |
| Shareholder vote | **March 20** |
| Next step | Paramount and WBD must agree detailed terms |

**Key differences:** Paramount is buying the *entire* company (including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery networks). Netflix was buying studios + HBO only, with Discovery Global spinning off separately.

**Netflix response:** Sarandos had signaled discipline throughout — "willing to walk away and let someone else overpay." Netflix shares rose on the news — market reads this as Netflix dodging an overpriced acquisition.

**Paramount (PSKY)** traded at $11.16. Stock has been pressured — see Q4 miss below.

See: [[Warner Bros Discovery]], [[Netflix]], [[Paramount Global]], [[Skydance Media]]

## Paramount Skydance Q4 — miss and weak guidance

[[Paramount Global|Paramount Skydance]] (PSKY) reported Q4 on the same day it won the WBD bid:

| Metric | Q4 | vs Est |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Adj EPS | **-$0.12** | Miss (est. -$0.01) |
| Stock | $11.16 | 12-month range $9.95 - $20.86 |

Weak guidance compounds the earnings miss. Market questioning whether Paramount can absorb a $77B acquisition while its own operations underperform. The [[Larry Ellison]] $40B personal equity guarantee remains the financial backstop.

## IDC: smartphone market to shrink 13% on memory crisis

[[IDC]] projects global smartphone shipments will contract **12.9% in 2026** — the worst decline ever — due to the memory chip shortage. This is the strongest data point yet for the [[Memory squeeze thesis]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2026 shipments (forecast) | ~1.1B units |
| 2025 shipments | 1.26B |
| Decline | **-12.9%** (worst ever) |
| Smartphone ASP | **+14% to $523** (record) |
| RAM price stabilization | Mid-2027 (IDC estimate) |
| Root cause | HBM demand for AI draining LPDDR5X wafer capacity |

**Mechanism:** Every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an [[NVIDIA]] GPU is a wafer denied to a mid-range smartphone's LPDDR5X module. [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], and [[Micron]] won't revert — hyperscaler 3-year contracts are more attractive than consumer spot pricing.

**Winners:** [[Apple]] and Samsung (premium positioning, stronger balance sheets, first claim on supply). **Losers:** Low/mid-range OEMs — some reportedly sourcing memory chips from used handsets.

IDC: "a crisis like no other."

## Teleperformance FY2025 — "the dog that didn't bark" (yet)

[[Teleperformance]] reported FY2025 results. The much-anticipated earnings from the poster child of AI disruption landed with a whimper, not a bang:

| Metric | FY2025 | Y/Y |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Revenue | €10.21B | -0.7% |
| Like-for-like growth | +1.3% | (ex hyperinflation) |
| Adj EBITA | €1.49B | -3.4% |
| Net profit (group share) | €497M | — |
| Adjusted net profit | €781M | — |

### FY2026 guidance

| Metric | Guide | vs Est |
|--------|-------|--------|
| LFL sales growth | 0% to +2% | Est. +1.65% |
| Adj EBITA margin | **14.6%** | Beat (est. 14.3%) |
| Net free cash flow | €800-850M | Miss (est. €918M) |
| Dividend | **€4.50** (+7%) | — |

### CEO succession

**Daniel Julien exits.** Board appointed **Jorge Amar** as CEO effective March 15, 2026. Founder/CEO Julien, Deputy CEO Thomas Mackenbrock, and Deputy CEO/CFO Olivier Rigaudy all step down the same day. Clean sweep of top leadership.

**Analysis:** Revenue decline is real but modest (-0.7%). The AI disruption thesis predicted faster collapse. Margin guidance beat (14.6% vs 14.3%) suggests cost management is working. But FCF guide miss (€800-850M vs €918M est.) and the full C-suite change signal internal uncertainty. The stock at ~€60 (~85% below ATH) already prices severe disruption — the question is whether this report extends the "slowly then suddenly" timeline or validates the "value trap" camp.

## Anthropic-Pentagon: "virtually no progress" — DPA off the table, termination on

**Update to [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026]].** Three developments on Feb 26:

1. **Anthropic rejects Pentagon's "final offer":** CEO [[Dario Amodei]] said contract language received from Pentagon made "virtually no progress" on preventing Claude's use for mass surveillance of Americans or fully autonomous weapons. The company will not accept.

2. **Pentagon retreats from DPA:** Chief spokesperson Sean Parnell walked back the [[Defense Production Act]] threat. New language: "we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk" — DPA invocation no longer explicitly threatened. The legal uncertainty of applying the DPA to AI usage policies likely spooked Pentagon lawyers.

3. **Jensen weighs in:** [[NVIDIA]] CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC the rift is "not the end of the world" — notable given NVIDIA's $10B investment in Anthropic and massive Pentagon supply relationship. Huang positioned as neutral broker.

**Friday 5:01 PM deadline still stands.** Two paths: Anthropic complies (unlikely given today's statement) or gets terminated + supply-chain risk designation. The DPA escalation appears off the table — a meaningful de-escalation even as the core dispute remains unresolved.

## Dell Q4 FY2026 — AI infrastructure proxy delivers

[[Dell]] reported after the close. **AI server demand is real and accelerating.**

| Metric | Q4 FY26 | Y/Y | vs Est |
|--------|---------|-----|--------|
| Revenue | **$33.4B** | +39% | Beat ($31.4B est.) |
| Non-GAAP EPS | **$3.89** | — | Beat ($3.53 est.) |
| ISG (servers/storage) | $19.6B | +73% | — |
| CSG (PCs) | $13.5B | +14% | — |
| AI server shipments (Q4) | $9.4B | — | — |

### Full year FY2026 + guidance

| Metric | FY26 | FY27 Guide |
|--------|------|------------|
| Revenue | **$113.5B** | **$138-142B** (+22-25%) |
| AI server shipments | $25B (+150% Y/Y) | ~$50B projected |
| AI backlog | **$43B** | — |
| Operating cash flow | $11.2B | — |
| Shareholder returns | $7.5B | — |
| New buyback authorization | — | $10B |
| Dividend increase | — | +20% |

**The signal:** Dell is the clearest read-through on enterprise AI infrastructure spending. $43B AI backlog + $50B projected AI server revenue for FY27 confirms the NVIDIA narrative — hyperscaler + enterprise AI demand is accelerating, not plateauing. The ISG segment (+73%) is the star; CSG (+14%) shows the PC cycle is recovering but not booming (memory shortage headwinds per IDC above).

## Lagarde/ECB: AI boosting productivity, no layoff wave yet

[[ECB]] President [[Christine Lagarde]] told the European Parliament (Feb 26) that AI is boosting eurozone productivity but has **not yet triggered a wave of layoffs.**

Key quotes:
- "What we are seeing for the moment is that it's increasing productivity"
- "We are not yet seeing consequences in terms of labour market and waves of redundancies that are feared"
- ECB will be "extremely attentive going forward"

**Context:** This is the first major central bank statement on AI employment effects since the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] wiped >$1T from software/services stocks. Lagarde's "not yet" framing echoes the [[Citadel Securities 2026 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citadel Securities]] argument (Fed data shows flat AI adoption at work, SW eng jobs +11% Y/Y) against the [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citrini]] displacement scenario.

The macro data and the market data are telling opposite stories: employment is stable, but stocks are pricing in displacement. Someone is wrong.

## Bloomberg: "Claude Code and the Great Productivity Panic of 2026"

Bloomberg Businessweek (Issie Lapowsky, Feb 26) profiles the cultural shift AI coding agents have created. Key findings:

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Working hours | UC Berkeley study of 200-person org: people offloading work to AI agents but **simultaneously working longer hours** |
| Monitoring | Companies tracking engineers' "interactions per day" with coding agents |
| C-suite gap | 40%+ of C-suite say AI saves 8+ hrs/week; 67% of non-managers say <2 hrs (Section survey) |
| Intuit productivity | Engineers **30% more productive** (velocity of code shipped) |
| "Task expansion" | Berkeley researchers: non-technical staff vibe-coding creates *more* work for engineers who must clean up |
| "Busyware" risk | Abundance of low-value code — minor updates, dashboards for one, half-baked demos that engineers must make real |

**Named companies:**
- **[[Intuit]]** — CTO Alex Balazs "up at 5 AM writing code" with agents, product managers vibe-coding QuickBooks features, roles becoming "hybrid"
- **Arcade.dev** — CEO Alex Salazar calls out engineers for not spending enough on Claude Code; bills shot up 10x after "come to Jesus" meeting
- **DocuSketch** — VP Andrew Wirick monitors "interactions per day," Claude Code publishes weekly efficiency reports per engineer
- **[[OpenAI]]** — Greg Brockman: "feels like such a wasted opportunity every moment your agents aren't running"

**The Anthropic angle:** [[Claude Code]] specifically named alongside [[OpenAI]] Codex. The article captures the paradox at the heart of the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]]: AI agents are making workers *more* productive but also more anxious, more surveilled, and more overworked. The "vibe coding" promise of leisure has become a mandate to accelerate.

## Axelera AI: $250M round, largest EU AI chip investment

[[Axelera AI]] raised **$250M+** (Feb 24), the largest investment ever in a European AI semiconductor company. Total funding now $450M+ since 2021.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round size | $250M+ |
| Lead | Innovation Industries |
| New investors | [[BlackRock]], SiteGround Capital |
| Existing investors | Bitfury, Samsung Catalyst Fund, EU Innovation Council, CDP Venture Capital |
| Total raised | $450M+ (equity + grants + venture debt) |
| Customers | 500+ |
| Use of funds | Manufacturing of Europa chip (launching before June), software development |

**Europa chip:** 629 TOPS at ~3x perf/watt vs competitors. Edge-first architecture — inference at the edge, not data center. Sidesteps the NVIDIA data center moat entirely by targeting on-device AI.

**European sovereignty angle:** This is the EU's best bet for an indigenous AI chip company. The funding reflects the [[Sovereign AI race]] — European policymakers increasingly uncomfortable with total dependence on US (NVIDIA, AMD) and Taiwan ([[TSMC]]) for AI compute.

## Ratepayer Protection Pledge — White House formalizes March 4

Trump announced during the SOTU that Big Tech companies will sign a **Ratepayer Protection Pledge** at the White House on March 4. The pledge: tech companies building AI data centers must "provide for their own power needs" to prevent consumer electricity price increases.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Signing date | March 4, 2026 |
| Key demand | Tech companies build/buy own power for data centers |
| Context | National avg electricity price up **6%+ in past year**, partly from AI data center load |
| Enforcement | None — voluntary pledge |
| Critics | Common Dreams: "theatrical stunt," unenforceable |
| Bull case | Most hyperscalers already planning self-generation; pledge is political cover |

**TechCrunch:** "Most have already said they would" — the pledge formalizes commitments already made. But the political optics matter: Trump positioning himself as protecting consumers from AI infrastructure costs. [[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]], and nuclear/power names remain beneficiaries.

## Zscaler Q2 FY2026 — beat on everything, stock -10% AH

[[Zscaler]] reported Q2 FY2026 after the close. Beat on revenue, EPS, and raised guidance — stock still fell ~10% in after-hours. The SaaSpocalypse premium applies.

| Metric | Q2 FY26 | Y/Y |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | **$815.8M** | +26% |
| Non-GAAP EPS | **$1.01** | Beat ($0.89 est., +13.5%) |
| ARR | $3,359M | +25% |
| Net new ARR | $155.5M | — |
| Non-GAAP op margin | >22% | — |
| AI Security ARR | $400M+ target hit 3 quarters early | +80% Y/Y |

**FY2026 guidance raised:**
- ARR growth raised to 24%
- Non-GAAP income from operations: $742-748M (28-29% growth, up from $732-740M)

**Why it fell:** Despite the beat, billings and deferred revenue metrics fell short of elevated expectations. In the current environment ([[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]]), cybersecurity SaaS stocks get no benefit of the doubt — Zscaler is -37% YTD despite accelerating fundamentals. The AI Security pivot ($400M ARR, 3 quarters early) is the bright spot, but the market is asking whether zero trust becomes commoditized by AI agents.

## Nubank -9.5% despite Q4 beat

[[Nubank]] (NU) fell **-9.55%** to $15.06 on Feb 26 despite strong Q4 results (reported Feb 25 AH):

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Y/Y |
|--------|---------|-----|
| EPS | $0.19 | Beat ($0.18 est.) |
| Revenue | $4.86B | Beat ($4.55B est.) |
| Net income | $895M | +50% |
| ROE | 33% | — |
| Customers | 131M | — |

**Why it fell:** Cost structure concerns, rising credit risk, and BRL depreciation. Trading volume 216% above 3-month average — institutional rotation, not retail panic. The stock trades on Brazil macro, not US fintech sentiment — Nubank is a LatAm story dressed in NYSE clothing.

See: [[Nubank]]

## Other major movers (vault actors)

| Actor | Move | Catalyst |
|-------|------|----------|
| [[Penn Entertainment]] | **+13%** | Q4 revenue beat |
| [[Vital Farms]] | **-19%** | Earnings miss, FY26 guide cut to $900-920M (from $930-950M) |
| [[Walker & Dunlop]] | **-20%** | FY guide $4.50-5.00 EPS vs $5.43 est. |
