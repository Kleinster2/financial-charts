## Anta Sports Takes 29% Stake in Puma

[[Anta Sports]] is acquiring a **29% stake in [[Puma]]**, becoming its largest shareholder and displacing the Pinault family's Artémis.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | 29% |
| Previous largest | Artémis (Pinault family) ~29% |
| Strategic rationale | Anta brings China expertise; Puma gets turnaround help |

**Context:**
- Puma's China sales dropped **>20% between 2023-2025** (per Nomura)
- Weak online channels, slow store updates, over-reliance on few retail partners
- [[Nike]] admits its China turnaround is "behind schedule" — becoming a "lifestyle brand competing on price"
- [[Adidas]] now designs >50% of China clothes locally

**Anta's position:**
- $10B revenue vs Nike's $46B
- 17% 5-year CAGR vs Nike's 4%
- 450% total return over decade vs Nike's 19%
- Also owns [[Jack Wolfskin]], [[Fila]] (China license)

**The play:** Anta wants to go global while using local China expertise to turn around Western brands. A successful Puma China revival would validate the model.

Asia Pacific is ~20% of Puma sales — recovery still depends mostly on Europe/US execution.
