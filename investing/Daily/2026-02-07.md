## Anta Sports Takes 29% Stake in Puma

[[Anta Sports]] is acquiring a 29% stake in [[Puma]], becoming its largest shareholder and displacing the Pinault family's Artémis.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | 29% |
| Previous largest | Artémis (Pinault family) ~29% |
| Strategic rationale | Anta brings China expertise; Puma gets turnaround help |

Context:
- Puma's China sales dropped >20% between 2023-2025 (per Nomura)
- Weak online channels, slow store updates, over-reliance on few retail partners
- [[Nike]] admits its China turnaround is "behind schedule" — becoming a "lifestyle brand competing on price"
- [[Adidas]] now designs >50% of China clothes locally

Anta's position:
- $10B revenue vs Nike's $46B
- 17% 5-year CAGR vs Nike's 4%
- 450% total return over decade vs Nike's 19%
- Also owns [[Jack Wolfskin]], [[Fila]] (China license)

The play: Anta wants to go global while using local China expertise to turn around Western brands. A successful Puma China revival would validate the model.

Asia Pacific is ~20% of Puma sales — recovery still depends mostly on Europe/US execution.

## AI Capex Hitting Credit Markets — Bloomberg Credit Weekly

Bloomberg's Credit Weekly (Feb 7) details how AI spending is creating stress across credit markets:

|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| [[Google]] | $185B | 55% above expectations |

### Software debt selloff

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Software leveraged loan prices | -4% YTD |
| BDC equity index | -4.6% (week of Feb 3) |
| BDC avg software exposure | >20% of portfolios (Barclays) |
| Private credit defaults if aggressive AI disruption | Up to 13% (UBS) |
| Deutsche Bank failed loan sale | ~$1.2B (software acquisition) |

PE firms questioning whether SaaS debt-fueled buyout model is viable. Two European software companies shelved loan offerings.

### Notable bond deals

| Issuer | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Oracle]] | $25B | Single-day sale (Feb 3) |
| Cipher Mining (for [[Amazon]] DC) | $2B | Junk bonds |
| Stonepeak (BP Castrol) | $3.75B | May include junk tranche |
| Bank of America | $7B | IG multi-tranche |

## India Partially Opens Agriculture Sector to Secure US Deal

[[India]] secured an interim tariff reduction from 50% to 18% by partially opening its ~$580B agriculture sector to US imports.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tariff (old → new) | 50% → 18% (interim deal) |
| Agriculture sector | ~$580B (McKinsey) |
| Products opened | DDGS, red sorghum, soybean oil, tree nuts, fruit |
| Products excluded | Dairy, poultry, raw soybeans, GM food crops |

Key nuance: DDGS is a GM corn byproduct allowed as animal feed — India technically maintains its GM food crop ban while making a significant concession. Farmer lobby risk for Modi given rural political sensitivity.
