## Bloomberg Wall Street Week — Japan special (Feb 20, 2026)

Full episode from Tokyo. [[Apollo]] convened 200 partners in Japan. Key signal: private capital is moving into [[Japan]] at scale, and the macro story (reflation, governance reform, political stability) is attracting long-term institutional commitment.

### Key takeaways

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Household savings rotation** | ¥2,000T (~$13T+) in financial assets. Cash share fell from ~55% (2022) to ~50% (2024). Equity exposure up to 14%. Just beginning |
| **Delistings surge** | ~50/year → 125 (2025) → 16 announced in early 2026. Companies questioning whether listing is best path |
| **Carve-out revolution** | 280 carve-outs/spin-offs in H1 2025, ¥35T deal volume. [[Panasonic Automotive]] to [[Apollo]] is flagship |
| **Private credit gap** | Corporate bond market only ¥60T. Banks face capital constraints. Apollo positioning as supplement |
| **Takaichi fiscal risk** | Spending more + potentially taxing less. Bond markets nervous. "Voters gave mandate, markets have not" (Solís) |
| **Culture shift** | 1 in 3 new grads planning to leave first company. Startups now most popular career choice |
| **Sony transformation** | Entertainment 30% → 60% of revenue. Gaming (largest), music (Apollo-financed catalogs), film/anime |
| **Rowan tail risk** | Normal: 95% of outcomes between sidelines. Now: 70-75%. Geopolitics, deficits, rate volatility |

### Featured speakers

- [[Marc Rowan]] ([[Apollo]] CEO) — "new swagger" in Japan, private credit thesis, 70-75% sideline framing

- [[Masashi Nagayasu]] ([[Panasonic Automotive]] CEO) — carveout discipline, triple E-C by 2027
