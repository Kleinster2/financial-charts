## Markets

*Wednesday — markets closed. NFP delayed from Feb 6 (government shutdown) released today.*

| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Dow | 50,121 | -0.13% |
| S&P 500 | 6,941 | flat |
| Nasdaq | 23,066 | -0.16% |
| 10Y yield | 4.15% | -6bps |
| DXY | 96.5 | -0.12% |
| Gold | $5,088 | +1.25% |
| Bitcoin | ~$67,300 | -2.5% |
| VIX | 17.95 | +3.4% |

Strong NFP (+130K vs +70K est) faded on massive 2025 benchmark revisions (-403K). AI infra stocks rallied ([[Vertiv]] +24%, [[Caterpillar]], [[GE Vernova]], [[Eaton]] up). Software selloff continued — [[Salesforce]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Intuit]] all -5%+. Gold hit new highs above $5,000. Bitcoin hovering near $67K, down from $126K ATH in Oct.

## NFP January 2026 — strong headline, devastating revisions

The delayed January jobs report upended the labor market narrative:

| Metric | Value | vs Estimate |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Nonfarm payrolls | +130K | +70K est (beat) |
| Unemployment rate | 4.4% | 4.5% prior (improved) |
| December revised | +48K | Down from +50K |
| 2025 benchmark revision | -403K | Avg monthly gains: 49K → 15K |

The headline beat masks a much weaker underlying story. The BLS annual benchmark revisions slashed 2025 job growth from +584K to +181K — average monthly gains of just 15K, well below the previously reported 49K. This is one of the largest downward revisions in modern history.

Sector detail:
- Healthcare: +82K (ambulatory +50K)
- Social assistance: +42K
- Construction: +33K
- Manufacturing: +5K
- Federal government: -34K (deferred resignation program)
- Financial activities: -22K

Fed implications: Dallas Fed's [[Lorie Logan]] said Tuesday rates may not need further adjustment. But the benchmark revisions — revealing a labor market far weaker than understood — increase pressure for a March rate cut. Money markets raised April cut odds after the data.

Technical changes: BLS revised birth-death model to incorporate current sample information monthly. Establishment data revised back to Apr 2024 (NSA) and Jan 2021 (SA).

## Shopify (SHOP) Q4 2025 — revenue +31%, agentic commerce

[[Shopify]] beat across the board and announced a $2B buyback:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY change |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Revenue | $3.67B | +30.6% |
| GMV | $123.8B | +31.0% |
| GAAP EPS | $0.57 | Beat $0.43 est (+33.9%) |
| Adj EBITDA | $753M | Beat by 6.2% |
| Adj EBITDA margin | 20.5% | — |
| Operating margin | 17.2% | Flat YoY |
| FCF margin | 19.5% | Up from 17.8% QoQ |

Full year 2025: $11.6B revenue, $2B free cash flow, 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit FCF margins.

$2B share repurchase program authorized, effective Feb 17, 2026. No fixed expiration.

Agentic commerce: In December, Shopify launched Agentic Storefronts — helping brands be discovered on AI platforms ([[OpenAI|ChatGPT]], [[Perplexity]], [[Microsoft]] Copilot). This positions Shopify as the commerce layer for AI-driven shopping, where AI agents discover and transact on behalf of users.

Q1 2026 guidance: FCF margin in the low-to-mid teens (below Q1 2025), suggesting reinvestment.

Average analyst target: $179 vs ~$121 share price — significant upside implied.

## Dealogic/Mergermarket bonds hit by AI fears — disintermediation spreads to financial data

The [[AI disintermediation]] thesis claimed another victim. [[ION Group]]'s bonds — parent of financial data providers [[Dealogic]] and [[Mergermarket]] — sold off on fears that AI tools can replicate their deal intelligence and M&A data products.

This extends the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] pattern directly into financial data infrastructure. Dealogic provides deal league tables, origination data, and analytics to the top 50 investment banks. Mergermarket provides predictive M&A intelligence. Both are information intermediaries — exactly the business model AI disintermediation targets.

Connection to existing thesis: [[Thomson Reuters]] (-20%), [[RELX]] (-14%), [[FactSet]], [[Morningstar]] were equity victims in Week 1. Now the credit market is catching up — ION Group's leveraged debt structure makes it particularly vulnerable if revenue comes under pressure.

ION Group (Andrea Pignataro, founder) was already restructuring — combining Dealogic and Mergermarket under ION Analytics, refinancing expensive private debt with cheaper syndicated loans. The AI narrative complicates that refinancing.

## Dassault Systèmes (DSY.PA) crashes 18% — SaaSpocalypse's biggest European victim

[[Dassault Systèmes]] reported weak Q4 earnings and guided 2026 below expectations, triggering the worst single-day drop in company history. Trading was briefly suspended at the Paris open. ~€6B in market cap wiped out. UBS simultaneously downgraded the broader enterprise IT sector.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY2025 |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total revenue | €1,681M (+1% cc) | €6,236M (+4% cc) |
| Software revenue | €1,522M (-5% reported) | €5,638M |
| Recurring revenue | +3% | +6% |
| Subscription revenue | +4% | +11% |
| Cloud revenue | +9% | +8% |
| Non-IFRS op margin | 37.0% (+90bps cc) | 32.0% (+40bps) |
| Non-IFRS EPS | €0.40 (+9%) | €1.31 (+7%) |
| IFRS EPS | — | €0.90 (flat) |
| Cash from ops | — | €1.63B |

Segment detail:

| Division | Q4 2025 | Share | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| Industrial Innovation | +4% | 58% of software rev | Main growth engine. Transport & Mobility, High-Tech, Industrial Equipment driving |
| Life Sciences (Medidata) | -4% | 17% | Clinical trial headwinds — lower study volume |
| Mainstream Innovation (SOLIDWORKS) | +1% | 25% | SOLIDWORKS solid, CENTRIC PLM impacted by Cloud transition |

3DEXPERIENCE platform -3% in Q4 (strong comparison base + weak European auto). Cloud +9%.

2026 guidance missed: Revenue growth 3–5% (Street expected 5-7%), margin expansion 40-80bps, EPS +3-6%. Company introducing ARR reporting in 2026 to signal subscription transition.

CEO Pascal Daloz: company is "building new levers of growth and profitability by introducing unique Industrial AI offerings." Analyst presentation Feb 12-13.

Why it matters: This is the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis crossing the Atlantic. Dassault makes CAD/PLM/simulation software (CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, 3DEXPERIENCE). JPMorgan called results "worse than even the most negative had feared." The weak Q4 + soft guide played directly into the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative — software middlemen getting repriced.

Stock down >50% over 12 months. This isn't just an AI fear selloff — it's a growth deceleration dressed in AI panic.

![[dasty-price-chart.png]]
*DASTY $53→$21 since early 2024. The cliff on the right is today. Down >50% in 12 months — the SaaSpocalypse's biggest European casualty.*

## St. James's Place (STJ.L) hit by AI wealth management fears — down 16% from peak

[[St. James's Place]] — the UK's largest wealth manager — sold off on AI disruption fears, extending the [[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]] pattern to European markets. Stock hit 1,300p (lowest since Dec 15), down 16% from YTD high of 1,575p.

Not just SJP — the selloff rippled across UK wealth managers: [[Schroders]], [[Aberdeen]], [[M&G]], and [[Quilter]] all fell sharply.

Irony: SJP's actual business is strong. FY2025 new business inflows £21.9B (+19% YoY), net inflows £6.2B (+42% YoY), FUM £220B (record, +16%), retention 94.9%. Profit £805M (up from £577M). Earnings due Feb 25.

But the narrative overrides fundamentals. SJP's model — face-to-face advisers charging advisory fees — is exactly the model [[AI disintermediation]] targets. [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI ($60/seat/month tax planning) is a direct competitor to what SJP's 5,000+ advisers do manually.

US mirrors: [[Raymond James]] -8.8% (worst since Mar 2020), [[Charles Schwab]] -7.4%, [[LPL Financial]] -8.3%. Schwab CEO Rick Wurster went on Bloomberg to address the selloff.

Raymond James analyst called the fears "completely overblown." SJP's UK regulatory moat (FCA-licensed advisers) + relationship complexity gives it more protection than US wealth managers.

Analyst consensus: 9 Buy, 0 Sell. +5.8% implied upside to target.

## TSMC record January sales — AI demand unrelenting

[[TSMC]] reported record monthly revenue for January 2026:

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| January revenue | NT$401.3B (~$12.7B) | +37% YoY, +20% MoM |
| Previous record | Broken — highest monthly sales ever | — |

This follows the Q4 2025 blowout (revenue $33.7B, gross margin 62.3%, net margin 48.3% — all records). 2026 capex guided $52–56B (+40% YoY at high end).

A16 "Angstrom Era": TSMC's 1.6nm-class A16 process — mass production late 2026 — introduces backside power delivery, a radical re-architecting of how power reaches transistors. First confirmed partner: [[NVIDIA]] Feynman GPU architecture. The semiconductor industry has crossed from nanometer to sub-nanometer scale.

What it signals for NVIDIA: [[NVIDIA]] holds 92% of the data center GPU market (IoT Analytics). TSMC's record January sales provide the clearest signal yet that AI chip demand is accelerating, not plateauing. NVIDIA is poised to overtake [[Apple]] as TSMC's largest customer in 2026.

Analyst consensus: 94% of 63 analysts rate NVIDIA buy/strong buy. Avg target $254 (+33% upside). Evercore ISI top pick with $352 target (+85% upside).

## China AI IPO surge — Shanghai Biren, Baidu chip unit, MiniMax, Zhipu

China's AI sector is on fire in Hong Kong:

| Company | Event | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[Shanghai Biren]] | HK IPO | +120% on debut, retail subscription 2,300x oversubscribed |
| [[Baidu]] AI chip unit | Confidential HK filing | Spinning out AI chip division |
| [[MiniMax]] | IPO expected | Fast-growing AI startup |
| [[Zhipu]] | IPO expected | Major Chinese AI lab |

Context: Chinese AI and chip stocks have surged since [[DeepSeek]]-R1's breakout in early 2025. US chip restrictions have forced Chinese developers to innovate — and the results are cost-efficient, open-source models from [[Alibaba]] (Qwen), [[Moonshot AI]], MiniMax, and Zhipu.

But the gap persists. At a landmark Beijing meeting in January, Alibaba's Qwen technical lead Justin Lin gave a blunt assessment: the probability of a Chinese AI firm overtaking US frontrunners in 3-5 years is "below 20 percent."

Beijing has made AI application a national priority — action plan released in January for AI in manufacturing across 14 industries including steel, petrochemicals, NEVs, robotics, and medical equipment.

## Israel-US AI hub with SMR nuclear power

[[Israel]] and the [[United States]] have reached understandings on a major AI technology park in southern Israel, powered by nuclear energy:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Southern Israel (Negev) |
| Framework | Strategic AI cooperation agreement (signed Jan 2026) |
| Power source | Small modular reactors (SMRs), 50–300 MWe |
| MOU language | "High-intensity energy infrastructure" |

The official MOU remains vague, but analysts believe the reference to "high-intensity energy infrastructure" clearly points to SMRs. This would be Israel's first nuclear power capability, addressing the massive power demands of AI data centers.

Broader nuclear-AI convergence: Joins [[Meta]]'s 6.6GW nuclear agreements with [[Vistra]], [[TerraPower]], [[Oklo]], and [[Constellation Energy]]. [[Constellation Energy]]'s Three Mile Island restart for [[Microsoft]] expected 2027. Nuclear is rapidly moving from fringe to mainstream for AI power.

## Retired Navy reactors for AI data centers — HGP proposal

[[HGP Intelligent Energy]], a Texas-based firm, has proposed repurposing two retired US Navy nuclear reactors for an AI data center project:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Company | HGP Intelligent Energy (Texas) |
| Proposal | Repurpose 2 retired Navy nuclear reactors |
| Location | Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee |
| Capacity | 450–520 MW |
| Framework | Trump's Genesis Mission |
| Status | DOE loan guarantee requested |

If approved, this would be the first time a military reactor has been repurposed for civilian use.

The proposal comes under Trump's nuclear expansion push — four executive orders targeting US nuclear capacity from ~100 GW (2024) to 400 GW by 2050. The retired aircraft carrier/submarine reactors would deliver immediate capacity rather than waiting years for new construction.

Harvard Belfer Center published a paper on Feb 10 ("AI, Data Centers, and the U.S. Electric Grid: A Watershed Moment") highlighting Virginia's data center growth adding thousands of MW of nearly constant demand, compressing planning timelines.

## Siemens Energy (ENR.DE) Q1 FY2026 — record gas turbine orders, profit nearly triples

[[Siemens Energy]] reported blowout Q1 results, driven by AI data center power demand:

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Order backlog | €146B | Record |
| Gas turbines booked | 102 | Strongest quarter ever |
| Gas Services margin | 16.6% | Before special items |
| Grid Technologies margin | 17.6% | Orders +21.8% YoY |
| Gamesa operating loss | -€46M | Improved from -€374M YoY |

FY2026 guidance confirmed: 11-13% revenue growth (on €39.1B base), 9-11% profit margin, €3-4B net income, €4-5B FCF pre-tax.

Gas Services booked 102 turbines — 12 GW converted from reservations to firm orders, 12 GW new reservations. Regional mix: 40% US, 35% [[Europe]], 15% Middle East/[[China]]. CEO Bruch: reservations converting 1:1 into orders, pushing back on bubble fears.

Grid Technologies: US data-center orders in high triple-digit-million-euro range. [[Siemens]] Gamesa narrowing losses — plans to break even in FY2026.

Expansion: $1B+ US manufacturing investment (1,500 jobs), targeting [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] grid rebuilding (aiming for ~14 GW in Iraq).

Stock up ~10x in two years, market cap ~€137B. Deutsche Bank target €170, Jefferies €164, UBS reversed bearish stance to €175 (from €38).

## Base metals mania — copper record $14,500, tin $56,800, nickel +10%, LMEX at all-time high

The base metals complex has been on a historic run in early 2026, driven by Chinese speculative buying, supply disruptions, and AI/energy transition demand narratives:

| Metal | Recent high | Current | YTD / YoY |
|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| [[Copper]] | $14,500/t (record, Jan 29) | ~$13,050/t ($5.93/lb) | +26% YoY |
| [[Tin]] | $56,800/t (record, Jan 26) | ~$49,100/t | +57% YoY, +40% YTD before pullback |
| [[Nickel]] | $18,950/t (19-mo high, Jan 29) | ~$17,550/t | +13% YoY |
| Aluminum | Testing $3,100/t | ~$3,100/t | — |
| LMEX Index | Record (surpassed Mar 2022 peak) | Near highs | +7% YTD |

### Copper

Surged 11% in a single session — biggest move in 16+ years — as Chinese investors piled in. Hit $14,500/t before sharp retracement. Goldman estimates 600K ton surplus in 2025 but prices still hit records. [[China]]'s refined copper output growth slowing to ~5% in 2026 (half of 2025 pace). Citi holds $13,000/t avg forecast, flagging scrap supply response and demand destruction risk.

### Tin — structural deficit

The tightest fundamental story of the complex. BMI raised 2026 forecast to $35,000/t (well below current spot). Supply disruptions on all fronts:
- [[Indonesia]]: President Subianto ordered closure of 1,000 illegal tin mines in Sumatra. Refined tin exports -33% in 2024 to 46K tons.
- [[Myanmar]]: Man Maw mine (Wa State) — licenses issued but no verifiable export volumes.
- [[DRC]]: Bisie mine (Alphamin Resources) suspended operations.
- [[China]]: Resources depleted, smelters lack concentrates.

Tin has become an AI proxy — soldering demand for semiconductors and data centers. SHFE trading volume exceeded 1M tonnes in a single session (2x annual global physical usage), prompting Chinese authorities to warn against speculation.

Projected 13K-ton supply deficit by 2030. World Bank expects tin and copper to reach new nominal records.

### Nickel

Indonesia reaffirmed sharp quota cuts today — 260-270M tonnes, down ~30% from 379M in 2025 and below forecast 330M domestic consumption. Smelters may need to import or cut production. Vale Indonesia mine suspended. Despite this, structural oversupply persists — [[Nornickel]] projects 275K MT surplus, ING forecasts $15,250 avg.

### Chinese speculative wave

The common thread: Chinese investors riding momentum across the complex. Record SHFE volumes, algorithmic and retail participation, clear disconnect between financial positioning and physical demand. Goldman warns the rally faces headwinds from weak Chinese manufacturing demand. Physical buyers hesitating at current prices.

## BofA's Blanch: 2M bpd oil surplus, "electrons over molecules"

[[Francisco Blanch]] ([[Bank of America]] head of commodities) on Bloomberg today:

- Oil: ~2M bpd surplus in 2026. Brent avg $60 (from $68 in 2025). But floor from low inventories outside [[China]] and strategic reserve buying. Global consumption to 108M bpd by 2031 (from 104M in 2025).
- Natural gas: Neutral, $4/MMBtu Henry Hub.
- Electricity: Bullish — "electrons over molecules." AI commodity exposure via [[PJM]] market, expects it to trend higher.
- Gold: $4,000 target.
- Industrial metals: Bullish into 2026+.
- Geopolitical: Russia-[[Ukraine]] peace deal with sanctions relief would be "pretty bearish for commodity markets broadly."

The selloff was not beta — SPY was -2.6% over the same period, XLF -1.4%. Alt managers fell 5-17x the market. But they bounced back ~50% by Feb 10 as the market sorted originators/asset owners from advisory middlemen. On Feb 10 (wealth management catalyst), ALTM was flat while SCHW fell -7.4% and RJF -8.7%.

Key insight: [[Morgan Stanley]] fell only -2.4% on Feb 10 — diversification across IB/trading dilutes the wealth management hit. Excluded from [[AI financial disintermediation basket|AIFD]] for this reason.

## PE software talent drain — concept note created

Created [[PE software talent drain]] concept note documenting the structural inability of PE-owned tech companies to compete for talent against public tech. The problem is compensation mechanics: public RSUs (liquid, quarterly vesting, capital gains) vs PE phantom equity (illiquid, exit-dependent, ordinary income).

Body count: [[Cloud Software Group]] (Vista/Elliott, $16.5B — "all the talent has been laid off or quit"), [[Zendesk]] (H&F/Permira, $10.2B — all founders departed), [[Cloudera]] (KKR/CD&R — equity grants "an absolute joke"), [[Dell]] (Silver Lake — voluntary departures "exceeded expectations," drove return to public markets).

The AI accelerant makes this existential: AI specialists command $206K avg (56-67% premium), top packages >$1M at [[Meta]]/[[Google]]/[[OpenAI]]. PE-owned companies can't compete. The vicious cycle: can't hire AI talent → can't build AI capabilities → products commoditized (SaaSpocalypse) → more talent leaves.

$440B in PE software acquisitions (2015-2025) exposed. [[UBS]] estimates 25-35% of private credit market at AI disruption risk. Isaac Kim (ex-[[Elliott Management]]): "Technology private equity, in its current form, is dead."

Connects to ALTM: the deeper reason alt managers sold off in Wave 1 was not that they're intermediaries — it's that their portfolio companies are, and the talent drain is the transmission mechanism for product deterioration.

## TotalEnergies (TTE) FY 2025 — adj net income $15.6B, Google solar deal, Venezuela exit

[[TotalEnergies]] reported Q4 and full year 2025 results, plus a string of strategic moves:

### FY 2025 results

| Metric | FY 2025 | YoY change |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Adj net income | $15.6B | -15% |
| Adj net income/share | $6.89 | — |
| Cash flow (ex WC) | $27.8B | -7% |
| Net investments | $17.1B | — |
| ROACE | 12.6% | Best among majors (4th consecutive year) |
| Hydrocarbon production | 2,529 kboe/d | +4% |
| Dividend | €3.40/share | +5.6% |
| Share buybacks | $7.5B | 122.6M shares |
| Payout ratio | 55% | — |
| Gearing | 15% | — |

Segment detail:

| Segment | Adj NOI | YoY |
|---------|---------|-----|
| E&P | $8.4B | -16% |
| Integrated [[LNG]] | $4.1B | -16% |
| Integrated Power | $2.2B | +2% |
| Refining & Chemicals | $2.4B | +10% |
| Marketing & Services | $1.4B | +1% |

Oil price decline (-15% YoY) drove the earnings drop, but production ramp-ups from Mero-2/3/4 ([[Brazil]]), Anchor and Ballymore (US), Fenix ([[Argentina]]), and Tyra ([[Denmark]]) provided volume growth.

2026 guidance: production +3% (targeting >2.6 Mboe/d in Q1), capex ~$15B (~$3B for low-carbon), cash flow >$26B at $60/b Brent, electricity production >60 [[TWh]] (+~25%), buybacks $3-6B at $60-70/b oil.

### Google solar deal (Feb 9)

Signed two long-term PPAs to deliver 1 GW of solar capacity — 28 [[TWh]] over 15 years — to power [[Google]]'s data centers in [[Texas]]. Sites: Wichita (805 MWp) and Mustang Creek (195 MWp). Construction starts Q2 2026. Another data point in the hyperscaler-energy convergence.

### Venezuela: "too expensive and too polluting" (Feb 11)

CEO Patrick Pouyanné rejected calls from [[Donald Trump]] for Big Oil to invest in [[Venezuela]], calling it "too expensive and too polluting." TotalEnergies fully exited Venezuelan oil & gas in 2022. The heavy crude economics don't fit TotalEnergies' strategy. Shares hit a new 52-week high.

### Namibia expansion (Feb 6)

Acquired 42.5% operated stake in PEL 104 from Eight Offshore and Maravilla Oil & Gas, following December's 40% stake in [[Galp]]'s Mopane discovery. [[Namibia]] is Africa's hottest exploration frontier.

## Robinhood (HOOD) Q4 2025 — record year, but crypto slide tanks stock 7%

[[Robinhood]] posted a record year but Q4 revenue missed on crypto weakness. Stock fell ~7% after hours.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY | FY 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.28B | +27% | $4.5B | +52% |

| Transaction-based | $776M | +15% |
|   Options | $314M | +41% |
|   Crypto | $221M | -38% |
|   Equities | $94M | +54% |
|   Other (event contracts) | $147M | +300% |
| Net interest | $411M | +39% |
| Other | $96M | +109% |

Operating metrics:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Funded customers | 27.0M | +7% |

| Options contracts | 659M | +38% |
| Retirement AUC | $26.5B | +102% |
| Margin book | $16.8B | +113% |

The miss was crypto: $221M in Q4 vs. much higher earlier quarters as the late-2025 crypto slide crimped volumes. [[Prediction markets]] were a bright spot — event contracts hit 8.5B traded, on track for a billion-dollar annual business.

Strategic moves: UK [[stocks and shares ISA]] launched, short selling rolled out (billions in notional volume), [[Bitstamp]] acquisition expanding global crypto. New CFO Shiv Verma replaced Jason Warnick (Feb 6). Vlad Tenev: building the "Financial SuperApp."

2026 outlook: adj opex + SBC of $2.6-2.725B (+18% midpoint).

Analyst reaction: [[Barclays]] $124 PT (from $159, overweight), [[Goldman Sachs]] $130 (from $152, buy). Consensus remains bullish — crypto jitters seen as transitory.

## Inertia Enterprises — $450M Series A for laser fusion commercialization

[[Inertia Enterprises]], founded by [[Twilio]] co-founder [[Jeff Lawson]], raised a $450M Series A led by [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] with participation from [[GV]], [[IQT]], [[Threshold Ventures]], and others. The company is building commercial power plants based on inertial confinement fusion (ICF) — the only fusion approach that has achieved scientific breakeven ([[National Ignition Facility]], Dec 2022).

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round | $450M Series A |
| Lead | [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] |
| CEO | [[Jeff Lawson]] (ex-[[Twilio]]) |
| Chief Scientist | [[Annie Kritcher]] (NIF ignition lead) |
| CTO | [[Mike Dunne]] (Stanford/SLAC) |
| HQ | Livermore, CA |
| Target | GW-scale fusion power plant, construction ~2030 |

Technology: "Thunderwall" laser beamline — ~1,000 semiconductor diode lasers firing 10 pulses/sec on mass-manufactured targets (<$1 each, 4.5mm). NIF uses 192 lasers at ~1 shot/day on hand-crafted targets. The engineering leap from proven physics to commercial repetition rate is the core risk.

Lawson stepped down as [[Twilio]] CEO in Jan 2024 under activist pressure. Moving from SaaS to fusion is a dramatic pivot, but brings operator-scaling experience. Kritcher designed the Hybrid-E experiment that achieved net energy gain at NIF.

Competitive context: [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] ($2B+, tokamak), [[Helion Energy]] ($1B+, pulsed FRC), [[TAE Technologies]] ($1.2B+) — none have demonstrated breakeven. Inertia's ICF is the only approach operating in a proven physics regime.

Added to [[Long nuclear]] thesis evidence log (fusion row + evidence entry). [[Twilio]] note updated with Lawson departure link. Actor note created + stubs: [[Jeff Lawson]], [[Annie Kritcher]], [[Mike Dunne]], [[National Ignition Facility]], [[LLNL]], [[Zap Energy]], [[IQT]], [[Threshold Ventures]], [[Uncork Capital]].

## Mistral AI — €1.2B Sweden data center, $400M+ ARR, BNP Paribas 3-year deal

[[Mistral]] made three major announcements on the same day, signaling a shift from model lab to vertically integrated European AI infrastructure provider.

### Sweden data center (€1.2B)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | €1.2B ($1.4B) |
| Partner | [[EcoDataCenter]] (Borlänge, [[Sweden]]) |
| Capacity | 23 MW |
| GPUs | [[NVIDIA]] Vera Rubin (latest gen) |
| Operational | 2027 |
| Projected revenue | >€2B over 5 years |

This is Mistral's first infrastructure investment outside [[France]]. The facility will train models at night and serve enterprise inference during the day — vertical integration mirroring what US hyperscalers already do. [[Sweden]] chosen for clean energy access and low-carbon footprint.

CEO Arthur Mensch: "Europe has realized that its dependency on U.S. digital services was excessive."

### Revenue disclosure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ARR | >$400M |
| Prior year | ~$20M |
| Growth | ~20x |
| 2026 target | >$1B recurring |
| Revenue mix | ~60% Europe |
| Enterprise clients | 100+ |

Named clients include [[ASML]], [[TotalEnergies]], [[HSBC]], [[Stellantis]]. Government partnerships in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Greece]], and [[Estonia]].

Context: [[Anthropic]] reported ~$10B in 2025 revenue; [[OpenAI]] targeted ~$20B. Mistral's $400M ARR is ~25x smaller than [[OpenAI]] but growing 20x YoY — the fastest growth rate in the sector.

### BNP Paribas 3-year extension

[[BNP Paribas]] extended its Mistral partnership for three years, covering all business lines. The relationship began Sep 2023 with Global Markets, expanded group-wide Feb 2024, formalized in a multi-year deal Jul 2024, and now gets a full three-year extension.

~100 use cases deployed across the bank including 24/7 virtual customer assistant. BNP Paribas also participated in Mistral's fundraising rounds.

This is the largest European bank committing long-term to a European AI provider — a data sovereignty play. Mistral's on-premise deployment fits regulated finance better than US cloud-first competitors.

### IPO plans

Mensch said an IPO is not necessary in 2026 — debt financing available. But on the long-term radar. [[OpenAI]] and [[Anthropic]] both targeting 2026 IPOs.

## SMIC Q4 2025 — profit +61%, but warns AI data center capacity could sit idle

[[SMIC]] co-CEO Zhao Haijun sounded a rare overcapacity warning during the Q4 earnings call:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Revenue | $2.49B | +12.8% YoY, beat estimates |
| Net income | — | +60.7% YoY, beat |
| 2025 capex | $8.1B | +10.5% YoY |
| 2026 capex guidance | ~$8.1B | Flat YoY |
| New capacity 2026 | +40K 12" wafers/mo | After +50K in 2025 |

Zhao compared the current AI data center buildout to Chinese suburban data centers built in the early 2020s, "many of which have yet to find tenants." His warning: "Companies would love to build 10 years' worth of data center capacity within one or two years... what exactly these data centers will do, that has not been fully thought through."

Separate headwind: strong AI chip demand is squeezing memory supplies for smartphones and other consumer electronics. SMIC expects flat revenue as low-end order declines offset AI chip growth.

Context: [[Moody's]] estimates AI infrastructure spending could exceed $3T over 5 years. In 2026 alone, [[Alphabet]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]], and [[Microsoft]] capex expected to reach ~$650B. SMIC's warning is the first from a major foundry executive explicitly flagging utilization risk.

## Zhipu GLM-5 — 744B params, trained on Huawei chips, DeepSeek extends to 1M context

[[Zhipu]] launched GLM-5, its next-gen flagship model, competing directly with [[DeepSeek]]:

| Metric | GLM-5 | GLM-4.7 (prior) |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Parameters | 744B | 355B |
| Training data | 28.5T tokens | — |
| Architecture | DeepSeek Sparse Attention | — |
| License | Open-source (GitHub, Hugging Face) | — |

Zhipu claims GLM-5 achieves industry-leading scores for open models in coding and agentic tasks, surpassing [[Google]] DeepMind's Gemini 3 Pro on internal benchmarks. Still lags [[Claude]] on coding benchmarks.

Key milestone: Zhipu trained GLM-Image entirely on [[Huawei]] Ascend chips — first Chinese AI company to train a major model fully on domestic silicon. [[DeepSeek]] has struggled with Huawei hardware, making this achievement notable.

Simultaneously, [[DeepSeek]] expanded its context window from 128K to >1M tokens — a nearly 10x increase. Industry expects DeepSeek to release its next-gen architecture during Lunar New Year.

Stock up >50% this week after JPMorgan initiated coverage and GLM-5 launched.

## Cisco Silicon One G300 — 102.4 Tbps AI networking chip

[[Cisco]] unveiled the Silicon One G300 at Cisco Live EMEA (Amsterdam), its biggest play for AI data center networking:

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Switching throughput | 102.4 Tbps |
| Process | [[TSMC]] 3nm |
| Cooling | 100% liquid-cooled option |
| Energy efficiency | ~70% improvement |
| GPU utilization | +28% job completion time improvement |
| Network utilization | +33% |
| Availability | H2 2026 |

The G300 targets gigawatt-scale AI clusters for training, inference, and agentic workloads. "Shock absorber" features handle traffic spikes that bog down AI GPU clusters. New Cisco N9000 and 8000 systems powered by the G300.

Competitive context: [[NVIDIA]] (networking chip in Vera Rubin systems), [[Broadcom]] (Tomahawk series), and [[Arista Networks]] all competing for a slice of the $600B AI infrastructure spending boom. Cisco is late but the G300 is its most credible AI networking entry yet.

## AppLovin (APP) Q4 2025 — AXON machine prints money, stock sells off anyway

[[AppLovin]] reported a dominant quarter but shares fell amid the broader software selloff:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|
| Revenue | $1.66B | +66% | $5.48B (+70%) |
| GAAP EPS | $3.24 | Beat est by 10% | — |
| Adj EBITDA | $1.40B | +82% | $4.51B (+87%) |
| EBITDA margin | 84.4% | +700bps | 82% |
| Operating margin | 76.9% | — (vs 44.3% prior yr) | — |
| Free cash flow | $1.31B | +88% | $3.95B (+91%) |
| FCF margin | 79% | — | — |

Q1 2026 guidance: Revenue $1.745-1.775B (~52% YoY, ~3% above consensus), adj EBITDA $1.465-1.495B (84% margin).

84% EBITDA margin and 79% FCF margin are software industry records at this scale. [[AXON]] 3.0 (generative AI ads) and e-commerce expansion driving the acceleration.

Stock sold off despite the beat — swept up in sector-wide anxiety around [[Unity Technologies]] guidance miss and ongoing [[AI disintermediation]] fears. Shares -34% YTD despite 70% revenue growth.

## Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) Q4 2025 — record $440M revenue, $920M SiPho buildout, Intel dispute

[[Tower Semiconductor]] posted record results driven by silicon photonics and AI demand:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|
| Revenue | $440M (record) | +14% | $1.57B (+9%) |
| Gross profit | $118M | +27% QoQ | $364M |
| Operating profit | $71M | +39% QoQ | $194M |
| Net income | $80M | +48% QoQ | $220M |
| EPS (diluted) | $0.70 | Beat $0.69 est | $1.94 |

Q1 2026 guidance: Revenue $412M ± 5% (+15% YoY).

Major capex announcement: $920M total SiPho/SiGe investment (additional $270M for SiPho capacity and next-gen capabilities). Full qualification targeted Q4 2026, enabling >5x the Q4 2025 annualized wafer shipment run-rate. Over 70% of capacity presold through 2028 with customer prepayments.

Intel dispute: [[Intel]] signed a 2023 contract to manufacture 300mm wafers for Tower's customers in New Mexico. Intel has now expressed "intention not to perform." Parties in mediation. This adds uncertainty but Tower's own capacity expansion is the bigger story.

Stock ended -7.4% despite the beat — Intel dispute and heavy capex weighed on sentiment.

## Icertis exploring $5B sale with Goldman Sachs

[[Icertis]], the [[SoftBank]]-backed contract management platform, is working with [[Goldman Sachs]] on a potential sale at up to $5B:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation target | Up to $5B |
| Adviser | [[Goldman Sachs]] |
| Key backer | [[SoftBank]] Vision Fund II |
| Total funding | $560M+ |
| ARR | $300M+ |
| Status | Early discussions, buyout firms interested |

Context: [[SoftBank]] first invested at $5B in 2021 — flat valuation after 4 years is not great for a software company. Co-founder Samir Bodas passed away in late January at 61. The timing suggests the sale process may be partly estate/succession-driven.

CLM sits in the [[AI disintermediation]] crosshairs — contract review is exactly what LLMs do well. But Icertis has deep [[SAP]]/[[Microsoft]] integrations and 30%+ Fortune 100 penetration that create switching costs.

No final decision — Icertis could decide against a sale.

## Aberdeen Group — rebrand, FY2024 results, 2026 targets

[[Aberdeen]] is dropping the vowel-less "abrdn" name and rebranding as Aberdeen Group plc. CEO [[Jason Windsor]] called it "a pragmatic decision marking a new phase." Ticker stays ABDN.

FY2024 results show the turnaround gaining traction:

| Metric | FY 2024 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| IFRS profit before tax | £251M | vs £6M loss |
| Adj operating profit | £255M | +2.4% |
| AUM/A | £511.4B | +3% |
| Net outflows | £1.1B | vs £17.6B |
| Cost savings (annualised) | £100M+ | Transformation program |

Division story: [[Interactive Investor]] is the star — 439K customers (+8%), £5.7B net inflows (vs £2.9B), handles ~25% of UK retail share trading. Adviser division disappointed with £3.9B outflows (doubled). Investments division dramatically improved — outflows shrank from £19B to £4B, 60% of AUM now outperforming over 3 years (vs 51%).

2026 targets: ≥£300M adj operating profit (+18%), ~£300M net capital generation (+26%). Dividend maintained at 14.6p until covered ≥1.5x.

Strategic moves: sold European PE business (£92M gain), [[Finimize]] under review, repositioning Investments division toward real assets and credit under [[Xavier Meyer]].

Analyst views: [[RBC Capital]] Hold, [[Morgan Stanley]] Sell at 218 GBp.

## Aberdeen commodities survey — 60/40 dead, advisers underweight

[[Aberdeen]] and [[CoreData Research]] surveyed 300 US financial advisers ($116B AUA) on commodity allocations. Key findings:

| Finding | % |
|---------|---|
| 60/40 can't deliver needed resilience | 51% |
| Top priority: downside protection | 70% |
| Clients more open to commodities vs 5-10 yrs ago | 49% |
| Increasing alternative allocations | 54% |
| Clients unaware of commodity benefits | 66% |
| Find commodities harder to explain | 41% |

Current avg allocation 4.6% — well below the 6%+ that 44% of advisers consider optimal. Precious metals dominate interest (89%), followed by energy (50%). Most access commodities via sector-specific ETFs (60%) or broad-based products (56%).

The survey signals a structural underweight that could unwind as advisers increase alternatives. Connects to the [[base metals]] rally and [[Copper]]/[[Tin]] records covered above — physical supply tightness meets growing financial allocation appetite.

| Postpaid phone net adds | 962K | 3.3M |
| Broadband net adds | 558K | 2.0M (industry best) |
| Total customers | 142.4M | — |

## Hilton (HLT) Q4 2025 — record pipeline, 6.7% net unit growth, $3.5B 2026 return

[[Hilton]] reported record system size and development pipeline:

|--------|---------|---------|
| Adj EPS | $2.08 (beat $2.02) | $8.11 |

## Humana (HUM) Q4 2025 — Stars headwind wrecks 2026 outlook, stock near 8-year low

[[Humana]] beat on revenue but guided 2026 dramatically below street, driven by Medicare Advantage Stars rating headwinds:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $32.5B (+11.4%, beat) | — |
| GAAP EPS | -$6.61 (missed -$4.08 est) | $9.84 |
| Adj EPS | -$3.96 | $17.14 |
| Insurance benefit ratio | — | 90.4% |
| MA membership growth (AEP) | +1M (~20%) | — |

The Q4 GAAP loss reflects a $796M insurance segment loss. Full-year adj EPS of $17.14 was in line, above initial $16.25 guide.

2026 guidance is the problem: adj EPS "at least $9.00" vs street $11.92. The ~$3.5B Stars headwind crushes individual MA margins to slightly below breakeven. Management added 25% MA membership growth expected in 2026, but new members take time to become profitable.

Stock near $185 — down ~40% in 12 months, lowest in nearly 8 years. CenterWell expansion continues: 60-70 new primary care centers planned for 2026.

## Aehr Test Systems (AEHR) +40% — hyperscaler AI ASIC burn-in win

[[Aehr Test Systems]] secured an initial production order from a "premier large-scale data center provider" for package-level burn-in of its next-generation AI ASIC processors:

- Order: multiple Sonoma ultra-high-power burn-in systems + turnkey modules + device-specific sockets
- Delivery: summer 2026
- Customer profile: hyperscaler designing proprietary AI accelerator ASICs with "very significant" capex plans — likely [[Google]], [[Amazon]], or [[Microsoft]]
- Growth trajectory: customer forecasting "very large expansion" of Sonoma purchases in H2 2026 and into 2027

Stock surged ~40% on the news. This is Aehr's long-awaited validation of the AI burn-in opportunity beyond SiC power devices.

Context: the stock trades at ~460x forward earnings with negative operating margins. The bull case is that every custom AI ASIC needs production burn-in testing, and Aehr's Sonoma platform is the only proven solution for ultra-high-power packages.

## Google agentic commerce — Universal Commerce Protocol, buy inside Gemini

[[Google]] launched a sweeping set of agentic commerce features, positioning itself as the transaction layer for AI-era shopping:

New capabilities:
- Buy directly from [[Walmart]], [[Wayfair]], and [[Etsy]] inside Search AI Mode and [[Gemini]]
- Full checkout inside AI — partnered with [[Shopify]], [[Target]], and Walmart
- Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) — open standard for agentic commerce across platforms, co-developed with [[Target]]
- Direct Offers — new Google Ads pilot letting brands present exclusive deals (e.g., 20% off) directly in AI Mode. Early partners: [[Petco]], e.l.f. Cosmetics, [[Samsonite]], Rugs USA, [[Shopify]] merchants

Gemini scale: >10B tokens/minute via APIs (up from 7B last quarter), 750M+ MAUs.

VP Vidhya Srinivasan: "We aren't just bringing ads to AI experiences in Search; we are reinventing what an ad is."

This directly competes with [[Shopify]]'s Agentic Storefronts (covered in SHOP earnings above). The agentic commerce battleground is forming: Google (search → buy), Shopify (store → AI discovery), and eventually [[Amazon]] (logistics → AI agent).

## Microsoft explores superconducting power cables for AI data centers

[[Microsoft]] disclosed it is testing high-temperature superconductor (HTS) cables to deliver power inside data centers — zero resistance, zero heat loss:

| Spec | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Resistance | Zero (superconducting) |
| Space needed | 2m trench vs 70m overhead clearance |
| Power delivery | 3 MW via single cable (pilot test) |
| Heat generation | None |
| Status | Development/evaluation stage |

Partnership with [[VEIR]], a Massachusetts-based HTS cable manufacturer ($75M Series B). The fusion industry connection is key — scaled-up production of superconducting tape for fusion reactors ([[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] etc.) has driven cost reductions that now make data center applications viable.

Why it matters: single data center campuses now require >1 GW — enough for 750,000 homes. DOE estimates data centers will consume ~12% of US power by 2028 (3x from 2024). Traditional copper/aluminum distribution loses meaningful energy to resistance at this scale. HTS eliminates that loss.

The catch: cryogenic cooling requirements and material cost remain challenges. Not deployed at scale anywhere yet.

## Niobium concept note created

Created [[Niobium]] concept note covering the most concentrated critical mineral supply chain. [[Brazil]] produces 92% of global output; [[CBMM]] alone controls 77%. Used in HSLA steel (77% of demand), aerospace superalloys (21%), superconductors, and emerging NTO battery anodes ([[Toshiba]]/CBMM partnership — 80% charge in 10 minutes).

Market ~$2.9B (2024), growing at 7% CAGR. Both the US and [[China]] are 100% import-dependent. No futures market — CBMM is effectively the price-setter. Chinese entities hold 15% of CBMM plus own the #2 producer ([[CMOC Group]]).

[[NioCorp Developments]] is the only US project — raised $370M in 2025, $10M DOD grant, but faces $1.1B capex and EXIM financing dependency.

Stubs created: [[CBMM]], [[CMOC Group]], [[Magris Performance Materials]], [[Toshiba]], [[Sojitz]], [[Malawi]], [[Australian Strategic Materials]].
