## Markets

*Wednesday — markets open. NFP delayed from Feb 6 (government shutdown) released today.*

Dow 50,188 (record close Feb 10). S&P 6,942 (-0.3% Tue). Nasdaq 23,102 (-0.6% Tue). AI disintermediation fears continue to weigh on financials/software. Dollar at monthly lows, 10Y yields at 5-week lows.

## NFP January 2026 — strong headline, devastating revisions

The delayed January jobs report upended the labor market narrative:

| Metric | Value | vs Estimate |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Nonfarm payrolls | +130K | +70K est (beat) |
| Unemployment rate | 4.4% | 4.5% prior (improved) |
| December revised | +48K | Down from +50K |
| 2025 benchmark revision | -403K | Avg monthly gains: 49K → 15K |

The headline beat masks a much weaker underlying story. The BLS annual benchmark revisions slashed 2025 job growth from +584K to +181K — average monthly gains of just 15K, well below the previously reported 49K. This is one of the largest downward revisions in modern history.

Sector detail:
- Healthcare: +82K (ambulatory +50K)
- Social assistance: +42K
- Construction: +33K
- Manufacturing: +5K
- Federal government: -34K (deferred resignation program)
- Financial activities: -22K

Fed implications: Dallas Fed's [[Lorie Logan]] said Tuesday rates may not need further adjustment. But the benchmark revisions — revealing a labor market far weaker than understood — increase pressure for a March rate cut. Money markets raised April cut odds after the data.

Technical changes: BLS revised birth-death model to incorporate current sample information monthly. Establishment data revised back to Apr 2024 (NSA) and Jan 2021 (SA).

## Shopify (SHOP) Q4 2025 — revenue +31%, agentic commerce

[[Shopify]] beat across the board and announced a $2B buyback:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY change |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Revenue | $3.67B | +30.6% |
| GMV | $123.8B | +31.0% |
| GAAP EPS | $0.57 | Beat $0.43 est (+33.9%) |
| Adj EBITDA | $753M | Beat by 6.2% |
| Adj EBITDA margin | 20.5% | — |
| Operating margin | 17.2% | Flat YoY |
| FCF margin | 19.5% | Up from 17.8% QoQ |

Full year 2025: $11.6B revenue, $2B free cash flow, 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit FCF margins.

$2B share repurchase program authorized, effective Feb 17, 2026. No fixed expiration.

Agentic commerce: In December, Shopify launched Agentic Storefronts — helping brands be discovered on AI platforms ([[OpenAI|ChatGPT]], [[Perplexity]], [[Microsoft]] Copilot). This positions Shopify as the commerce layer for AI-driven shopping, where AI agents discover and transact on behalf of users.

Q1 2026 guidance: FCF margin in the low-to-mid teens (below Q1 2025), suggesting reinvestment.

Average analyst target: $179 vs ~$121 share price — significant upside implied.

## Dealogic/Mergermarket bonds hit by AI fears — disintermediation spreads to financial data

The [[AI disintermediation]] thesis claimed another victim. [[ION Group]]'s bonds — parent of financial data providers [[Dealogic]] and [[Mergermarket]] — sold off on fears that AI tools can replicate their deal intelligence and M&A data products.

This extends the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] pattern directly into financial data infrastructure. Dealogic provides deal league tables, origination data, and analytics to the top 50 investment banks. Mergermarket provides predictive M&A intelligence. Both are information intermediaries — exactly the business model AI disintermediation targets.

Connection to existing thesis: [[Thomson Reuters]] (-20%), [[RELX]] (-14%), [[FactSet]], [[Morningstar]] were equity victims in Week 1. Now the credit market is catching up — ION Group's leveraged debt structure makes it particularly vulnerable if revenue comes under pressure.

ION Group (Andrea Pignataro, founder) was already restructuring — combining Dealogic and Mergermarket under ION Analytics, refinancing expensive private debt with cheaper syndicated loans. The AI narrative complicates that refinancing.

## Dassault Systèmes (DSY.PA) crashes 18% — SaaSpocalypse's biggest European victim

[[Dassault Systèmes]] reported weak Q4 earnings and guided 2026 below expectations, triggering the worst single-day drop in company history. Trading was briefly suspended at the Paris open. ~€6B in market cap wiped out. UBS simultaneously downgraded the broader enterprise IT sector.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY2025 |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total revenue | €1,681M (+1% cc) | €6,236M (+4% cc) |
| Software revenue | €1,522M (-5% reported) | €5,638M |
| Recurring revenue | +3% | +6% |
| Subscription revenue | +4% | +11% |
| Cloud revenue | +9% | +8% |
| Non-IFRS op margin | 37.0% (+90bps cc) | 32.0% (+40bps) |
| Non-IFRS EPS | €0.40 (+9%) | €1.31 (+7%) |
| IFRS EPS | — | €0.90 (flat) |
| Cash from ops | — | €1.63B |

Segment detail:

| Division | Q4 2025 | Share | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| Industrial Innovation | +4% | 58% of software rev | Main growth engine. Transport & Mobility, High-Tech, Industrial Equipment driving |
| Life Sciences (Medidata) | -4% | 17% | Clinical trial headwinds — lower study volume |
| Mainstream Innovation (SOLIDWORKS) | +1% | 25% | SOLIDWORKS solid, CENTRIC PLM impacted by Cloud transition |

3DEXPERIENCE platform -3% in Q4 (strong comparison base + weak European auto). Cloud +9%.

2026 guidance missed: Revenue growth 3–5% (Street expected 5-7%), margin expansion 40-80bps, EPS +3-6%. Company introducing ARR reporting in 2026 to signal subscription transition.

CEO Pascal Daloz: company is "building new levers of growth and profitability by introducing unique Industrial AI offerings." Analyst presentation Feb 12-13.

Why it matters: This is the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis crossing the Atlantic. Dassault makes CAD/PLM/simulation software (CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, 3DEXPERIENCE). JPMorgan called results "worse than even the most negative had feared." The weak Q4 + soft guide played directly into the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative — software middlemen getting repriced.

Stock down >50% over 12 months. This isn't just an AI fear selloff — it's a growth deceleration dressed in AI panic.

![[dasty-price-chart.png]]
*DASTY $53→$21 since early 2024. The cliff on the right is today. Down >50% in 12 months — the SaaSpocalypse's biggest European casualty.*

## St. James's Place (STJ.L) hit by AI wealth management fears — down 16% from peak

[[St. James's Place]] — the UK's largest wealth manager — sold off on AI disruption fears, extending the [[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]] pattern to European markets. Stock hit 1,300p (lowest since Dec 15), down 16% from YTD high of 1,575p.

Not just SJP — the selloff rippled across UK wealth managers: [[Schroders]], [[Aberdeen]], [[M&G]], and [[Quilter]] all fell sharply.

Irony: SJP's actual business is strong. FY2025 new business inflows £21.9B (+19% YoY), net inflows £6.2B (+42% YoY), FUM £220B (record, +16%), retention 94.9%. Profit £805M (up from £577M). Earnings due Feb 25.

But the narrative overrides fundamentals. SJP's model — face-to-face advisers charging advisory fees — is exactly the model [[AI disintermediation]] targets. [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI ($60/seat/month tax planning) is a direct competitor to what SJP's 5,000+ advisers do manually.

US mirrors: [[Raymond James]] -8.8% (worst since Mar 2020), [[Charles Schwab]] -7.4%, [[LPL Financial]] -8.3%. Schwab CEO Rick Wurster went on Bloomberg to address the selloff.

Raymond James analyst called the fears "completely overblown." SJP's UK regulatory moat (FCA-licensed advisers) + relationship complexity gives it more protection than US wealth managers.

Analyst consensus: 9 Buy, 0 Sell. +5.8% implied upside to target.

## TSMC record January sales — AI demand unrelenting

[[TSMC]] reported record monthly revenue for January 2026:

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| January revenue | NT$401.3B (~$12.7B) | +37% YoY, +20% MoM |
| Previous record | Broken — highest monthly sales ever | — |

This follows the Q4 2025 blowout (revenue $33.7B, gross margin 62.3%, net margin 48.3% — all records). 2026 capex guided $52–56B (+40% YoY at high end).

A16 "Angstrom Era": TSMC's 1.6nm-class A16 process — mass production late 2026 — introduces backside power delivery, a radical re-architecting of how power reaches transistors. First confirmed partner: [[NVIDIA]] Feynman GPU architecture. The semiconductor industry has crossed from nanometer to sub-nanometer scale.

What it signals for NVIDIA: [[NVIDIA]] holds 92% of the data center GPU market (IoT Analytics). TSMC's record January sales provide the clearest signal yet that AI chip demand is accelerating, not plateauing. NVIDIA is poised to overtake [[Apple]] as TSMC's largest customer in 2026.

Analyst consensus: 94% of 63 analysts rate NVIDIA buy/strong buy. Avg target $254 (+33% upside). Evercore ISI top pick with $352 target (+85% upside).

## China AI IPO surge — Shanghai Biren, Baidu chip unit, MiniMax, Zhipu

China's AI sector is on fire in Hong Kong:

| Company | Event | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[Shanghai Biren]] | HK IPO | +120% on debut, retail subscription 2,300x oversubscribed |
| [[Baidu]] AI chip unit | Confidential HK filing | Spinning out AI chip division |
| [[MiniMax]] | IPO expected | Fast-growing AI startup |
| [[Zhipu]] | IPO expected | Major Chinese AI lab |

Context: Chinese AI and chip stocks have surged since [[DeepSeek]]-R1's breakout in early 2025. US chip restrictions have forced Chinese developers to innovate — and the results are cost-efficient, open-source models from [[Alibaba]] (Qwen), [[Moonshot AI]], MiniMax, and Zhipu.

But the gap persists. At a landmark Beijing meeting in January, Alibaba's Qwen technical lead Justin Lin gave a blunt assessment: the probability of a Chinese AI firm overtaking US frontrunners in 3-5 years is "below 20 percent."

Beijing has made AI application a national priority — action plan released in January for AI in manufacturing across 14 industries including steel, petrochemicals, NEVs, robotics, and medical equipment.

## Israel-US AI hub with SMR nuclear power

[[Israel]] and the [[United States]] have reached understandings on a major AI technology park in southern Israel, powered by nuclear energy:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Southern Israel (Negev) |
| Framework | Strategic AI cooperation agreement (signed Jan 2026) |
| Power source | Small modular reactors (SMRs), 50–300 MWe |
| MOU language | "High-intensity energy infrastructure" |

The official MOU remains vague, but analysts believe the reference to "high-intensity energy infrastructure" clearly points to SMRs. This would be Israel's first nuclear power capability, addressing the massive power demands of AI data centers.

Broader nuclear-AI convergence: Joins [[Meta]]'s 6.6GW nuclear agreements with [[Vistra]], [[TerraPower]], [[Oklo]], and [[Constellation Energy]]. [[Constellation Energy]]'s Three Mile Island restart for [[Microsoft]] expected 2027. Nuclear is rapidly moving from fringe to mainstream for AI power.

## Retired Navy reactors for AI data centers — HGP proposal

[[HGP Intelligent Energy]], a Texas-based firm, has proposed repurposing two retired US Navy nuclear reactors for an AI data center project:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Company | HGP Intelligent Energy (Texas) |
| Proposal | Repurpose 2 retired Navy nuclear reactors |
| Location | Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee |
| Capacity | 450–520 MW |
| Framework | Trump's Genesis Mission |
| Status | DOE loan guarantee requested |

If approved, this would be the first time a military reactor has been repurposed for civilian use.

The proposal comes under Trump's nuclear expansion push — four executive orders targeting US nuclear capacity from ~100 GW (2024) to 400 GW by 2050. The retired aircraft carrier/submarine reactors would deliver immediate capacity rather than waiting years for new construction.

Harvard Belfer Center published a paper on Feb 10 ("AI, Data Centers, and the U.S. Electric Grid: A Watershed Moment") highlighting Virginia's data center growth adding thousands of MW of nearly constant demand, compressing planning timelines.

## Siemens Energy (ENR.DE) Q1 FY2026 — record gas turbine orders, profit nearly triples

[[Siemens Energy]] reported blowout Q1 results, driven by AI data center power demand:

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Order backlog | €146B | Record |
| Gas turbines booked | 102 | Strongest quarter ever |
| Gas Services margin | 16.6% | Before special items |
| Grid Technologies margin | 17.6% | Orders +21.8% YoY |
| Gamesa operating loss | -€46M | Improved from -€374M YoY |

FY2026 guidance confirmed: 11-13% revenue growth (on €39.1B base), 9-11% profit margin, €3-4B net income, €4-5B FCF pre-tax.

Gas Services booked 102 turbines — 12 GW converted from reservations to firm orders, 12 GW new reservations. Regional mix: 40% US, 35% [[Europe]], 15% Middle East/[[China]]. CEO Bruch: reservations converting 1:1 into orders, pushing back on bubble fears.

Grid Technologies: US data-center orders in high triple-digit-million-euro range. [[Siemens]] Gamesa narrowing losses — plans to break even in FY2026.

Expansion: $1B+ US manufacturing investment (1,500 jobs), targeting [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] grid rebuilding (aiming for ~14 GW in Iraq).

Stock up ~10x in two years, market cap ~€137B. Deutsche Bank target €170, Jefferies €164, UBS reversed bearish stance to €175 (from €38).

## Base metals mania — copper record $14,500, tin $56,800, nickel +10%, LMEX at all-time high

The base metals complex has been on a historic run in early 2026, driven by Chinese speculative buying, supply disruptions, and AI/energy transition demand narratives:

| Metal | Recent high | Current | YTD / YoY |
|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| [[Copper]] | $14,500/t (record, Jan 29) | ~$13,050/t ($5.93/lb) | +26% YoY |
| [[Tin]] | $56,800/t (record, Jan 26) | ~$49,100/t | +57% YoY, +40% YTD before pullback |
| [[Nickel]] | $18,950/t (19-mo high, Jan 29) | ~$17,550/t | +13% YoY |
| Aluminum | Testing $3,100/t | ~$3,100/t | — |
| LMEX Index | Record (surpassed Mar 2022 peak) | Near highs | +7% YTD |

### Copper

Surged 11% in a single session — biggest move in 16+ years — as Chinese investors piled in. Hit $14,500/t before sharp retracement. Goldman estimates 600K ton surplus in 2025 but prices still hit records. [[China]]'s refined copper output growth slowing to ~5% in 2026 (half of 2025 pace). Citi holds $13,000/t avg forecast, flagging scrap supply response and demand destruction risk.

### Tin — structural deficit

The tightest fundamental story of the complex. BMI raised 2026 forecast to $35,000/t (well below current spot). Supply disruptions on all fronts:
- [[Indonesia]]: President Subianto ordered closure of 1,000 illegal tin mines in Sumatra. Refined tin exports -33% in 2024 to 46K tons.
- [[Myanmar]]: Man Maw mine (Wa State) — licenses issued but no verifiable export volumes.
- [[DRC]]: Bisie mine (Alphamin Resources) suspended operations.
- [[China]]: Resources depleted, smelters lack concentrates.

Tin has become an AI proxy — soldering demand for semiconductors and data centers. SHFE trading volume exceeded 1M tonnes in a single session (2x annual global physical usage), prompting Chinese authorities to warn against speculation.

Projected 13K-ton supply deficit by 2030. World Bank expects tin and copper to reach new nominal records.

### Nickel

Indonesia reaffirmed sharp quota cuts today — 260-270M tonnes, down ~30% from 379M in 2025 and below forecast 330M domestic consumption. Smelters may need to import or cut production. Vale Indonesia mine suspended. Despite this, structural oversupply persists — [[Nornickel]] projects 275K MT surplus, ING forecasts $15,250 avg.

### Chinese speculative wave

The common thread: Chinese investors riding momentum across the complex. Record SHFE volumes, algorithmic and retail participation, clear disconnect between financial positioning and physical demand. Goldman warns the rally faces headwinds from weak Chinese manufacturing demand. Physical buyers hesitating at current prices.

## BofA's Blanch: 2M bpd oil surplus, "electrons over molecules"

[[Francisco Blanch]] ([[Bank of America]] head of commodities) on Bloomberg today:

- Oil: ~2M bpd surplus in 2026. Brent avg $60 (from $68 in 2025). But floor from low inventories outside [[China]] and strategic reserve buying. Global consumption to 108M bpd by 2031 (from 104M in 2025).
- Natural gas: Neutral, $4/MMBtu Henry Hub.
- Electricity: Bullish — "electrons over molecules." AI commodity exposure via [[PJM]] market, expects it to trend higher.
- Gold: $4,000 target.
- Industrial metals: Bullish into 2026+.
- Geopolitical: Russia-[[Ukraine]] peace deal with sanctions relief would be "pretty bearish for commodity markets broadly."

## ALTM basket created — tracking alt managers as AI disintermediation control group

Created the [[Alternative asset managers basket|ALTM]] index to track [[Alternative Managers|alt managers]] / [[Private credit|private credit]] stocks that sold off during the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] Wave 1 (Feb 3-5) despite not being intermediaries.

| Ticker | Company | Weight | Feb 2-5 move |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| ARES | [[Ares Management]] | 27% | -16.8% |
| KKR | [[KKR]] | 21% | -13.3% |
| OWL | [[Blue Owl]] | 21% | -13.3% |
| BX | [[Blackstone]] | 16% | -10.2% |
| APO | [[Apollo]] | 8% | -5.3% |
| BAM | [[Brookfield]] | 7% | -4.1% |

The selloff was not beta — SPY was -2.6% over the same period, XLF -1.4%. Alt managers fell 5-17x the market. But they bounced back ~50% by Feb 10 as the market sorted originators/asset owners from advisory middlemen. On Feb 10 (wealth management catalyst), ALTM was flat while SCHW fell -7.4% and RJF -8.7%.

Key insight: [[Morgan Stanley]] fell only -2.4% on Feb 10 — diversification across IB/trading dilutes the wealth management hit. Excluded from [[AI financial disintermediation basket|AIFD]] for this reason.

Base date: Feb 2 = 100. Current: ~92. Script: `scripts/create_altm_index.py --store`

## PE software talent drain — concept note created

Created [[PE software talent drain]] concept note documenting the structural inability of PE-owned tech companies to compete for talent against public tech. The problem is compensation mechanics: public RSUs (liquid, quarterly vesting, capital gains) vs PE phantom equity (illiquid, exit-dependent, ordinary income).

Body count: [[Cloud Software Group]] (Vista/Elliott, $16.5B — "all the talent has been laid off or quit"), [[Zendesk]] (H&F/Permira, $10.2B — all founders departed), [[Cloudera]] (KKR/CD&R — equity grants "an absolute joke"), [[Dell]] (Silver Lake — voluntary departures "exceeded expectations," drove return to public markets).

The AI accelerant makes this existential: AI specialists command $206K avg (56-67% premium), top packages >$1M at [[Meta]]/[[Google]]/[[OpenAI]]. PE-owned companies can't compete. The vicious cycle: can't hire AI talent → can't build AI capabilities → products commoditized (SaaSpocalypse) → more talent leaves.

$440B in PE software acquisitions (2015-2025) exposed. [[UBS]] estimates 25-35% of private credit market at AI disruption risk. Isaac Kim (ex-[[Elliott Management]]): "Technology private equity, in its current form, is dead."

Connects to ALTM: the deeper reason alt managers sold off in Wave 1 was not that they're intermediaries — it's that their portfolio companies are, and the talent drain is the transmission mechanism for product deterioration.

## TotalEnergies (TTE) FY 2025 — adj net income $15.6B, Google solar deal, Venezuela exit

[[TotalEnergies]] reported Q4 and full year 2025 results, plus a string of strategic moves:

### FY 2025 results

| Metric | FY 2025 | YoY change |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Adj net income | $15.6B | -15% |
| Adj net income/share | $6.89 | — |
| Cash flow (ex WC) | $27.8B | -7% |
| Net investments | $17.1B | — |
| ROACE | 12.6% | Best among majors (4th consecutive year) |
| Hydrocarbon production | 2,529 kboe/d | +4% |
| Dividend | €3.40/share | +5.6% |
| Share buybacks | $7.5B | 122.6M shares |
| Payout ratio | 55% | — |
| Gearing | 15% | — |

Segment detail:

| Segment | Adj NOI | YoY |
|---------|---------|-----|
| E&P | $8.4B | -16% |
| Integrated [[LNG]] | $4.1B | -16% |
| Integrated Power | $2.2B | +2% |
| Refining & Chemicals | $2.4B | +10% |
| Marketing & Services | $1.4B | +1% |

Oil price decline (-15% YoY) drove the earnings drop, but production ramp-ups from Mero-2/3/4 ([[Brazil]]), Anchor and Ballymore (US), Fenix ([[Argentina]]), and Tyra ([[Denmark]]) provided volume growth.

2026 guidance: production +3% (targeting >2.6 Mboe/d in Q1), capex ~$15B (~$3B for low-carbon), cash flow >$26B at $60/b Brent, electricity production >60 [[TWh]] (+~25%), buybacks $3-6B at $60-70/b oil.

### Google solar deal (Feb 9)

Signed two long-term PPAs to deliver 1 GW of solar capacity — 28 [[TWh]] over 15 years — to power [[Google]]'s data centers in [[Texas]]. Sites: Wichita (805 MWp) and Mustang Creek (195 MWp). Construction starts Q2 2026. Another data point in the hyperscaler-energy convergence.

### Venezuela: "too expensive and too polluting" (Feb 11)

CEO Patrick Pouyanné rejected calls from [[Donald Trump]] for Big Oil to invest in [[Venezuela]], calling it "too expensive and too polluting." TotalEnergies fully exited Venezuelan oil & gas in 2022. The heavy crude economics don't fit TotalEnergies' strategy. Shares hit a new 52-week high.

### Namibia expansion (Feb 6)

Acquired 42.5% operated stake in PEL 104 from Eight Offshore and Maravilla Oil & Gas, following December's 40% stake in [[Galp]]'s Mopane discovery. [[Namibia]] is Africa's hottest exploration frontier.

## Robinhood (HOOD) Q4 2025 — record year, but crypto slide tanks stock 7%

[[Robinhood]] posted a record year but Q4 revenue missed on crypto weakness. Stock fell ~7% after hours.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY | FY 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.28B | +27% | $4.5B | +52% |
| Net income | $605M | — | $1.9B | — |
| Diluted EPS | $0.66 | Beat $0.61 est | $2.05 | — |
| Adj EBITDA | $761M | +24% | $2.5B | +76% |
| ARPU | $191 | +16% | — | — |

Revenue breakdown (Q4):

| Source | Q4 | YoY |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Transaction-based | $776M | +15% |
|   Options | $314M | +41% |
|   Crypto | $221M | -38% |
|   Equities | $94M | +54% |
|   Other (event contracts) | $147M | +300% |
| Net interest | $411M | +39% |
| Other | $96M | +109% |

Operating metrics:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Funded customers | 27.0M | +7% |
| Platform assets (AUC) | $324B | +68% |
| Gold subscribers | 4.2M | +58% |
| Net deposits (FY) | $68.1B | 35% organic growth |
| Equity notional volume | $710B | +68% |
| Options contracts | 659M | +38% |
| Retirement AUC | $26.5B | +102% |
| Margin book | $16.8B | +113% |

The miss was crypto: $221M in Q4 vs. much higher earlier quarters as the late-2025 crypto slide crimped volumes. [[Prediction markets]] were a bright spot — event contracts hit 8.5B traded, on track for a billion-dollar annual business.

Strategic moves: UK [[stocks and shares ISA]] launched, short selling rolled out (billions in notional volume), [[Bitstamp]] acquisition expanding global crypto. New CFO Shiv Verma replaced Jason Warnick (Feb 6). Vlad Tenev: building the "Financial SuperApp."

2026 outlook: adj opex + SBC of $2.6-2.725B (+18% midpoint).

Analyst reaction: [[Barclays]] $124 PT (from $159, overweight), [[Goldman Sachs]] $130 (from $152, buy). Consensus remains bullish — crypto jitters seen as transitory.

| Vehicles ([[Hot Wheels]]) | $1,995M | +10% |

North America -5%, International +4-6%. The margin compression came from higher discounts, inflation, FX headwinds, and tariff cost timing.

| Net sales | $5.4-5.6B (+3-6% cc) |
| Adj gross margin | ~50% |

TMNT license: [[Paramount Global|Paramount]] and Mattel signed a global multi-year deal for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] products starting 2027, including tie-ins for the animated sequel and a live-action/CG hybrid film in 2028.

CEO Ynon Kreiz noted December US gross billings grew less than expected. CFO flagged $50M in cost savings for 2026 (total program raised to $225M).

Q1 2026 guidance: gross bookings $4.86-5.00B (+17-20% YoY), adj EBITDA $120-140M (slightly below $139.8M consensus). California insurance legislation reduced rideshare pricing — management expects demand recovery in H2 2026.

$1B share buyback announced.

CEO [[David Risher]] called 2026 a "transformative year" — deepening [[Waymo]] autonomous partnership for a "hybrid network" of human drivers and AVs, targeting ~20% per-mile cost reduction by 2030. Market gave a "vote of no confidence" on the AV vision.

Other: [[Israel]] ride-hailing legislation approved (awaiting parliament), new teen service with safety features, [[Deborah Hersman]] joined board (transportation safety expert).
