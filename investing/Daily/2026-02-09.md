## Vault: Cooperative banking deep dive

Built out coverage of cooperative and promotional banks — a structurally distinct corner of global banking that touches [[Credit markets]], [[Green bonds]], and agricultural/public-sector lending.

### New actor notes

| Actor | Country | Total assets | Model |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| [[Credit Agricole]] | [[France]] | EUR 2.7T | Cooperative universal bank (Euronext: ACA) |
| [[Rabobank]] | [[Netherlands]] | EUR 629B | Cooperative (food/agri focus, Rabobank Certificates) |
| [[DZ Bank]] | Germany | EUR 660B | Central institution for 697 Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken |
| [[BNG Bank]] | [[Netherlands]] | EUR 128B | Promotional bank for Dutch public sector (AAA/AAA/Aaa) |
| [[CoBank]] | US | $209B | Farm Credit System bank (GSE, agency bonds) |
| [[Farm Credit System]] | US | $544B | GSE network — 4 banks, 60 associations, agency debt |

### Country stubs created

[[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Egypt]], [[Ukraine]] — all linked from [[Credit Agricole]] international retail operations.

### Database additions

- ACA.PA (Crédit Agricole), BNP.PA ([[BNP Paribas]]), UCG.MI ([[UniCredit]]) — price data added
- ACA.PA fundamentals fetched (Alpha Vantage annual; quarterly derived for chart rendering)

### Charts generated

- `aca.pa-vs-bnp.pa-vs-ucg.mi-price-chart.png` — [[UniCredit]] +600% since 2020 vs ~+100-130% for ACA and BNP. Italian bank re-rating story dwarfs French peers.
- `aca.pa-fundamentals.png` — steady revenue growth to EUR 27.2B, net income recovery from EUR 2.7B (2020 COVID) to EUR 7.1B (2024 record)

### Why this matters

Cooperative banks are underrepresented in equity-focused research but dominate fixed-income issuance in their markets. Key threads:

- [[Credit Agricole]] is the second-largest European bank by assets and the largest cooperative globally — its dual structure (listed CASA + mutualist regional banks) creates a permanent governance discount
- [[BNG Bank]] and [[NWB Bank]] are among the world's safest banks (AAA-rated) and major [[Green bonds]] issuers — relevant for institutional fixed-income portfolios
- [[Farm Credit System]] issues ~$350B+ in outstanding agency debt — second only to Fannie/Freddie in US GSE bond markets
- [[DZ Bank]] controls [[R+V Versicherung]] (Germany's largest cooperative insurer) and [[Union Investment]] (EUR 473B AUM) — a financial conglomerate hidden inside a cooperative structure
- [[Rabobank]] is the world's largest agricultural lender and a top-10 global food/agri bank — direct exposure to [[Lithium]], [[Batteries]], and agricultural commodity cycles

## Vault: Mining sector buildout

Expanded mining coverage from 5 actor notes to 14, filling gaps across the copper and gold mining universe.

### New actor notes

| Company | Ticker | Key detail |
|---------|--------|-----------|

| [[First Quantum Minerals]] | FM.TO | Cobre Panama $20B arbitration in 2026, Kansanshi S3 online Aug 2025, $4.75B net debt |
| [[Ero Copper]] | ERO | Tucumã commercial production Jul 2025, 67.5–77.5kt Cu guided for 2026 |

### Updated existing notes

| Note | Key changes |
|------|------------|
| [[Antofagasta]] | Stub → full note. 654kt Cu in 2025, Centinela $4.4B second concentrator adds 30% growth by 2027 |
| [[Barrick Gold]] | Major rewrite. Renamed Barrick Mining (GOLD → B). $76B market cap. New CEO. Record FY2025: $17B revenue, $5B net income. Copper thesis (450kt by 2030). NewCo IPO |

### Supporting notes

- Country stubs: [[DRC]], [[Zambia]], [[Panama]]
- [[Copper Mining]] sector note updated with all new miners
- [[Project Vault]] expanded: 83/17 debt-equity structure, membership mechanics, full OEM list, government equity stakes separated
- [[Strategic mineral stockpiles]] — new concept note comparing US, [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], EU models. Three archetypes: military reserve, state-controlled, public-private hybrid
- [[JOGMEC]] — new actor note. Japan's minerals agency: 34-metal stockpile (60–180 days), $600M+ invested in 100+ overseas projects, reduced China rare earth dependence 90% → 58%

### Copper coverage map

| Tier | Companies | Combined Cu |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Majors (>500kt) | [[Freeport-McMoRan]], [[Glencore]], [[BHP]], [[Antofagasta]], [[Southern Copper]] | ~5Mt+ |
| Growth (200–500kt) | [[Ivanhoe Mines]], [[Teck Resources]], [[Barrick Gold]] | ~1.1Mt, ramping |
| Mid-tier (<200kt) | [[Lundin Mining]], [[Capstone Copper]], [[Ero Copper]] | ~0.6Mt, growing fast |
| Distressed | [[First Quantum Minerals]] | ~0.4Mt (ex-Cobre Panama) |

Key themes: every major copper miner has an expansion story but execution varies wildly (QB2 TMF, Kamoa-Kakula flooding, Cobre Panama closure). Chile concentration risk across multiple names. DRC emerging as swing producer. Anglo American–Teck merger reshapes top-5.

### New sector notes

| Sector | Key players | Investable signal |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| [[AI Video Generation]] | [[Runway]], [[Kling AI]], [[Luma AI]], [[Pika Labs]], Sora, Veo, [[Stability AI]] | $615M (2024) → $2.56B (2032). Kling at $240M ARR in 19 months is fastest growth. Most pure-plays private; [[Kuaishou]] (01024.HK) only public proxy |
| [[AI-Native Studios]] | [[Fable Studios]], [[Promise]], [[Toonstar]], [[Moonvalley]], [[Invisible Universe]], [[Utopai Studios]] | 65+ AI studios launched since 2022. IP licensing emerging as business model — studios monetizing IP through AI rather than litigating |
| [[AI Avatars]] | [[Synthesia]] ($4B), [[HeyGen]], [[D-ID]] | $800M (2025) → $5.93B (2032). Synthesia at $150M ARR, HeyGen profitable at ~$95M ARR with 157 people |

### Product stub

[[LTX Studio]] — [[Lightricks]]' browser-based AI filmmaking platform, open-source model strategy

### Cross-sector observations

- **IP licensing is the frontier** — Disney–OpenAI ($1B), Fable studio deals, Moonvalley licensed-only training. Studios shifting from blocking AI to monetizing through it
- **China leads on revenue** — Kling ($240M ARR) outpaces all Western competitors on raw revenue despite lower pricing
- **Public exposure is thin** — most pure-plays are private. Best proxies: [[Kuaishou]] (Kling), [[Autodesk]] (Flow Studio), [[NVIDIA]] (picks and shovels), [[Adobe]] (tool integrations + Synthesia investment)
- **Economics unproven at frontier** — Sora costs ~$15M/day; AI-native studios claim 80-90% cost reduction but none have shipped at scale yet
