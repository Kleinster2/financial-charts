## Markets

S&P 500 -0.43% to 6,939 | Dow -0.36% to 48,892 | Nasdaq -0.94% to 23,462

Markets ended the week lower as rising Treasury yields and Trump's nomination of [[Kevin Warsh]] to replace [[Jay Powell|Fed Chair Powell]] spooked markets. January monthly performance: S&P +1.4%, Dow +1.7%, Nasdaq +1%, Russell 2000 +5%.

### Big movers

| Ticker | Move | Catalyst |
|--------|------|----------|
| [[Royal Caribbean\|RCL]] | +18.7% | Strong Q4, new ship orders, 2026 guidance |
| [[Meta\|META]] | +10.4% | Q4 beat, Q1 revenue outlook, price target upgrades |
| [[Verizon\|VZ]] | +11.8% | Best day since 2008 — beat estimates + strong FY outlook |
| [[Microsoft\|MSFT]] | -10% (Thu) | [[Azure]] growth deceleration, accelerating AI capex — $357B market cap wiped |
| [[KLA\|KLAC]] | -15%+ | Q2 beat but guidance suggested growth deceleration |

### Federal Reserve

FOMC held rates at 3.50%-3.75% on Wednesday (Jan 28). Split vote: [[Christopher Waller|Waller]] and [[Stephen Miran|Miran]] dissented, favoring 25bp cut. Powell: "There's an expectation that sometime in the middle quarters of the year we'll see tariff inflation topping out." Fed signals two more cuts later in 2026, likely starting summer. Powell's term ends in May.

**Warsh nomination:** Trump named former Fed Governor [[Kevin Warsh]] as his pick to replace Powell.

**Market reaction to Warsh:**

| Asset | Move | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 10Y yield | +2bp to 4.25% | Less dovish Fed expected |
| 2Y yield | -2bp to 3.53% | Near-term cuts still priced |
| 30Y yield | +3bp to 4.89% | Balance sheet concerns (Warsh opposes Fed holding bonds/MBS) |
| Dollar (DXY) | ↑ | Credibility boost |
| Gold | ↓↓ | Safe haven unwind — "flash crash" |
| XLF (financials) | Stable | Deregulation, yield curve steepening benefits |
| KRE (regionals) | Outperform | Dodd-Frank relief expected |

**Curve steepened** — long end up, short end down. Markets pricing Warsh as more hawkish than alternatives but still aligned with Trump on near-term cuts.

**Analyst reaction:**
- **BMO (Lyngen):** "By selecting Warsh, the Administration has clearly offered a nod to the necessity of Fed credibility"
- **El-Erian:** "Strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills... commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well"
- **Jamie Dimon:** Had previously signaled support, described Warsh as having "market credibility"

### AI & Tech

**[[Microsoft]] AI capex debate:** Beat on revenue/profit, but investors focused on rising AI infrastructure costs and Azure growth deceleration. Reignited "spend now, monetize later" concerns.

**S&P 500 crossed 7,000** (Jan 28) — just 14 months after first hitting 6,000. Driven by AI infrastructure maturation and "Big Four" ([[Microsoft|MSFT]], [[Meta|META]], [[Amazon|AMZN]], [[Alphabet|GOOG]]) projected capex of $505B in 2026.

**[[DeepSeek]] anniversary:** One year after the Chinese AI startup triggered a $589B single-day [[NVIDIA]] loss (Jan 27, 2025), fears proved unfounded. Hyperscaler capex soared rather than contracted.

**[[Anthropic]]'s [[Model Context Protocol|MCP]]** becoming the standard for AI agent interoperability — [[OpenAI]] and [[Microsoft]] adopted it; donated to [[Linux Foundation]]'s Agentic AI Foundation.

### Semiconductors

**Memory shortage continues:** [[Synopsys]] CEO says chip crunch will last through 2026-2027 as memory goes to AI infrastructure, starving other products.

**[[KLA]] earnings:** Beat Q2 estimates (revenue $3.30B, EPS $8.85) but stock fell 15%+ on forward guidance suggesting growth deceleration. Full-year 2025 was record revenue ($12.7B, +17% YoY).

**Market forecasts:** WSTS expects global semi market +25% YoY in 2026 to ~$975B. [[HBM]] market to $54.6B (+58% YoY per BofA). Memory prices expected +40% through Q2 2026 (Counterpoint).

### China

**AI momentum:** Xi's New Year address highlighted domestic AI models and semiconductor breakthroughs. [[Shanghai Biren]] IPO surged 120% in Hong Kong ($717M raise). [[Baidu]]'s AI chip unit filed for HK listing.

**IMF upgraded China forecast:** 5% for 2025, 4.5% for 2026. GDP hit record 140 trillion yuan ($20T) in 2025.

**15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030):** Emphasizes "New Quality Production Forces" — indigenous R&D, supply chain resilience, AI/robotics/quantum/6G.

**Structural headwinds:** [[Rhodium Group]]: High-tech added just 0.8pp to GDP from 2023-2025 while real estate declined 6pp.

### Tariffs / Trade War

**U.S.-Canada escalation:** Trump threatened 50% tariff on all Canadian aircraft + possible "decertification" of Canadian planes from U.S. airspace. [[Bombardier]] -7%.

**100% tariff ultimatum:** Trump demands Canada terminate its new trade deal with China or face blanket 100% tariff. PM [[Mark Carney]]'s Davos speech condemning "economic coercion" escalated tensions.

**Other:** Taiwan trade deal (reciprocal tariff 20% → 15%). European deal framework on Greenland/Arctic with NATO. U.S. tariff revenue +$187B in 2025 (~200% increase).

### Commodities

**Gold:** Hit record $5,608/oz Thursday, profit-taking to ~$5,150/oz Friday (-4.6%). On track for +15% monthly gain — strongest since 1980s. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw record $4.7B inflows in January.

**Treasuries:** 10Y at 4.26% (+2bp), 30Y at 4.89% (+3bp).
