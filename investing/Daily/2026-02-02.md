## Ford-China EV partnership talks

**FT: Ford held preliminary talks with [[Xiaomi]] and [[BYD]] about US manufacturing JV**

- CEO Farley personally owns Xiaomi SU7, called Chinese EVs "existential threat"
- Ford denies story; FT has 4 sources
- Trump (Jan 2026 at Ford Dearborn): Open to Chinese plants hiring Americans
- [[Geely]] also signaling US entry within 3 years

**Why it matters:**
- Ford discontinued Escape/Edge, nothing until 2027 Universal EV Platform
- Chinese EVs 30-50% cheaper — cost gap unbridgeable without tech transfer
- Political minefield: House China Committee chair calls it "turning its back on American partners"

**Implications:**
- Validates [[Short Tesla]] thesis — legacy OEMs may partner with Chinese competition rather than compete
- If any deal happens, domino effect likely (GM, Stellantis forced to follow)
- Trump's dealmaking instincts vs national security hawks = policy uncertainty

## Google grid bottleneck

[[Google]] executives publicly confirmed what the data already showed — grid interconnection is the binding constraint on AI infrastructure:

- **Marsden Hanna** (Global Head of Sustainability): Wait times exceed **12 years** in some US areas
- **Amanda Peterson Corio** (Global Head of DC Energy): Google pursuing colocation strategy — "siting next to power generation and creating industrial parks" to bypass queue

This explains the $4.75B [[Intersect Power]] acquisition. Power, not capital or chips, determines who can scale.

**Implications:**
- Validates [[Power constraints]] thesis
- Winners: IPPs, solar/storage developers, grid equipment
- Losers: Traditional utility plays dependent on interconnection
- The capex arms race ([[AI capex arms race]]) is now a power race

## CoreWeave Davos interview (Jan 21)

[[CoreWeave]] CEO Mike Intrator at Barron's Davos interview. Key points:

**NVIDIA relationship:** "Symbiotic but not equal" — CoreWeave gets chips first (H100 → H200 → GB200 → Rubin) because their software layer enables rapid production-scale deployment. NVIDIA develops in labs, CoreWeave tests in the wild.

**"The Box" financing:**
- SPV structure: GPUs + offtake contract + DC contract + PPA
- Waterfall: power → DC → principal/interest → CoreWeave
- "Pay me my goddamn money back" — East Coast capital's only rule
- "Equity slug" — after 5-year contract, CoreWeave owns GPUs with residual value
- Not speculative: GPUs pre-sold before purchase

**Constraints:** "Systemically pinned on demand" — neoclouds, hyperscalers, chip manufacturers all redlined. Power shell is the bottleneck.

**Keiretsu criticism:** Intrator's copper analogy — facing systemic shortage requires industry collaboration. "If I say that, man, it's going to get ugly."

**Scale:** 42 data centers (US, Canada, Western Europe, Nordics). ~$50B market cap.
