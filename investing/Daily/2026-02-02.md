## Google grid bottleneck

[[Google]] executives publicly confirmed what the data already showed — grid interconnection is the binding constraint on AI infrastructure:

- **Marsden Hanna** (Global Head of Sustainability): Wait times exceed **12 years** in some US areas
- **Amanda Peterson Corio** (Global Head of DC Energy): Google pursuing colocation strategy — "siting next to power generation and creating industrial parks" to bypass queue

This explains the $4.75B [[Intersect Power]] acquisition. Power, not capital or chips, determines who can scale.

**Implications:**
- Validates [[Power constraints]] thesis
- Winners: IPPs, solar/storage developers, grid equipment
- Losers: Traditional utility plays dependent on interconnection
- The capex arms race ([[AI capex arms race]]) is now a power race
