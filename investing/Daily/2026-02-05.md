## Alphabet Earnings — Beat Everything, Capex Stunned

[[Alphabet]] reported Q4 2025 after close Wednesday:

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | **$113.8B** | $111.4B |
| EPS | **$2.82** | $2.63 |
| Net income | $34.5B | — |
| YoY revenue | **+18%** | +15% |
| Google Cloud | **$17.7B** (+48%) | +35% |
| YouTube ads | $11.4B (+9%) | $11.8B |
| **2026 capex guidance** | **$175-185B** | **$119.5B** |

**First company to cross $400B annual revenue.**

**The capex shock:** 2026 capex of $175-185B is ~55% above Street expectations. Stock whipsawed — fell 6% after hours on the capex number, then recovered to -2.4% premarket as Cloud +48% sank in.

**YouTube missed** — $11.4B vs $11.8B expected. Only weak spot.

**Capex implications for AI infrastructure:** If Google is spending $175-185B, total Mag 7 AI capex is heading well above $500B. Bullish for [[NVIDIA]], [[Broadcom]] (AVGO +5.6% premarket on custom TPU work), data center REITs.

## Thomson Reuters — Solid Quarter, Stock Still Crushed

[[Thomson Reuters]] reported Q4 2025 this morning:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $2,009M | +5% |
| Organic revenue | +7% | |
| Adj EBITDA | $777M | +8% |
| FY EBITDA margin | 39.2% | +100bp |
| 2026 organic guide | **7.5-8.0%** | |
| Dividend | +10% to $2.62 | 33rd consecutive raise |

"Big 3" segments (Legal, Corporates, Tax) grew organic revenue +9%.

**The problem:** Stock already down ~20% from the Feb 3 selloff. Guidance of 7.5-8% organic growth is solid but doesn't address the existential AI question investors are pricing in. CoCounsel AI tool generating $32B in efficiency savings for clients, but that's also the bull case for disruption.

Key test: Does the stock bounce on "numbers are fine" or keep falling on "AI will eat Westlaw"?
