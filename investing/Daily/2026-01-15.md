## Headlines

### Global semiconductor investment race

Bloomberg/SIA data on global chips funding (planned vs allocated):

| Country/Region | Planned | Allocated | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **US (CHIPS Act)** | $39B | $32.8B | Expected spending |
| **US (Total)** | $75B | — | +$75B loans, tax breaks |
| **EU** | $46.3B | — | EU Chips Act expected |
| Germany | $21.5B | $18.3B | Largest EU recipient |
| Spain | $12.9B | — | |
| Italy | $4.6B | — | |
| France | — | $3.1B | |
| Netherlands | — | $2.7B | ASML home |
| UK | $1.3B | — | |
| **China** | **$142B** | — | Largest globally |
| **South Korea** | $55B | — | Tax incentives |
| **Japan** | $25.3B | $16.7B | |
| **Taiwan** | $16B | — | Tax incentives |
| **India** | $10B | $7.1B | |

**Key insight:** China's $142B dwarfs all others — US ($75B total) and EU ($46.3B) combined still less than China.

### H200 China export framework

Commerce Department eases stance — case-by-case review replaces presumed denial.

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Review process | Case-by-case (eased from presumed denial) |
| US shortage certification | Must certify no domestic shortage |
| **China volume cap** | **≤50% of US market production** |
| Applies to | [[NVIDIA]] H200, [[AMD]] chips |

**Chinese response:** Global Times dismissed conditions as "discriminatory" — "not applied to other US trading partners but targeted specifically at China."

**Bloomberg Intelligence (Michael Deng):** "Calibrated attempt" at maintaining US capability advantage. Combined requirements "may be overly burdensome" and "could be undermined further by opposition from Congress and Beijing."

### TSMC Q4 2025 earnings

**Results beat, guidance beats:**

| Metric | Value | vs Expect |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Q4 Net income** | NT$505.7B ($16B) | Beat |
| Q4 Revenue | $33.1B | (reported earlier) |
| **FY2025 Revenue** | **>$100B** | First time ever |
| FY2025 growth | >30% | |

**2026 Guidance (stronger than expected):**

| Metric | Guidance | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Capex** | **$52B-$56B** | Up ≥25% from 2025 |
| **Revenue growth** | **~30%** | Faster than Street |

**Key implications:**
- AI demand longevity confirmed — "bullish signal on AI development frenzy"
- US investment commitment expected: up to **$165B** total
- Memory crunch headwind: smartphone shipments -11.6% expected (Macquarie)
- Plants building in Japan (2nm pivot) and Germany

**Stock:** Fresh all-time high ~NT$1,600+. Short interest only ~0.5% of float — shorts not betting against the AI monopolist.

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Evidence | Direction |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| [[US-China tech race]] | China $142B vs US $75B semiconductor spending | Context |
| [[Long WFE]] | Global capex = equipment demand; TSMC capex $52-56B | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Long NVIDIA]] | H200 China path opens, but 50% cap + requirements may be burdensome | ⚖️ Mixed |
| [[Export controls]] | Easing from presumed denial to case-by-case review | 🔄 Policy shift |
| [[Long TSMC]] | Q4 beat, 2026 capex/revenue guidance beats Street | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | TSMC notes memory crunch hurting smartphone (-11.6% expected) | ✅ Confirming |
