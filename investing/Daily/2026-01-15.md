## Headlines

### Global semiconductor investment race

Bloomberg/SIA data on global chips funding (planned vs allocated):

| Country/Region | Planned | Allocated | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **US (CHIPS Act)** | $39B | $32.8B | Expected spending |
| **US (Total)** | $75B | — | +$75B loans, tax breaks |
| **EU** | $46.3B | — | EU Chips Act expected |
| Germany | $21.5B | $18.3B | Largest EU recipient |
| Spain | $12.9B | — | |
| Italy | $4.6B | — | |
| France | — | $3.1B | |
| Netherlands | — | $2.7B | ASML home |
| UK | $1.3B | — | |
| **China** | **$142B** | — | Largest globally |
| **South Korea** | $55B | — | Tax incentives |
| **Japan** | $25.3B | $16.7B | |
| **Taiwan** | $16B | — | Tax incentives |
| **India** | $10B | $7.1B | |

**Key insight:** China's $142B dwarfs all others — US ($75B total) and EU ($46.3B) combined still less than China.

### H200 China export framework

Commerce Department eases stance — case-by-case review replaces presumed denial.

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Review process | Case-by-case (eased from presumed denial) |
| US shortage certification | Must certify no domestic shortage |
| **China volume cap** | **≤50% of US market production** |
| Applies to | [[NVIDIA]] H200, [[AMD]] chips |

**Chinese response:** Global Times dismissed conditions as "discriminatory" — "not applied to other US trading partners but targeted specifically at China."

**Bloomberg Intelligence (Michael Deng):** "Calibrated attempt" at maintaining US capability advantage. Combined requirements "may be overly burdensome" and "could be undermined further by opposition from Congress and Beijing."

### Memory shortage crushing smartphone forecasts

Counterpoint Research slashes 2026 smartphone outlook — AI memory prioritization hitting consumer electronics.

| Metric | Previous | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 2026 shipment growth | +0.45% | **-2.1%** |
| 2025 shipment growth | +3.3% | +3.3% |
| ASP increase (2026) | — | **+6.9%** |
| Component cost increase | — | +10-25% |

**Winners/Losers:**

| OEM | Position | Why |
|-----|----------|-----|
| Apple | Best positioned | Margin buffer |
| Samsung | Best positioned | Margin buffer |
| Honor | Most vulnerable | Low margins, -4% forecast |
| Oppo | Vulnerable | Low margins |
| Xiaomi | Vulnerable | Already warned on prices |

**Key dynamics:**
- AI buildout causing producers to prioritize HBM over commodity DRAM
- Entry-level smartphones hit hardest
- OEM responses: push premium, reuse old components, downgrade specs, less memory
- Lenovo stockpiling memory in anticipation
- Nintendo Switch 2 concerns (shares down most of December)

### TSMC Q4 2025 earnings

**Results beat, guidance beats:**

| Metric | Value | vs Expect |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Q4 Net income** | NT$505.7B ($16B) | Beat |
| Q4 Revenue | $33.1B | (reported earlier) |
| **FY2025 Revenue** | **>$100B** | First time ever |
| FY2025 growth | >30% | |

**2026 Guidance (stronger than expected):**

| Metric | Guidance | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Capex** | **$52B-$56B** | Up ≥25% from 2025 |
| **Revenue growth** | **~30%** | Faster than Street |

**Key implications:**
- AI demand longevity confirmed — "bullish signal on AI development frenzy"
- US investment commitment expected: up to **$165B** total
- Memory crunch headwind: smartphone shipments -11.6% expected (Macquarie)
- Plants building in Japan (2nm pivot) and Germany

**Stock:** Fresh all-time high ~NT$1,600+. Short interest only ~0.5% of float — shorts not betting against the AI monopolist.

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Evidence | Direction |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| [[US-China tech race]] | China $142B vs US $75B semiconductor spending | Context |
| [[Long WFE]] | Global capex = equipment demand; TSMC capex $52-56B | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Long NVIDIA]] | H200 China path opens, but 50% cap + requirements may be burdensome | ⚖️ Mixed |
| [[Export controls]] | Easing from presumed denial to case-by-case review | 🔄 Policy shift |
| [[Long TSMC]] | Q4 beat, 2026 capex/revenue guidance beats Street | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | Counterpoint: smartphone shipments -2.1% (was +0.45%), ASP +6.9% | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Long memory]] | DRAM shortage = pricing power for SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron | ✅ Confirming |
| [[Short consumer electronics]] | Honor -4%, Oppo/Xiaomi vulnerable to margin squeeze | ✅ Confirming |

## Vault activity

### Created

| Note | Type | Topic |
|------|------|-------|
| [[Short interest]] | Concept | Contrarian indicator — low SI after parabolic run = crowded longs |
| [[Short interest tracker]] | Tracker | Monthly SI snapshots for public companies |

### Modified

| Note | Changes |
|------|---------|
| [[US-China tech race]] | Added detailed global investment table from Bloomberg/SIA |
| [[NVIDIA]] | Added H200 China export framework details + short interest history |
| [[Export controls]] | Added Jan 2026 policy shift (case-by-case review) |
| [[TSMC]] | Added Q4 2025 results + 2026 guidance + short interest history (quarterly) |
| [[Apple]] | Added short interest history table |
| [[Microsoft]] | Added short interest history table |
| [[Google]] | Added short interest history table |
| [[Amazon]] | Added short interest history table |
| [[Meta]] | Added short interest history table |
| [[Tesla]] | Added short interest history table (note: historically high SI) |

### Infrastructure

- Added `short_interest` table to SQLite database (normalized: ticker + settlement_date)
- Added `/api/short-interest` and `/api/short-interest/latest` API endpoints
- Created `scripts/update_short_interest.py` fetcher (yfinance source)
- **Pending decision:** How to integrate SI time series into charting UI (see open threads)

---

## Open threads

- [ ] Update markets after close
- [ ] Add any headlines from today
- [ ] **Short interest charting integration** — DB table + API exist, need to decide how to expose in charts:
  - Option A: Synthetic tickers (`AAPL_SI_PCT`, `AAPL_SI_DAYS`)
  - Option B: Separate chart type / overlay UI
  - Option C: Wide table integrated with `/api/data`
