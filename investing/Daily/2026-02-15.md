## Pentagon threatens to cut off Anthropic (Feb 15)

Axios exclusive: Pentagon "fed up" with [[Anthropic]], threatening to end relationship over refusal to allow "all lawful purposes" military use of Claude. ~$200M contract (via [[Palantir]]) at stake. Anthropic's two red lines: fully autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of Americans. Other three contractors ([[Google]], [[OpenAI]], [[xAI]]) showing more flexibility — at least one already agreed to "all lawful purposes." Administration official: "everything's on the table." Follows Feb 13 report that Claude was used in [[Maduro capture 2026|Maduro capture]] operation. Updated [[Anthropic]] actor note with full timeline and analysis. Cross-referenced [[Palantir]].

## Norway wealth tax backfire

New actor note **[[Norway]]** and concept notes **[[Wealth tax]]**, **[[Capital flight]]**, **[[Laffer curve]]**. Norway raised its wealth tax from 0.85% → 1.1% in 2022 under [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], expecting +$146M/year. Instead: $54B in wealth left the country, 500+ wealthy residents emigrated (2022–2023), tax revenue dropped $594M → net loss of $448M. [[Kjell Inge Røkke]] (Norway's richest, [[Aker ASA]] chairman) moved to Lugano, Switzerland. 105 of Norway's 400 richest now live abroad. Stubs: [[Kjell Inge Røkke]], [[Aker ASA]], [[Government Pension Fund Global]], [[Jonas Gahr Støre]]. Sources: Guardian, Reuters, Fortune, Dagens Næringsliv, Civita think tank.

## Ellison AI-IP vertical integration thesis

New thesis note: **[[Ellison AI-IP vertical integration]]**. The Ellison family is assembling both sides of the AI-content stack — [[Larry Ellison]] builds AI cloud infrastructure ([[Oracle]] + [[TikTok]] partnership, 15% equity, hosts 170M Americans' data), while [[David Ellison]] hoards IP (Paramount acquired, $108B hostile bid for [[Warner Bros Discovery]]). [[Seedance]] 2.0 proved the timeline is compressing — [[ByteDance]]'s AI generates Hollywood-quality content from 2-line prompts, and the same ByteDance runs on Oracle infrastructure. [[Disney]], [[Paramount Global]], [[SAG-AFTRA]], and [[MPA]] all fired back with cease-and-desists and condemnations this week. Updated actor notes: [[David Ellison]], [[Larry Ellison]], [[Oracle]], [[ByteDance]], [[Skydance Media]], [[Paramount Global]], [[Warner Bros Discovery]]. Updated product note: [[Seedance]]. Created stubs: [[SAG-AFTRA]], [[MPA]].

## Berkshire alpha and Reg FD debate

New concept notes: **[[Regulation Fair Disclosure]]** and **[[Buffett's Alpha]]**. [[Chamath Palihapitiya]] argued (All-In Podcast, Feb 2026) that [[Warren Buffett]]'s alpha disappeared when [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|Reg FD]] took effect in Oct 2000 — pre-2000, selective disclosure of material info to favored investors was legal. Data supports the timing: [[Berkshire Hathaway]] generated +16.8% annual alpha (t-stat 3.13) from 1981–2002, then roughly tracked/trailed the S&P 500. But the Frazzini/Kabiller/Pedersen paper attributes outperformance to ~1.6x leverage via insurance float + low-beta/high-quality factor tilts, not information advantages. Alpha becomes statistically insignificant after factor controls. Post-2000 decline likely a combination: Reg FD, size constraints ($900B+ cap), factor crowding, $347B cash drag, tech underweight. Updated [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and [[Warren Buffett]] actor notes.

## Concepts

- **[[K-shaped economy]]** — new concept note. Deep research on the structural divergence between asset owners and wage-dependent households. Origins traced from Reagan-era deregulation → 2008 GFC → COVID. Current 2025-2026 manifestation: S&P 500 ~5,800→6,800+ while UMich Consumer Sentiment crashed 72→50. Gini coefficient at 60-year highs, top 1% at record 32% of net wealth, bottom 80% spending hasn't outpaced inflation in 6 years. BofA (Feb 2026) argues K evolving into "E-shape" as middle class separates from lower income. Peter Atwater (who coined the term) warns of "caste effect." Sources: CNBC, Business Insider, Fortune/BofA, NYT, US Bank, MSNBC Velshi.

## OpenAI Aardvark — security research agent

Added Aardvark section to [[OpenAI]] actor note. Aardvark is OpenAI's AI-powered security vulnerability scanner — first product in "Codex Security" suite. Launched Q4 2025 in private beta under [[Matt Knight]] (VP/CISO, resigned late Jan 2026). Expanded beta announced Feb 5 alongside GPT-5.3-Codex + "Trusted Access for Cyber" pilot + $10M API credits for OSS cyber defense. Used to find vulns in projects like [[Next.js]]. Competitive landscape: [[Snyk]], [[Semgrep]], [[GitHub]] GHAS established; [[Anthropic]] and [[AWS]] security tools described as "demoware." Strategic significance: OpenAI moving beyond chatbot/API into enterprise security tooling, trying to own both code generation and code security. Peter Steinberger (@steipete) got access Feb 14: "quite a goated tool to find security vulnerabilities."

## Anthropic Skills platform

Added Skills platform section to [[Anthropic]] actor note + dedicated concept note **[[Claude Skills]]**. Skills are packaged instruction folders (`SKILL.md` + assets) that teach [[Claude]] reusable workflows — launched as an **open standard** (Dec 18, 2025). Guide published Jan 29, 2026 (32 pages). Skills API: `/v1/skills` endpoint, `container.skills` in Messages API. Works across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Partner directory: [[Asana]], [[Atlassian]], [[Canva]], [[Figma]], [[Sentry]], [[Zapier]]. Three-level progressive disclosure architecture (frontmatter always loaded → SKILL.md on match → references on demand). Five reusable patterns: sequential workflow, multi-MCP coordination, iterative refinement, context-aware tool selection, domain-specific intelligence. This completes Anthropic's platform stack: Models → [[MCP]] (connectivity) → Skills (knowledge) → Code Execution (environment). Competes with [[OpenAI]]'s custom GPTs/agent SDK but via open-standard portability rather than lock-in. Updated [[AI extensibility]] concept note Skills references.

YouTube (12.5% of all US TV viewing) rendering Google TV strategically less essential. 2025 budget cuts: 25% team layoff, shorter bounty agreements.

Fixed 2 alias issues in Baron Capital: `[[Hyatt Hotels]]` → `[[Hyatt]]`, `[[On Holding]]` → `[[On Running]]`.

## SpaceX private price chart + `/api/chart/image` enhancements

Created [[SpaceX]] private market price chart — 24 funding rounds from Series A ($0.10, 2002) to Jan 2026 secondary ($588), 5,880x over 24 years on log scale. Built using `/api/chart/image` (matplotlib endpoint) after discovering [[Lightweight Charts]] can't handle sparse, extreme-range data (auto-zooms to dense recent data, clips early history). New reusable params added to endpoint: `log` (log scale y-axis), `label` (custom legend), `markers` (dot overlay), `point_labels` (per-point annotations). Y-axis on right side, $1,000 dashed reference line. Documented in `docs/chart-api.md` with sparse data guidance: don't forward-fill, store only actual data points, matplotlib draws straight lines between them natively.
