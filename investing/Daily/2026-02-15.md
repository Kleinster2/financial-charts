## Pentagon threatens to cut off Anthropic (Feb 15)

Axios exclusive: Pentagon "fed up" with [[Anthropic]], threatening to end relationship over refusal to allow "all lawful purposes" military use of Claude. ~$200M contract (via [[Palantir]]) at stake. Anthropic's two red lines: fully autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of Americans. Other three contractors ([[Google]], [[OpenAI]], [[xAI]]) showing more flexibility — at least one already agreed to "all lawful purposes." Administration official: "everything's on the table." Follows Feb 13 report that Claude was used in [[Maduro capture 2026|Maduro capture]] operation. Updated [[Anthropic]] actor note with full timeline and analysis. Cross-referenced [[Palantir]].

*Sources: [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/15/claude-pentagon-anthropic-contract-maduro), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-threatens-cut-off-anthropic-ai-safeguards-dispute-axios-reports-2026-02-15/)*

## Norway wealth tax backfire

New actor note **[[Norway]]** and concept notes **[[Wealth tax]]**, **[[Capital flight]]**, **[[Laffer curve]]**. Norway raised its wealth tax from 0.85% → 1.1% in 2022 under [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], expecting +$146M/year. Instead: $54B in wealth left the country, 500+ wealthy residents emigrated (2022–2023), tax revenue dropped $594M → net loss of $448M. [[Kjell Inge Røkke]] (Norway's richest, [[Aker ASA]] chairman) moved to Lugano, Switzerland. 105 of Norway's 400 richest now live abroad. Stubs: [[Kjell Inge Røkke]], [[Aker ASA]], [[Government Pension Fund Global]], [[Jonas Gahr Støre]]. Sources: Guardian, Reuters, Fortune, Dagens Næringsliv, Civita think tank.

## Ellison AI-IP vertical integration thesis

New thesis note: **[[Ellison AI-IP vertical integration]]**. The Ellison family is assembling both sides of the AI-content stack — [[Larry Ellison]] builds AI cloud infrastructure ([[Oracle]] + [[TikTok]] partnership, 15% equity, hosts 170M Americans' data), while [[David Ellison]] hoards IP (Paramount acquired, $108B hostile bid for [[Warner Bros Discovery]]). [[Seedance]] 2.0 proved the timeline is compressing — [[ByteDance]]'s AI generates Hollywood-quality content from 2-line prompts, and the same ByteDance runs on Oracle infrastructure. [[Disney]], [[Paramount Global]], [[SAG-AFTRA]], and [[MPA]] all fired back with cease-and-desists and condemnations this week. Updated actor notes: [[David Ellison]], [[Larry Ellison]], [[Oracle]], [[ByteDance]], [[Skydance Media]], [[Paramount Global]], [[Warner Bros Discovery]]. Updated product note: [[Seedance]]. Created stubs: [[SAG-AFTRA]], [[MPA]].

## Berkshire alpha and Reg FD debate

New concept notes: **[[Regulation Fair Disclosure]]** and **[[Buffett's Alpha]]**. [[Chamath Palihapitiya]] argued (All-In Podcast, Feb 2026) that [[Warren Buffett]]'s alpha disappeared when [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|Reg FD]] took effect in Oct 2000 — pre-2000, selective disclosure of material info to favored investors was legal. Data supports the timing: [[Berkshire Hathaway]] generated +16.8% annual alpha (t-stat 3.13) from 1981–2002, then roughly tracked/trailed the S&P 500. But the Frazzini/Kabiller/Pedersen paper attributes outperformance to ~1.6x leverage via insurance float + low-beta/high-quality factor tilts, not information advantages. Alpha becomes statistically insignificant after factor controls. Post-2000 decline likely a combination: Reg FD, size constraints ($900B+ cap), factor crowding, $347B cash drag, tech underweight. Updated [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and [[Warren Buffett]] actor notes.

## Concepts

- **[[K-shaped economy]]** — new concept note. Deep research on the structural divergence between asset owners and wage-dependent households. Origins traced from Reagan-era deregulation → 2008 GFC → COVID. Current 2025-2026 manifestation: S&P 500 ~5,800→6,800+ while UMich Consumer Sentiment crashed 72→50. Gini coefficient at 60-year highs, top 1% at record 32% of net wealth, bottom 80% spending hasn't outpaced inflation in 6 years. BofA (Feb 2026) argues K evolving into "E-shape" as middle class separates from lower income. Peter Atwater (who coined the term) warns of "caste effect." Sources: CNBC, Business Insider, Fortune/BofA, NYT, US Bank, MSNBC Velshi.

## OpenAI Aardvark — security research agent

Added Aardvark section to [[OpenAI]] actor note. Aardvark is OpenAI's AI-powered security vulnerability scanner — first product in "Codex Security" suite. Launched Q4 2025 in private beta under [[Matt Knight]] (VP/CISO, resigned late Jan 2026). Expanded beta announced Feb 5 alongside GPT-5.3-Codex + "Trusted Access for Cyber" pilot + $10M API credits for OSS cyber defense. Used to find vulns in projects like [[Next.js]]. Competitive landscape: [[Snyk]], [[Semgrep]], [[GitHub]] GHAS established; [[Anthropic]] and [[AWS]] security tools described as "demoware." Strategic significance: OpenAI moving beyond chatbot/API into enterprise security tooling, trying to own both code generation and code security. Peter Steinberger (@steipete) got access Feb 14: "quite a goated tool to find security vulnerabilities."

## Anthropic Skills platform

Added Skills platform section to [[Anthropic]] actor note + dedicated concept note **[[Claude Skills]]**. Skills are packaged instruction folders (`SKILL.md` + assets) that teach [[Claude]] reusable workflows — launched as an **open standard** (Dec 18, 2025). Guide published Jan 29, 2026 (32 pages). Skills API: `/v1/skills` endpoint, `container.skills` in Messages API. Works across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Partner directory: [[Asana]], [[Atlassian]], [[Canva]], [[Figma]], [[Sentry]], [[Zapier]]. Three-level progressive disclosure architecture (frontmatter always loaded → SKILL.md on match → references on demand). Five reusable patterns: sequential workflow, multi-MCP coordination, iterative refinement, context-aware tool selection, domain-specific intelligence. This completes Anthropic's platform stack: Models → [[MCP]] (connectivity) → Skills (knowledge) → Code Execution (environment). Competes with [[OpenAI]]'s custom GPTs/agent SDK but via open-standard portability rather than lock-in. Updated [[AI extensibility]] concept note Skills references.

## Chinese teapot refineries update

Updated [[Chinese teapot refineries]] with mid-2025 to early 2026 developments. Key additions: bankrupt teapots being acquired and restarted (Shandong Changyi Petrochemical resumed under Weifang Hongrun, two more in talks). Central-vs-local government tension — Beijing wants consolidation (Yulong Island megaproject) while Shandong province supports teapot survival with tax rebates. Consumption tax rebate reduction (Jan 2025, only 40-80% offset now, +$2/bbl). Only 27 of 49 Shandong teapots operational. 2026 crude import quota set at 257M metric tons (unchanged YoY). [[Rystad Energy]] flags potential pivot from [[Iran]]ian to Russian/Brazilian/Middle Eastern crude. Stub: [[Rystad Energy]].

## Mining supercycle / iron ore miners deep dive

Built out the iron ore mining complex across four notes. Key finding: [[Rio Tinto]] (+47% in 2025) and [[Vale]] (+82% 52-week) rally started fall 2025 and accelerated into 2026 — driven by [[Copper]] (~$6/lb, tripled from 2020), not [[Iron ore]] (~$101/t, weak). MSCI Metals & Mining Index +90% since start of 2025, beating semis, banks, Mag 7.

**[[Fortescue]]** — new full actor note. #4 iron ore globally, ~95% revenue concentration. Created from scratch with FY2023-2025 financials, four mining hubs, Iron Bridge magnetite ramp, green energy division (scaled back, ~$150M writedown), [[Alta Copper]] acquisition. Charts: FSUGY vs BHP/RIO/VALE peer comparison.

**[[BHP]]**, **[[Rio Tinto]]**, **[[Vale]]** — rewrote from stubs to full notes. Added phased rally timelines:
- Rio: Phase 1 (new CEO Trott, copper 883 kt exceeded guidance), Phase 2 ([[Glencore]] merger talks Jan 2026, collapsed Feb 6), Phase 3 (all-time highs, JPMorgan target 8,010 GBp)
- Vale: Phase 1 (Mariana $31.7B settlement Oct 2024), Phase 2 (record production — iron ore/copper/nickel all beat guidance highs), Phase 3 (BofA top pick, Q4 2025 EBITDA $4.8B +17% YoY, VBM EBITDA doubled to $1.4B)
- Common catalysts: copper breakout (US tariff stockpiling, AI/data center 475 kt, Grasberg force majeure), China 15th Five-Year Plan pivot to manufacturing/EVs, copper M&A wave, sector still at ~20% discount to long-term P/B

**[[Iron ore]]** — fleshed out concept note. Renamed "2026 rally" to "2026 outlook — weak prices, strong miners." Added TIO=F futures price chart ($220+ peak → ~$101/t). Fixed charting API to support futures tickers across `/api/chart/lw` and `/api/chart/image`.

**[[Copper]]** — added HG=F futures price chart ($2.10 → $6.00/lb) and "Miner re-rating" section with copper EBITDA comparison table (BHP ~45%, Rio ~15%, Vale not disclosed). Copper is the shared re-rating thesis across all three miners.

Supporting notes created/expanded: [[Andrew Forrest]], [[Minderoo Foundation]], [[Alta Copper]], [[Green hydrogen]].
