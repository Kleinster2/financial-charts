## India technology dependence — Bloomberg Opinion

[[India]]'s technology dependence on [[China]] undermining "Make in India" industrial policy.

Key developments:

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| [[Reliance Industries]] | Paused lithium-ion cell plans after [[Xiamen Hithium]] withdrew |
| Battery policy | ₹181B ($2B) for 50 GWh → only 1 GWh installed |
| Battery imports | $3B total, 75% from China (2.5x growth since 2018) |
| Rare earths | $800M magnet subsidies, skeptics doubt effectiveness |
| R&D gap | India 0.6% GDP (flat 27 years) vs China 2.5% |
| [[BYD]] in Nepal | 75% of Nepal cars are EVs, BYD is market leader |

Author thesis (Andy Mukherjee): While India-China relations are thawing (flights resumed, business visas streamlined), the détente is shallow. Beijing views India opportunistically as a market for excess Chinese production, not a technology partner. India's chronic R&D underinvestment (0.6% GDP flat since 1996) makes indigenous alternatives unrealistic.

Pattern: Same dynamic as [[Rare earth leverage]] — China built dominance through scale + subsidies, now restricts tech export to maintain leverage over clean energy transitions.

## Bloomberg: Circular Deals Underpinning the AI Boom

Bloomberg published an interactive explainer on circular deal structures in the AI ecosystem (Jan 22):

Core concept: Company A invests in Company B, which uses the capital to buy Company A's products. [[Microsoft]] ↔ [[OpenAI]], [[NVIDIA]] → AI labs → more GPU purchases, [[Amazon]] ↔ [[Anthropic]].

Bull case: Janus Henderson calls it a "virtuous circle" — locks in scarce chip supply by pairing purchase commitments with financing.

Bear case: If AI revenue disappoints, the flywheel reverses — cascading losses across interconnected players.

Telecom parallel: 1990s fiber-optic carriers did "capacity swaps" (selling each other network capacity, booking as revenue). Qwest and Global Crossing restated revenue after Congressional investigation. Paul Kedrosky: AI capex climbing toward late-1990s peak levels.

See [[AI infrastructure financing risk]] for full analysis.
