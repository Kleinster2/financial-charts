## Supreme Court strikes down IEEPA tariffs (6-3)

The [[Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA) **does not authorize the President to impose tariffs**, striking down Trump's most sweeping trade duties in a landmark 6-3 decision.

### The ruling

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Vote | **6-3** |
| Majority | [[John Roberts]] (author), [[Sonia Sotomayor]], [[Elena Kagan]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]], [[Ketanji Brown Jackson]] |
| Dissent | [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] |
| Key quote | "The Framers gave that power to 'Congress alone'" |

### Tariffs struck down vs surviving

| Struck down (IEEPA) | Survives |
|---------------------|----------|
| Reciprocal tariffs (10% baseline, up to 145% on China) | [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]] (25% on AI chips) |
| Canada 25% (fentanyl) | Section 232: steel, aluminum, autos, copper, trucks, lumber |
| Mexico 25% (fentanyl) | Section 301: China-specific product tariffs (25-100%) |
| Iran secondary tariffs (25%) | Existing MFN/antidumping duties |

**Effective tariff rate drops from 16.1% → 10.4%** with IEEPA tariffs removed.

### Fiscal impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IEEPA revenue collected (Feb 2025 – Feb 2026) | **$175-179B** (Penn-Wharton) |
| Daily IEEPA revenue | ~$500M/day |
| Potential refund liability | $175B+ |
| Comparison | Exceeds combined DOT ($127.6B) + DOJ ($44.9B) FY2025 budgets |

Importers expected to file refund claims with [[US Customs and Border Protection]]. Per Dec 2025 ruling, importers do not need separate lawsuits to preserve refund rights.

### What happens next

- **Admin response:** Will use Section 232, Section 301, Section 122 (150-day, 15% max), Section 338 (50% max, never used) to replace
- **JPMorgan trading desk:** 64% odds of "struck down + immediately replaced" — limiting net upside after initial spike
- **Bessent (earlier):** "What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level"
- **Congressional role:** Half a dozen Republicans voted with Democrats earlier this month to repeal Canada tariffs

### Market reaction

| Index | Move |
|-------|------|
| S&P 500 | **+0.4%** |
| Dow | **+0.4%** |
| Nasdaq | **+0.6%** |

Retail/apparel stocks surged: [[Victoria's Secret]] +5.6%, [[Dollar Tree]] +4%, [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] +5.5%, [[Nike]] rallied. Sector was hit hardest by IEEPA import duties in 2025.

### Same-day macro data (mixed)

| Indicator | Actual | Expected |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Q4 GDP (annualized) | **1.4%** | 2.9% |
| PCE headline (YoY) | **+2.9%** | lower |
| Core PCE (YoY) | **+3.0%** | lower |

Stagflationary read — weak growth + sticky inflation. UBS maintained positive US equity outlook citing Fed easing prospects.

### Vault implications

- [[US-China tariffs]] — reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs struck down; Section 301 remains
- [[Secondary sanctions]] — Iran tariff-based approach (IEEPA) now invalid
- [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]] — vindicated as IEEPA-proof authority
- [[Liberation Day tariffs]] — IEEPA-based, now struck down
- [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]] — dedicated event note
