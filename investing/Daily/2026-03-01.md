## Vault Activity

**Munitions Sector Research Completed**
- Created comprehensive sector note: [[Munitions]]
- Deep dive into [[155mm Shell Crisis]] - Ukraine war ammunition shortage analysis  
- Supply chain analysis: [[Munitions Supply Chain]] - bottlenecks and GOCO plants
- Research covered global market ($28-36B), key players (Rheinmetall, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Nammo, Hanwha), production capacity constraints, and investment implications
- Key finding: Ukraine's 356K rounds/month need vs NATO's inadequate production exposed strategic vulnerability
- Investment angle: Pure-play munitions companies (Rheinmetall €8.5B contracts) vs conglomerates with munitions divisions

**Autonomous Last-Mile Delivery Research**
- Created actor note: [[ZelosTech]] -- first L4 robovan unicorn ($1.4B), 20,000+ fleet post-Cainiao merger
- Created concept note: [[Autonomous Last-Mile Delivery]] -- thesis that logistics autonomy scales before passenger transport
- Key data: 10x annual fleet growth (200-2,000-20,000), operating breakeven ex-R&D, per-parcel cost halved to RMB 0.1
- ZelosTech-Cainiao merger (Jan 2026) established the scaling template: tech maker absorbs logistics platform demand channel
- $300M+ funding round (Feb 2026) at >RMB 10B valuation, six rounds totaling >$500M

## Notes

**NVIDIA Inference Platform (Groq LPU)**
- Updated [[Groq]] actor note with GTC 2026 inference platform reveal (WSJ, Feb 28)
- NVIDIA will unveil dedicated inference processor at GTC incorporating Groq's LPU chip
- [[OpenAI]] confirmed as one of the first and largest customers (for Codex/agentic coding)
- Strategic shift: NVIDIA moving from "GPUs do everything" to portfolio approach (GPU training + LPU decode + Vera CPU agents)
- Competitive context: OpenAI also signed multibillion-dollar deal with [[Cerebras]]; [[Anthropic]] runs on AWS/Google, not NVIDIA
- OpenAI also committed $30B to NVIDIA alongside this deal
