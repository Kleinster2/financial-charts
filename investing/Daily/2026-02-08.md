## AI Fear Grips Wall Street -- Bloomberg Market Wrap

Bloomberg's week-in-review on the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]]: AI disruption fears spilled from software into financial services and asset management, erasing $611B across 164 stocks in one week.

### Full-week damage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stocks hit | 164 (software, financial services, asset management) |
| Market cap erased | $611B |
| [[IGV]] (software ETF) | -12% over 4 sessions, Friday rebound |
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | -20% (steepest fall ever) |
| [[Morningstar]] | Worst week since 2009 |
| [[HubSpot]], [[Atlassian]], [[Zscaler]] | Each -16%+ |
| [[Salesforce]] | -48% from Dec 2024 high; 14x P/E (10yr avg: 46x) |
| [[ServiceNow]] | -57% from Jan 2025 peak |

### Positioning collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hedge fund net software exposure | Record low <3% (from 18% in 2023) |
| Software sector | Most net-sold YTD ([[Goldman Sachs]] PB) |
| GS software basket P/E | Record low 21x (from 100+ late 2021) |
| [[IGV]] RSI | 15 (lowest in ~15 years; <30 = oversold) |

### Fundamental disconnect

S&P 500 software/services earnings projected +19% for 2026 -- up from +16% months ago. No fundamental deterioration in results. Market is pricing disruption risk, not current weakness.

Catalysts: [[Anthropic]] Cowork plugins, [[Google DeepMind]] [[Genie 3]] (game dev selloff), [[Microsoft]] -$357B on cloud slowdown, [[ServiceNow]] and [[SAP]] earnings misses.

Dip-buying case: IGV RSI 15 = extreme oversold (threshold is 30). [[Salesforce]] at 14x forward P/E vs decade average of 46x. "We continue to test the valuation floor and then blow right through it" (KeyBanc analyst).

## Big Tech AI Capex to Exceed $660B — FT

[[AI capex arms race|Big Tech capex]] plans now total over **$660B** for 2026, forcing companies to raise tens of billions in fresh debt as spending outpaces even their enormous cash flows.

### Cash flow vs capex gap

| Company | 2026 capex guidance | Cash from ops (est.) | Gap |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----|
| [[Amazon]] | $200B | $180B | **-$20B** |
| [[Meta]] | $135B | $130B | **-$5B** |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] | $185B | $195B | +$10B (before buybacks/dividends) |

[[Amazon]] filed a regulatory notice Friday signaling it could raise fresh capital in debt or equity — shares closed -5.6%.

### Debt issuance surge

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| JPMorgan tech/media IG bond forecast (2026) | **$337B+** |
| TD Securities: expected IG issuance (week of Feb 10) | **$80B** (2x normal) |
| [[Oracle]] bond offering (Feb 3) | $25B (to fund $300B [[OpenAI]] deal) |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] long-term debt | $10.9B (2024) → **$46.5B** (2025) |
| US IG spreads | Widening in anticipation of supply |

BNP Paribas: free cash flows at [[Oracle]], [[Google\|Alphabet]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]] are "plummeting toward negative territory" — only [[Microsoft]] appears "more resilient, at least for now."

AJ Bell (Russ Mould): Big Tech is "moving from an asset-light business model to a more capital-intensive one." First signs: increased debt use and reduced share buyback programs.

## US Oil Majors Regaining Lustre as Software Sinks — FT

As [[AI workflow disruption basket|AI disruption]] hammers software valuations, capital is rotating into old-economy names. US energy sector up 17% YTD.

### US vs European oil majors

| Metric | US majors | European majors |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Combined market cap (12mo change) | +25% ([[Exxon]], [[Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]]) | Slightly behind ([[Shell]], [[BP]], [[TotalEnergies]], [[Eni]], [[Equinor]]) |
| Forward EV/EBITDA premium | US trades at >75% premium to EU | — |
| Net debt/equity | ~1/3 lower than Europeans ([[Goldman Sachs]]) | Higher leverage |
| Production growth (2024-2030E) | [[Exxon]] +6%/yr, [[Chevron]] +8%/yr | Flat as a group |

### Why stocks are rising despite weak [[Oil|oil]] prices

[[Oil]] prices down ~10% over 12 months, yet oil stocks diverging upward. [[Citigroup]] analysts: European oil stocks moved from pricing a "very negative terminal value" to "much less negative." The [[IEA]] now sees [[Oil|oil demand]] potentially growing until 2050 — peak oil keeps receding.

Key differentiators for US majors:
1. **Lower leverage** — dividends and buybacks more shielded
2. **Production growth** — Permian, Guyana volumes rising
3. **Reserve optionality** — Trump geopolitics ([[Venezuela]], Iran) could open new drilling opportunities

[[Shell]] announced $3.5B buyback (Thursday) — strong balance sheet relative to more geared European peers.
