## Markets

*Saturday — markets closed*

### Bottom line

The AI trade is bifurcating by quality. [[Credit markets|IG credit]] (76 bps) is absorbing $660B in Big Tech capex financing without stress — [[Google|Alphabet]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]] can borrow at will. But [[Credit markets|HY]] is cracking (+32 bps in 2 weeks) as software leveraged loans and second-tier players ([[Oracle]], [[CoreWeave]]) bear the disruption. Equity confirms: $611B wiped from software, energy +17% YTD, 43pp XLE-IGV divergence. Capital is rotating from asset-light to asset-heavy.

The paradox: Big Tech is simultaneously the *cause* of software disruption ([[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Cowork]], [[Genie 3]]) and the biggest borrower in [[Credit markets|credit markets]] to fund it. They're destroying the old economy while leveraging up to build the new one. The $660B bet works if AI revenue materializes before HY stress migrates upward.

## Saudi Arabia Unveils Updated Vision 2030 Strategy

[[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] entering a new phase — Finance Minister Al-Jadaan announced an updated 5-year strategy is being prepared. Focal areas: tourism, manufacturing, logistics, technology.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 actual deficit | 5.3% of GDP |
| 2026 deficit target | 3.3% (Wall Street skeptical) |
| 2026 financing needs | ~$58B |
| 2025 GDP growth | Fastest in 3 years |

Sharpened focus on spending efficiency after years of excess. Private capital and FDI becoming bigger priorities as mega-projects scale back (NEOM suspended, World Cup stadiums reduced). IMF calling for more clarity.

## AI Fear Grips Wall Street -- Bloomberg Market Wrap

Bloomberg's week-in-review on the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]]: AI disruption fears spilled from software into financial services and asset management, erasing $611B across 164 stocks in one week.

### Full-week damage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stocks hit | 164 (software, financial services, asset management) |
| Market cap erased | $611B |
| [[IGV]] (software ETF) | -12% over 4 sessions, Friday rebound |
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | -20% (steepest fall ever) |
| [[Morningstar]] | Worst week since 2009 |
| [[HubSpot]], [[Atlassian]], [[Zscaler]] | Each -16%+ |
| [[Salesforce]] | -48% from Dec 2024 high; 14x P/E (10yr avg: 46x) |
| [[ServiceNow]] | -57% from Jan 2025 peak |

### Positioning collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hedge fund net software exposure | Record low <3% (from 18% in 2023) |
| Software sector | Most net-sold YTD ([[Goldman Sachs]] PB) |
| GS software basket P/E | Record low 21x (from 100+ late 2021) |
| [[IGV]] RSI | 15 (lowest in ~15 years; <30 = oversold) |

### Fundamental disconnect

S&P 500 software/services earnings projected +19% for 2026 -- up from +16% months ago. No fundamental deterioration in results. Market is pricing disruption risk, not current weakness.

Catalysts: [[Anthropic]] Cowork plugins, [[Google DeepMind]] [[Genie 3]] (game dev selloff), [[Microsoft]] -$357B on cloud slowdown, [[ServiceNow]] and [[SAP]] earnings misses.

Dip-buying case: IGV RSI 15 = extreme oversold (threshold is 30). [[Salesforce]] at 14x forward P/E vs decade average of 46x. "We continue to test the valuation floor and then blow right through it" (KeyBanc analyst).

## Big Tech AI Capex to Exceed $660B — FT

[[AI capex arms race|Big Tech capex]] plans now total over **$660B** for 2026, forcing companies to raise tens of billions in fresh debt as spending outpaces even their enormous cash flows.

### Cash flow vs capex gap

| Company | 2026 capex guidance | Cash from ops (est.) | Gap |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----|
| [[Amazon]] | $200B | $180B | **-$20B** |
| [[Meta]] | $135B | $130B | **-$5B** |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] | $185B | $195B | +$10B (before buybacks/dividends) |

[[Amazon]] filed a regulatory notice Friday signaling it could raise fresh capital in debt or equity — shares closed -5.6%.

### Debt issuance surge

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| JPMorgan tech/media IG bond forecast (2026) | **$337B+** |
| TD Securities: expected IG issuance (week of Feb 10) | **$80B** (2x normal) |
| [[Oracle]] bond offering (Feb 3) | $25B (to fund $300B [[OpenAI]] deal) |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] long-term debt | $10.9B (2024) → **$46.5B** (2025) |
| US IG spreads | Widening in anticipation of supply |

### Credit spread snapshot (FRED, through Feb 5)

![[ig-vs-hy-spreads.png]]

*IG (blue) barely moving despite record TMT supply — market absorbing investment-grade issuance. HY (red) widening sharply as AI disruption fears hit lower-quality credits. The divergence is the signal: stress is concentrated in weaker names.*

| Spread | Latest (Feb 5) | Late Jan | Move |
|--------|---------------|----------|------|
| IG OAS ([[Credit markets\|BAMLC0A0CM]]) | 76 bps | 73 bps | +3 bps |
| HY OAS ([[Credit markets\|BAMLH0A0HYM2]]) | 297 bps | 265 bps | **+32 bps** |

HY widening driven by software leveraged loan repricing (-4% YTD) and BDC exposure (>20% software portfolios per [[Credit markets|Barclays]]).

BNP Paribas: free cash flows at [[Oracle]], [[Google\|Alphabet]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]] are "plummeting toward negative territory" — only [[Microsoft]] appears "more resilient, at least for now."

AJ Bell (Russ Mould): Big Tech is "moving from an asset-light business model to a more capital-intensive one." First signs: increased debt use and reduced share buyback programs.

## US Oil Majors Regaining Lustre as Software Sinks — FT

As [[AI workflow disruption basket|AI disruption]] hammers software valuations, capital is rotating into old-economy names. US energy sector up 17% YTD.

### US vs European oil majors

| Metric | US majors | European majors |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Combined market cap (12mo change) | +25% ([[Exxon]], [[Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]]) | Slightly behind ([[Shell]], [[BP]], [[TotalEnergies]], [[Eni]], [[Equinor]]) |
| Forward EV/EBITDA premium | US trades at >75% premium to EU | — |
| Net debt/equity | ~1/3 lower than Europeans ([[Goldman Sachs]]) | Higher leverage |
| Production growth (2024-2030E) | [[Exxon]] +6%/yr, [[Chevron]] +8%/yr | Flat as a group |

### Why stocks are rising despite weak [[Oil|oil]] prices

[[Oil]] prices down ~10% over 12 months, yet oil stocks diverging upward. [[Citigroup]] analysts: European oil stocks moved from pricing a "very negative terminal value" to "much less negative." The [[IEA]] now sees [[Oil|oil demand]] potentially growing until 2050 — peak oil keeps receding.

Key differentiators for US majors:
1. **Lower leverage** — dividends and buybacks more shielded
2. **Production growth** — Permian, Guyana volumes rising
3. **Reserve optionality** — Trump geopolitics ([[Venezuela]], Iran) could open new drilling opportunities

[[Shell]] announced $3.5B buyback (Thursday) — strong balance sheet relative to more geared European peers.

![[xle-vs-igv-price-chart.png]]
*Energy vs software, last 90 days: ~43pp divergence. Steady drift apart from November, then violent acceleration in February as SaaSpocalypse capital rotates from asset-light to asset-heavy.*

### Historical pattern: energy as tech-bust beneficiary

This is the third time energy has been a major [[Sector rotation|rotation]] beneficiary when a tech narrative breaks:

| Episode | Divergence (XLE vs QQQ) | Duration |
|---------|------------------------|----------|
| 2000-02 (dot-com) | ~70pp | 2+ years |
| 2022 (Fed hiking) | ~85pp | 1 year |
| 2026 (SaaSpocalypse) | ~43pp | Ongoing |

See [[Sector rotation]] for charts of each episode. Open question: is the 2026 rotation still early (2000 and 2022 both went further) or structurally different (AI disruption is a one-off catalyst, not a cycle)?

| [[Software bear market]] | GS basket at record low 21x P/E, IGV RSI 15 (extreme oversold) | ↓↓ Could be capitulation |
| [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026]] | Damage wider than initial $285B -- now $611B across full week | ↓ Cascade continues |
| [[Oil]] / peak oil demand | IEA now sees demand potentially growing until 2050; terminal value repricing | ↑ Longevity thesis strengthening |
