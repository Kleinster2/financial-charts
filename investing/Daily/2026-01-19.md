## Research themes

### Bank cronyism as terminal phase

Central thesis developed today: bank cronyism isn't just a feature of mature regimes — it's the **terminal phase**. The extraction progression:

| Phase | Years | Method |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Early | 0-15 | Licenses, permits, contracts |
| Middle | 15-30 | State enterprises, privatization |
| Terminal | 30-45+ | Banking system capture |

**Why banking is terminal:**
- Requires total institutional capture
- Extracts from stock (savings) not flow (activity)
- Destroys the middle class base
- Maximum socialization of losses

### Key parallels added

1. **Corruption scandals:** Mensalão/Petrolão vs Khosravi/Zanjani/IRGC privatization — Brazil prosecutes then voids; Iran skips the theater

2. **Regime congealing:** Both had reform windows (FHC 1995-2002 / Khatami 1997-2005) that closed; brief technical reopenings (Temer / Rouhani) failed

3. **Professional classes:** Bacharéis = clerics (ideological cover); police = IRGC/Basij (coercion); protected industrialists = IRGC companies (gatekeeping)

4. **Political dynasties:** Nothing rotates — Sarney 60 years, Khamenei 36 years, same families since founding

## US-EU trade tensions

### Greenland pressure triggering EU response

Trump's [[Greenland]] annexation push — including tariff threats against opposing countries — has frozen the [[US-EU trade|Turnberry Agreement]] and raised prospect of EU retaliation.

**Timeline:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Apr 2, 2025 | [[Liberation Day tariffs]] — US announces high tariffs on EU |
| Jul 27, 2025 | [[Turnberry Agreement]] — asymmetric deal (US 15%, EU 0%) |
| Jan 2026 | EU freezes Turnberry; threatens retaliation |
| Feb 1, 2026 | Threatened: 10% on 6 EU countries + Norway + UK |
| Jun 1, 2026 | Threatened: 25% escalation |

**EU retaliation list (~€93B):**
- Boeing aircraft (alternative: Airbus)
- Soy (alternative: Brazil/Argentina)
- Whiskey, motorcycles (Trump voter industries)

**Anti-Coercion Instrument:** Created 2023, never used. Macron suggesting activation — would enable IP restrictions and market access blocks beyond tariffs.

**WTO:** Dispute settlement system paralyzed by US actions. Turnberry itself violates WTO MFN principle.

**Silver lining:** May accelerate EU-Mercosur ratification as EU seeks alternatives.
