## Markets

*Thursday — heavy earnings day (205 reports). Futures modestly higher despite CSCO drag. Prior close (Feb 11): Dow 50,121 (-0.13%), S&P 6,941 (flat), Nasdaq 23,066 (-0.16%) — strong Jan jobs report (+130K, nearly 2x est) offset by massive 2025 revision (-403K, weakest since 2003 ex-recession). CPI tomorrow.*

| Index | Prior Close (Feb 11) | Futures (Feb 12) |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| Dow | 50,121.40 (-0.13%) | +0.3% |

[[Vertiv]] +24% prior session (Q4 beat + strong 2026 outlook). [[Zillow]] -17% prior session.

After close today: [[Applied Materials]], [[Arista Networks]], [[Coinbase]], [[Airbnb]], [[Rivian]], [[Roku]]. Results pending — will update when available.

Macro: Jan jobs +130K (est 55K), unemployment 4.3% (est 4.4%). But 2025 full-year payrolls revised down to 181K from 584K previously — weakest annual job growth since 2003 outside recession. Markets pricing ~40% probability of Fed holding rates steady. Jan CPI due Friday — key for rate path.

## Anthropic $20B+ Series G closes — Founders Fund, D.E. Shaw, Dragoneer co-lead

[[Anthropic]] is closing its $20B+ Series G at a $350B valuation — nearly doubling from $183B just five months ago. Bloomberg reported the co-lead investor details today:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round | Series G |
| Size | $20B+ |
| Valuation | $350B |
| Co-leads | [[Founders Fund]], [[D.E. Shaw]], [[Dragoneer]], [[Iconiq]], [[MGX]] |
| Strategic | [[NVIDIA]] (~$10B), [[Microsoft]] (~$5B) |
| Other investors | [[Coatue]], [[GIC]], [[Altimeter]], [[Sequoia]], [[Lightspeed]], [[Menlo Ventures]] |
| Total raised | ~$60B+ |

This is one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The round was originally sized at $10B but doubled on excess demand. [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Founders Fund]] and [[D.E. Shaw]] joining as co-leads is notable — both are new to Anthropic's cap table. [[D.E. Shaw]] is better known as a quant hedge fund; this signals conviction in frontier AI as an asset class beyond traditional VC.

Revenue run rate surpassed $9B last summer. Total raised now pushes to ~$60B ahead of a potential IPO. [[OpenAI]] is reportedly assembling a $100B round — the AI arms race in capital markets is unprecedented.

## RELX FY2025 — revenue £9.59B (+7%), margin expansion, £2.25B buyback

[[RELX]] reported strong full-year 2025 results, defying the [[AI disintermediation]] selloff that hit peers like [[Thomson Reuters]] (-20%):

| Metric | FY 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | £9,590M | +7% underlying |
| Adj operating profit | £3,342M | +9% |
| Adj operating margin | 34.8% | +90bps (from 33.9%) |
| Adj EPS | 128.5p | +10% cc |
| Free cash flow | £2,313M | +9% |
| Cash conversion | 99% | — |
| Dividend | 67.5p | +7% |
| Share buyback (2025) | £1,500M | — |
| Share buyback (2026 plan) | £2,250M | +50% |

Segment performance:

| Segment | Growth | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Risk | +8% | Insurance, identity verification |
| Legal | +9% | [[LexisNexis]] strength |
| STM | +5% | Elsevier, research |
| Exhibitions | +8% | Trade shows recovery |

Electronic revenue now 84% of total. Five acquisitions for £270M. Net debt/EBITDA 2.0x.

Stock +1.4% — resilient vs SaaSpocalypse. The £2.25B 2026 buyback (above analyst expectations of £1.75B) signals management confidence. RELX's data moat in legal/risk analytics is harder to replicate than commodity SaaS — this is the "data" factor from Fortune's SaaSpocalypse framework (see below).

## Brookfield Corp (BN) Q4 2025 — record DE $5.4B, $188B deployable capital, 17% dividend hike

[[Brookfield]] reported record results and launched an inaugural AI infrastructure fund:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Net income (to shareholders) | $743M | $1.3B |
| DE before realizations | $1.5B ($0.63/sh) | $5.4B ($2.27/sh, +11%) |
| Total DE | $1.6B ($0.67/sh) | $6.0B ($2.54/sh) |
| Fee-bearing capital | — | $603B (+12%) |
| Fee-related earnings | — | $3.0B (+22%) |
| Capital raised | — | $112B |
| Monetizations | — | $91B |
| Deployable capital | — | $188B (record) |

Capital allocation:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Dividend increase | +17% to $0.28/yr |
| Share buybacks (2025) | $1B+ at avg $36/sh |
| Credit rating | A- (all majors) |
| Corporate debt WAL | 15 years |
| Unrealized carried interest | $11.6B |

Division highlights:
- Asset management: Fee-bearing capital $603B (+12%), fee-related earnings $3.0B (+22%)
- Wealth Solutions: DE $1.7B, annuity sales $20B, insurance assets $143B
- Operating businesses: DE $1.6B, real estate occupancy 96% (super core)

Key signal: Brookfield launched its inaugural AI infrastructure fund during 2025. Combined with the $188B of deployable capital, this positions Brookfield as a major allocator to AI buildout. Relevant to [[ALTM]] basket thesis — alt managers are not intermediaries being disrupted, they're capital deployers benefiting from AI infrastructure demand.

## Unity (U) crashes 26% — Q4 beat, Q1 guide missed, Google Genie 3 fear

[[Unity Technologies]] stock crashed ~26% in premarket despite beating Q4 estimates, as Q1 2026 guidance disappointed and AI competition fears intensified:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $503.1M | +10% |
| Adj EPS | $0.24 | Beat $0.21 est |
| Create Solutions | $165M | +8% |
| Grow Solutions | $338M | +11% |

Q1 2026 guidance (the problem):

| Metric | Q1 Guide | vs Street |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | $480-490M | Below $492M est |
| Adj EBITDA | $105-110M | Below $116.9M est |

Stock down 52% YTD. The selloff was compounded by [[Google]]'s [[Genie 3]] — an AI tool that generates interactive 3D environments from text prompts, threatening Unity's core game engine business. This is the SaaSpocalypse hitting gaming infrastructure.

Unity Vector platform on track for $1B quarterly run rate by end-2026. Refinanced $690M of 2026 convertibles to 2030. Cash position >$2B. The operational turnaround is real, but the market is pricing in existential AI risk to the game engine model.

## Micron (MU) +10% — HBM4 shipping a year ahead of schedule

[[Micron]] sparked a global semiconductor rally after CFO Mark Murphy announced at the Wolfe Research Conference that [[HBM|HBM4]] is in mass production and shipping to customers a full year ahead of schedule:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announcement | HBM4 mass production + shipping |
| Timeline | One year ahead of schedule |
| NVIDIA status | Murphy denied exclusion rumors — supply chain intact |
| Stock close | $410.34 (+9.94%) |
| Market cap | $461.8B |
| After-hours | $415.48 (+1.25%) |

Global ripple effects:

| Stock | Move |
|-------|------|
| [[Samsung]] | +1.97% |
| [[SK Hynix]] | +2.67% |
| Hanmi Semiconductor | +5.25% |
| VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) | +2.71% |
| Philadelphia Semiconductor Index | +2.28% |

Analyst upgrades: TD Cowen raised to Street-high $600 PT, Deutsche Bank $500, Morgan Stanley $450.

This is a major HBM milestone. Micron was widely seen as #3 behind [[SK Hynix]] and [[Samsung]] in [[HBM]] — shipping HBM4 early narrows that gap significantly. The denial of [[NVIDIA]] supply chain exclusion was equally important — rumors had dogged the stock.

ByteDance reportedly in talks with Samsung to co-develop AI chips — another catalyst for the memory complex.

## Alphabet ~$32B bond sale — largest tech debt raise ever, 100-year bond

[[Google|Alphabet]] raised ~$32B in debt in under 24 hours across three currencies, the largest tech bond sale in history:

| Tranche | Size | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| US Dollar | $20B | 7-part, 3yr to 40yr maturities |
| Sterling | £1B+ | Includes 100-year bond (first tech century bond since [[Motorola]] 1997) |
| Swiss Franc | — | Largest-ever CHF corporate bond |
| Total | ~$32B | — |

Order book: >$100B in demand at peak — among strongest ever for corporate bonds. USD tranche upsized from initial $15B plan. 100-year bond drew ~10x oversubscription.

Why Alphabet is borrowing: AI capex guided at $185B for 2026 (~2x 2025). Even with $126B cash on hand, the scale of AI buildout requires debt. Long-term debt quadrupled in 2025 to $46.5B.

Risk disclosures: Alphabet acknowledged potential "excess capacity" from AI investments and highlighted AI's potential impact on its core advertising business — a rare self-assessment of disruption risk.

Market context: [[Oracle]] raised $25B last week. [[Meta]] preparing a large debt offering. Morgan Stanley estimates tech hyperscalers will borrow ~$400B in 2026, more than double 2025's $165B. Could push total US investment-grade issuance to a record $2.25T in 2026.

## Cisco (CSCO) -7% premarket — margin guidance disappoints despite Q2 beat

[[Cisco]] shares fell ~7% in premarket Thursday despite beating on both lines in Q2 FY2026 (reported after close Feb 11, covered in yesterday's daily note):

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Q3 guide: adj EPS | $1.02-1.04 (in line with $1.03 est) |
| Q3 guide: revenue | $15.4-15.6B (above $15.18B est) |
| Non-GAAP gross margin | 67.5% (below 68.1% est) |
| Concern | Rising memory costs squeezing margins |

The market wanted margin expansion, not just revenue growth. Even with $2.1B in AI infrastructure orders from hyperscalers and 21% networking growth, the gross margin miss suggests profitability headwinds from the AI transition — more compute-intensive products carry different margin profiles.

## Nebius (NBIS) Q4 — EPS missed, revenue ramp continues

[[Nebius]] reported Q4 2025 results this morning:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| EPS | -$0.684 | Missed -$0.54 est (-26.7%) |
| Revenue | — | +$189.8M YoY |
| Stock | $91.00 | +2.7% |

CEO [[Arkady Volozh]] targeting $7-9B annualized revenue run rate by end-2026. Plans to increase contracted capacity to 2.5 GW (from 1 GW discussed previously). Prior quarter signed $3B [[Meta]] contract and $17-19B [[Microsoft]] deal.

The EPS miss matters less than the trajectory — Nebius is in hypergrowth mode, spending aggressively on GPU infrastructure. The [[Tavily]] acquisition ($275M, covered yesterday) adds agentic search capability to the AI cloud platform.

## SaaSpocalypse meta-narrative — Fortune's 3 factors, Thoma Bravo as buyer, $2T+ wipeout

The [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative deepened today with three major developments:

### Fortune's 3 factors separating winners from losers (Feb 12)

| Factor | Winners | Losers |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 1. Data moats | Companies managing sensitive/regulated data (payroll, security) | Commodity SaaS with replicate-able UI |
| 2. Pricing model | Usage-based pricing (grows with AI adoption) | Seat-based pricing (shrinks as AI replaces users) |
| 3. Cost discipline | Fair pricing relative to value | Aggressive price increases above inflation |

[[Rocket Software]] CEO Milan Shetti: "We have usage-based pricing, not seat-based pricing. The SaaS companies with user-based pricing have taken a hit, because if AI improves productivity, the number of users goes down."

[[Palantir]] CEO [[Alex Karp]]: AI should reduce IT costs — yet SaaS vendors keep raising prices above inflation.

[[Workday]] co-founder [[Aneel Bhusri]] returning as CEO to address the challenge. [[Salesforce]], [[Oracle]], [[Asana]], [[DocuSign]], [[Intuit]] all cited as under pressure.

### Thoma Bravo seeking bargains (Feb 11)

[[Thoma Bravo]] managing partner Holden Spaht on Bloomberg: "To think that all software is the same, they're missing the mark a bit. We think this could be a really exceptional buying opportunity."

Software P/S ratios compressed from 9x to 6x — levels not seen since mid-2010s. Thoma Bravo has been on an acquisition spree: Boeing Digital Aviation ($10.55B), Olo ($2B), [[Dayforce]] ($12.3B), [[Verint]] ($2B).

Troubling detail: January 2026 layoffs at acquired companies reportedly hit 40-50% of staff.

### Bloomberg "AI scare trade" widens (Feb 11)

The selloff has expanded from software to wealth management, real estate services, and financial data. S&P 500 software and services index -26% from late-October peak. >$1T in market cap destroyed. IPO window shuttered — Blackstone-backed [[Liftoff Mobile]] pulled.

JPMorgan: software stocks are being "sentenced before trial." Goldman Sachs CEO [[David Solomon]]: selloff was "too broad."

## Equinix (EQIX) Q4 — record bookings, 60% AI-driven, 2026 guide $10.1-10.2B

[[Equinix]] reported record Q4 bookings driven by AI workloads:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $2,420M | $9,217M (+5%) |
| Adj EBITDA | — | $4,530M (49% margin) |
| AFFO | — | $3,761M (+12%) |
| AFFO/share | — | $38.33 (+9%) |
| Gross bookings | $474M (record, +42%) | $1,600M (+27%) |
| Interconnections | 500,000+ | — |
| AI % of large deals | ~60% | Up from ~50% earlier in year |

2026 guidance:

| Metric | 2026 Guide |
|--------|------------|
| Revenue | $10.1-10.2B (+10-11%) |
| Adj EBITDA | $5.1-5.2B (~51% margin) |
| AFFO/share | $41.93-42.74 (+9-12%) |
| Capex | $3.7-4.2B |
| Dividend | +10% (11th consecutive year) |

52 expansion projects underway across 14 metros. Added ~1 GW of powered land-under-control. xScale JV planning $15B capital deployment.

Stock +8.6% — the AI data center buildout is the tide lifting Equinix. 60% of largest deals now AI-driven (up from ~50%) confirms accelerating demand mix shift.

## Paycom (PAYC) -8% — 2026 guide misses, SaaSpocalypse victim

[[Paycom]] beat Q4 EPS by $0.01 but 2026 revenue guidance disappointed:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| EPS | $2.45 (beat $2.44 est) | — |
| Revenue | $517.1M (+10.2% YoY) | — |

2026 guidance: $2.175-2.195B revenue (6-7% growth) — well below the growth rate investors expected. Stock down 41% over 12 months. Hit 52-week low of ~$118.

BMO cut PT to $137 (from $175), Barclays to $185 (from $210), Weiss downgraded to Sell.

Paycom is a textbook SaaSpocalypse victim — HCM/payroll is seat-based pricing, and AI agents promise to automate HR workflows. But payroll specifically may have more defensibility (Fortune's "data" factor — regulatory complexity, sensitive data).

## Rollins (ROL) -15% — Q4 misses on both lines

[[Rollins]] (pest control) missed Q4 estimates:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | vs Est |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $912.9M (+9.7% YoY) | Missed $927.7M |
| EPS | $0.25 | Missed $0.27 |
| Adj EBITDA | $193.7M | Missed $209M |

Management blamed weather. Operating cash flow -12.4% YoY. Stock -15% premarket. Not an AI story — this is pure operational miss in a defensive services company.

## Vertiv (VRT) +24% — Q4 beat, 2026 outlook crushes estimates (Feb 11)

[[Vertiv]] surged ~24% after blowout Q4 results and 2026 guidance that left analysts far behind:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $2.88B (in line) | $10.23B (+26% organic) |
| Adj EPS | $1.36 (beat $1.29) | $4.20 (+47%) |
| Orders | +252% organic YoY | — |
| Backlog | $15B | — |
| Book-to-bill | ~2.9x | — |
| Adj operating margin | 23.2% (+170bps) | 20.4% (+100bps) |
| Adj free cash flow | — | $1.89B (+66%) |

2026 guidance:

| Metric | 2026 Guide | vs Street |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Revenue | $13.25-13.75B | Street $12.39B (~$1.4B gap) |
| Adj EPS | $5.97-6.07 | — |
| Adj operating profit | $3.04B (+45%) | — |
| Adj operating margin | 22.5% (+210bps) | — |

Stock up 1,300% since end-2022 (~$70B market value created). The $15B backlog and 2.9x book-to-bill confirm AI data center power/cooling demand is accelerating, not plateauing. Vertiv is the picks-and-shovels play for the physical layer of AI infrastructure.

## Zillow (ZG) -17% — EPS missed by $0.41, cash flow deterioration (Feb 11)

[[Zillow]] dropped ~17% despite beating on revenue:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $654M (+18%) | Beat $650M est |
| EPS | $0.01 | Missed $0.42 est (by $0.41) |
| Adj EBITDA | $149M | Missed $151.5M est |
| FCF margin | 6.7% | Down from 15.9% |

Segment: Residential +8% ($418M), mortgage +39% ($57M), rentals +45% ($168M). Q1 guide: $700-710M (above $690M est). Cash flow deterioration the key concern — FCF margin halved. Legal expenses reducing adj EBITDA margin by 2pp in Q1. Stock hit 52-week low $51.85, down 30.9% YTD. Goldman cut PT to $62, Cantor to $56. Also in the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] crosshairs — real estate services the latest sector facing AI scare trade selling.

## Richard Attias & Associates — banks selected for ~$1B IPO

[[Richard Attias & Associates]] (RA&A), the organizer of the [[Future Investment Initiative]] summit ("Davos in the Desert"), has selected banks including [[Evercore]] for an IPO that could value the events firm at ~$1B. [[Sanabil]] (a [[Saudi PIF]] subsidiary) owns ~75%; founder Richard Attias holds the rest. The deal could come as early as 2026.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Company | Richard Attias & Associates |
| Valuation | ~$1B |
| Majority owner | [[Sanabil]] (~75%, [[Saudi PIF]] sub) |
| Adviser | [[Evercore]] + others |
| Key event | [[Future Investment Initiative]] |
| Offices | 6 (NYC, Paris, Riyadh, Dubai, Dakar, Beijing) |
| Employees | 120+ |

RA&A has organized FII since 2017. The IPO is partly a [[Tadawul]] capital markets development play — more Saudi listings, more foreign investor access. The question is whether a single-event franchise (however prestigious) justifies $1B.

## Zhipu (2513.HK) +30% — GLM-5 launch + JPMorgan Overweight initiation

[[Zhipu]] surged ~30% to HK$405 ($51.80), hitting a record high and pushing market cap to ~$19B — nearly 3x the $6.6B IPO valuation from five weeks ago. Two catalysts converged:

### JPMorgan initiation (Feb 10)

[[JPMorgan]] analyst Olivia Xu initiated coverage at Overweight with HK$400 price target. Also initiated [[MiniMax]] at Overweight (HK$700 PT). [[Goldman Sachs]] initiated around the same time.

| Metric | JPMorgan view |
|--------|---------------|
| Rating | Overweight |
| Target | HK$400 |

JPMorgan argues China's AI market is consolidating from 200+ model developers to <10 — Zhipu and MiniMax positioned to survive as independent foundation model labs.

### GLM-5 release (Feb 11-12)

| Metric | GLM-5 | GLM-4.7 |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Parameters | 744B | 355B |
| Training data | 28.5T tokens | — |
| Architecture | DeepSeek Sparse Attention | — |

Claims to approach [[Claude]] Opus 4.5 on coding benchmarks and surpass [[Google]] Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. Topped open-source leaderboard on Artificial Analysis. Framed as shift from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering."

### Pricing power signal

Zhipu hiked GLM Coding Plan prices by 30%+ citing rapid user growth. Base plan still ~20 yuan/month (~$3) — 1/7 the price of Claude Pro.

### Financials context (from IPO prospectus)

| Period | Revenue (RMB) | Net loss (RMB) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 2022 | 57.4M | (143.7M) |
| 2023 | 124.5M | (788.0M) |
| 2024 | 312.4M | (2,958.0M) |
| H1 2025 | 190.9M | (2,357.9M) |

R&D burn at 7-8x revenue. Cloud gross margin collapsed from 76.1% (2022) to -0.4% (H1 2025) under [[DeepSeek]] pricing pressure. On-prem/privatized cloud is 84.5% of revenue — the stickier, higher-margin business. Trading at ~150x 2024 P/S, ~39x 2025E.

Stock up ~249% from IPO in 5 weeks. The question is whether this is [[MiniMax]]/[[Biren Tech]]-style momentum or a durable re-rating backed by the consolidation thesis.
