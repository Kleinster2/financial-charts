## Anthropic $20B+ Series G closes — Founders Fund, D.E. Shaw, Dragoneer co-lead

[[Anthropic]] is closing its $20B+ Series G at a $350B valuation — nearly doubling from $183B just five months ago. Bloomberg reported the co-lead investor details today:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round | Series G |
| Size | $20B+ |
| Valuation | $350B |
| Co-leads | [[Founders Fund]], [[D.E. Shaw]], [[Dragoneer]], [[Iconiq]], [[MGX]] |
| Strategic | [[NVIDIA]] (~$10B), [[Microsoft]] (~$5B) |
| Other investors | [[Coatue]], [[GIC]], [[Altimeter]], [[Sequoia]], [[Lightspeed]], [[Menlo Ventures]] |
| Total raised | ~$60B+ |

This is one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The round was originally sized at $10B but doubled on excess demand. [[Peter Thiel]]'s [[Founders Fund]] and [[D.E. Shaw]] joining as co-leads is notable — both are new to Anthropic's cap table. [[D.E. Shaw]] is better known as a quant hedge fund; this signals conviction in frontier AI as an asset class beyond traditional VC.

Revenue run rate surpassed $9B last summer. Total raised now pushes to ~$60B ahead of a potential IPO. [[OpenAI]] is reportedly assembling a $100B round — the AI arms race in capital markets is unprecedented.

## RELX FY2025 — revenue £9.59B (+7%), margin expansion, £2.25B buyback

[[RELX]] reported strong full-year 2025 results, defying the [[AI disintermediation]] selloff that hit peers like [[Thomson Reuters]] (-20%):

| Metric | FY 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | £9,590M | +7% underlying |
| Adj operating profit | £3,342M | +9% |
| Adj operating margin | 34.8% | +90bps (from 33.9%) |
| Adj EPS | 128.5p | +10% cc |
| Free cash flow | £2,313M | +9% |
| Cash conversion | 99% | — |
| Dividend | 67.5p | +7% |
| Share buyback (2025) | £1,500M | — |
| Share buyback (2026 plan) | £2,250M | +50% |

Segment performance:

| Segment | Growth | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Risk | +8% | Insurance, identity verification |
| Legal | +9% | [[LexisNexis]] strength |
| STM | +5% | Elsevier, research |
| Exhibitions | +8% | Trade shows recovery |

Electronic revenue now 84% of total. Five acquisitions for £270M. Net debt/EBITDA 2.0x.

Stock +1.4% — resilient vs SaaSpocalypse. The £2.25B 2026 buyback (above analyst expectations of £1.75B) signals management confidence. RELX's data moat in legal/risk analytics is harder to replicate than commodity SaaS — this is the "data" factor from Fortune's SaaSpocalypse framework (see below).

## Brookfield Corp (BN) Q4 2025 — record DE $5.4B, $188B deployable capital, 17% dividend hike

[[Brookfield]] reported record results and launched an inaugural AI infrastructure fund:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Net income (to shareholders) | $743M | $1.3B |
| DE before realizations | $1.5B ($0.63/sh) | $5.4B ($2.27/sh, +11%) |
| Total DE | $1.6B ($0.67/sh) | $6.0B ($2.54/sh) |
| Fee-bearing capital | — | $603B (+12%) |
| Fee-related earnings | — | $3.0B (+22%) |
| Capital raised | — | $112B |
| Monetizations | — | $91B |
| Deployable capital | — | $188B (record) |

Capital allocation:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Dividend increase | +17% to $0.28/yr |
| Share buybacks (2025) | $1B+ at avg $36/sh |
| Credit rating | A- (all majors) |
| Corporate debt WAL | 15 years |
| Unrealized carried interest | $11.6B |

Division highlights:
- Asset management: Fee-bearing capital $603B (+12%), fee-related earnings $3.0B (+22%)
- Wealth Solutions: DE $1.7B, annuity sales $20B, insurance assets $143B
- Operating businesses: DE $1.6B, real estate occupancy 96% (super core)

Key signal: Brookfield launched its inaugural AI infrastructure fund during 2025. Combined with the $188B of deployable capital, this positions Brookfield as a major allocator to AI buildout. Relevant to [[ALTM]] basket thesis — alt managers are not intermediaries being disrupted, they're capital deployers benefiting from AI infrastructure demand.

## Unity (U) crashes 26% — Q4 beat, Q1 guide missed, Google Genie 3 fear

[[Unity Technologies]] stock crashed ~26% in premarket despite beating Q4 estimates, as Q1 2026 guidance disappointed and AI competition fears intensified:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $503.1M | +10% |
| Adj EPS | $0.24 | Beat $0.21 est |
| Create Solutions | $165M | +8% |
| Grow Solutions | $338M | +11% |

Q1 2026 guidance (the problem):

| Metric | Q1 Guide | vs Street |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | $480-490M | Below $492M est |
| Adj EBITDA | $105-110M | Below $116.9M est |

Stock down 52% YTD. The selloff was compounded by [[Google]]'s [[Genie 3]] — an AI tool that generates interactive 3D environments from text prompts, threatening Unity's core game engine business. This is the SaaSpocalypse hitting gaming infrastructure.

Unity Vector platform on track for $1B quarterly run rate by end-2026. Refinanced $690M of 2026 convertibles to 2030. Cash position >$2B. The operational turnaround is real, but the market is pricing in existential AI risk to the game engine model.

## Micron (MU) +10% — HBM4 shipping a year ahead of schedule

[[Micron]] sparked a global semiconductor rally after CFO Mark Murphy announced at the Wolfe Research Conference that [[HBM|HBM4]] is in mass production and shipping to customers a full year ahead of schedule:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announcement | HBM4 mass production + shipping |
| Timeline | One year ahead of schedule |
| NVIDIA status | Murphy denied exclusion rumors — supply chain intact |
| Stock close | $410.34 (+9.94%) |
| Market cap | $461.8B |
| After-hours | $415.48 (+1.25%) |

Global ripple effects:

| Stock | Move |
|-------|------|
| [[Samsung]] | +1.97% |
| [[SK Hynix]] | +2.67% |
| Hanmi Semiconductor | +5.25% |
| VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) | +2.71% |
| Philadelphia Semiconductor Index | +2.28% |

Analyst upgrades: TD Cowen raised to Street-high $600 PT, Deutsche Bank $500, Morgan Stanley $450.

This is a major HBM milestone. Micron was widely seen as #3 behind [[SK Hynix]] and [[Samsung]] in [[HBM]] — shipping HBM4 early narrows that gap significantly. The denial of [[NVIDIA]] supply chain exclusion was equally important — rumors had dogged the stock.

ByteDance reportedly in talks with Samsung to co-develop AI chips — another catalyst for the memory complex.

## Alphabet ~$32B bond sale — largest tech debt raise ever, 100-year bond

[[Google|Alphabet]] raised ~$32B in debt in under 24 hours across three currencies, the largest tech bond sale in history:

| Tranche | Size | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| US Dollar | $20B | 7-part, 3yr to 40yr maturities |
| Sterling | £1B+ | Includes 100-year bond (first tech century bond since [[Motorola]] 1997) |
| Swiss Franc | — | Largest-ever CHF corporate bond |
| Total | ~$32B | — |

Order book: >$100B in demand at peak — among strongest ever for corporate bonds. USD tranche upsized from initial $15B plan. 100-year bond drew ~10x oversubscription.

Why Alphabet is borrowing: AI capex guided at $185B for 2026 (~2x 2025). Even with $126B cash on hand, the scale of AI buildout requires debt. Long-term debt quadrupled in 2025 to $46.5B.

Risk disclosures: Alphabet acknowledged potential "excess capacity" from AI investments and highlighted AI's potential impact on its core advertising business — a rare self-assessment of disruption risk.

Market context: [[Oracle]] raised $25B last week. [[Meta]] preparing a large debt offering. Morgan Stanley estimates tech hyperscalers will borrow ~$400B in 2026, more than double 2025's $165B. Could push total US investment-grade issuance to a record $2.25T in 2026.

## Cisco (CSCO) -7% premarket — margin guidance disappoints despite Q2 beat

[[Cisco]] shares fell ~7% in premarket Thursday despite beating on both lines in Q2 FY2026 (reported after close Feb 11, covered in yesterday's daily note):

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Q3 guide: adj EPS | $1.02-1.04 (in line with $1.03 est) |
| Q3 guide: revenue | $15.4-15.6B (above $15.18B est) |
| Non-GAAP gross margin | 67.5% (below 68.1% est) |
| Concern | Rising memory costs squeezing margins |

The market wanted margin expansion, not just revenue growth. Even with $2.1B in AI infrastructure orders from hyperscalers and 21% networking growth, the gross margin miss suggests profitability headwinds from the AI transition — more compute-intensive products carry different margin profiles.

## Nebius (NBIS) Q4 — EPS missed, revenue ramp continues

[[Nebius]] reported Q4 2025 results this morning:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| EPS | -$0.684 | Missed -$0.54 est (-26.7%) |
| Revenue | — | +$189.8M YoY |
| Stock | $91.00 | +2.7% |

CEO [[Arkady Volozh]] targeting $7-9B annualized revenue run rate by end-2026. Plans to increase contracted capacity to 2.5 GW (from 1 GW discussed previously). Prior quarter signed $3B [[Meta]] contract and $17-19B [[Microsoft]] deal.

The EPS miss matters less than the trajectory — Nebius is in hypergrowth mode, spending aggressively on GPU infrastructure. The [[Tavily]] acquisition ($275M, covered yesterday) adds agentic search capability to the AI cloud platform.

## SaaSpocalypse meta-narrative — Fortune's 3 factors, Thoma Bravo as buyer, $2T+ wipeout

The [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative deepened today with three major developments:

### Fortune's 3 factors separating winners from losers (Feb 12)

| Factor | Winners | Losers |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 1. Data moats | Companies managing sensitive/regulated data (payroll, security) | Commodity SaaS with replicate-able UI |
| 2. Pricing model | Usage-based pricing (grows with AI adoption) | Seat-based pricing (shrinks as AI replaces users) |
| 3. Cost discipline | Fair pricing relative to value | Aggressive price increases above inflation |

[[Rocket Software]] CEO Milan Shetti: "We have usage-based pricing, not seat-based pricing. The SaaS companies with user-based pricing have taken a hit, because if AI improves productivity, the number of users goes down."

[[Palantir]] CEO [[Alex Karp]]: AI should reduce IT costs — yet SaaS vendors keep raising prices above inflation.

[[Workday]] co-founder [[Aneel Bhusri]] returning as CEO to address the challenge. [[Salesforce]], [[Oracle]], [[Asana]], [[DocuSign]], [[Intuit]] all cited as under pressure.

### Thoma Bravo seeking bargains (Feb 11)

[[Thoma Bravo]] managing partner Holden Spaht on Bloomberg: "To think that all software is the same, they're missing the mark a bit. We think this could be a really exceptional buying opportunity."

Software P/S ratios compressed from 9x to 6x — levels not seen since mid-2010s. Thoma Bravo has been on an acquisition spree: Boeing Digital Aviation ($10.55B), Olo ($2B), [[Dayforce]] ($12.3B), [[Verint]] ($2B).

Troubling detail: January 2026 layoffs at acquired companies reportedly hit 40-50% of staff.

### Bloomberg "AI scare trade" widens (Feb 11)

The selloff has expanded from software to wealth management, real estate services, and financial data. S&P 500 software and services index -26% from late-October peak. >$1T in market cap destroyed. IPO window shuttered — Blackstone-backed [[Liftoff Mobile]] pulled.

JPMorgan: software stocks are being "sentenced before trial." Goldman Sachs CEO [[David Solomon]]: selloff was "too broad."

## Equinix (EQIX) Q4 — record bookings, 60% AI-driven, 2026 guide $10.1-10.2B

[[Equinix]] reported record Q4 bookings driven by AI workloads:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $2,420M | $9,217M (+5%) |
| Adj EBITDA | — | $4,530M (49% margin) |
| AFFO | — | $3,761M (+12%) |
| AFFO/share | — | $38.33 (+9%) |
| Gross bookings | $474M (record, +42%) | $1,600M (+27%) |
| Interconnections | 500,000+ | — |
| AI % of large deals | ~60% | Up from ~50% earlier in year |

2026 guidance:

| Metric | 2026 Guide |
|--------|------------|
| Revenue | $10.1-10.2B (+10-11%) |
| Adj EBITDA | $5.1-5.2B (~51% margin) |
| AFFO/share | $41.93-42.74 (+9-12%) |
| Capex | $3.7-4.2B |
| Dividend | +10% (11th consecutive year) |

52 expansion projects underway across 14 metros. Added ~1 GW of powered land-under-control. xScale JV planning $15B capital deployment.

Stock +8.6% — the AI data center buildout is the tide lifting Equinix. 60% of largest deals now AI-driven (up from ~50%) confirms accelerating demand mix shift.

## Paycom (PAYC) -8% — 2026 guide misses, SaaSpocalypse victim

[[Paycom]] beat Q4 EPS by $0.01 but 2026 revenue guidance disappointed:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| EPS | $2.45 (beat $2.44 est) | — |
| Revenue | $517.1M (+10.2% YoY) | — |

2026 guidance: $2.175-2.195B revenue (6-7% growth) — well below the growth rate investors expected. Stock down 41% over 12 months. Hit 52-week low of ~$118.

BMO cut PT to $137 (from $175), Barclays to $185 (from $210), Weiss downgraded to Sell.

Paycom is a textbook SaaSpocalypse victim — HCM/payroll is seat-based pricing, and AI agents promise to automate HR workflows. But payroll specifically may have more defensibility (Fortune's "data" factor — regulatory complexity, sensitive data).

## Rollins (ROL) -15% — Q4 misses on both lines

[[Rollins]] (pest control) missed Q4 estimates:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | vs Est |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $912.9M (+9.7% YoY) | Missed $927.7M |
| EPS | $0.25 | Missed $0.27 |
| Adj EBITDA | $193.7M | Missed $209M |

Management blamed weather. Operating cash flow -12.4% YoY. Stock -15% premarket. Not an AI story — this is pure operational miss in a defensive services company.

## Vertiv (VRT) +24% — Q4 beat, 2026 outlook crushes estimates (Feb 11)

[[Vertiv]] surged ~24% after blowout Q4 results and 2026 guidance that left analysts far behind:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $2.88B (in line) | $10.23B (+26% organic) |
| Adj EPS | $1.36 (beat $1.29) | $4.20 (+47%) |
| Orders | +252% organic YoY | — |
| Backlog | $15B | — |
| Book-to-bill | ~2.9x | — |
| Adj operating margin | 23.2% (+170bps) | 20.4% (+100bps) |
| Adj free cash flow | — | $1.89B (+66%) |

2026 guidance:

| Metric | 2026 Guide | vs Street |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Revenue | $13.25-13.75B | Street $12.39B (~$1.4B gap) |
| Adj EPS | $5.97-6.07 | — |
| Adj operating profit | $3.04B (+45%) | — |
| Adj operating margin | 22.5% (+210bps) | — |

Stock up 1,300% since end-2022 (~$70B market value created). The $15B backlog and 2.9x book-to-bill confirm AI data center power/cooling demand is accelerating, not plateauing. Vertiv is the picks-and-shovels play for the physical layer of AI infrastructure.

## Zillow (ZG) -17% — EPS missed by $0.41, cash flow deterioration (Feb 11)

[[Zillow]] dropped ~17% despite beating on revenue:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $654M (+18%) | Beat $650M est |
| EPS | $0.01 | Missed $0.42 est (by $0.41) |
| Adj EBITDA | $149M | Missed $151.5M est |
| FCF margin | 6.7% | Down from 15.9% |

Segment: Residential +8% ($418M), mortgage +39% ($57M), rentals +45% ($168M). Q1 guide: $700-710M (above $690M est). Cash flow deterioration the key concern — FCF margin halved. Legal expenses reducing adj EBITDA margin by 2pp in Q1. Stock hit 52-week low $51.85, down 30.9% YTD. Goldman cut PT to $62, Cantor to $56. Also in the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] crosshairs — real estate services the latest sector facing AI scare trade selling.

## Richard Attias & Associates — banks selected for ~$1B IPO

[[Richard Attias & Associates]] (RA&A), the organizer of the [[Future Investment Initiative]] summit ("Davos in the Desert"), has selected banks including [[Evercore]] for an IPO that could value the events firm at ~$1B. [[Sanabil]] (a [[Saudi PIF]] subsidiary) owns ~75%; founder Richard Attias holds the rest. The deal could come as early as 2026.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Company | Richard Attias & Associates |
| Valuation | ~$1B |
| Majority owner | [[Sanabil]] (~75%, [[Saudi PIF]] sub) |
| Adviser | [[Evercore]] + others |
| Key event | [[Future Investment Initiative]] |
| Offices | 6 (NYC, Paris, Riyadh, Dubai, Dakar, Beijing) |
| Employees | 120+ |

RA&A has organized FII since 2017. The IPO is partly a [[Tadawul]] capital markets development play — more Saudi listings, more foreign investor access. The question is whether a single-event franchise (however prestigious) justifies $1B.

## Zhipu (2513.HK) +30% — GLM-5 launch + JPMorgan Overweight initiation

[[Zhipu]] surged ~30% to HK$405 ($51.80), hitting a record high and pushing market cap to ~$19B — nearly 3x the $6.6B IPO valuation from five weeks ago. Two catalysts converged:

### JPMorgan initiation (Feb 10)

[[JPMorgan]] analyst Olivia Xu initiated coverage at Overweight with HK$400 price target. Also initiated [[MiniMax]] at Overweight (HK$700 PT). [[Goldman Sachs]] initiated around the same time.

| Metric | JPMorgan view |
|--------|---------------|
| Rating | Overweight |
| Target | HK$400 |
| Sales CAGR | 127% through 2030 |
| Profitability | 2029 |
| Thesis | Potential leader in next phase of global AI value creation |

JPMorgan argues China's AI market is consolidating from 200+ model developers to <10 — Zhipu and MiniMax positioned to survive as independent foundation model labs.

### GLM-5 release (Feb 11-12)

| Metric | GLM-5 | GLM-4.7 |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Parameters | 744B | 355B |
| Training data | 28.5T tokens | — |
| Architecture | DeepSeek Sparse Attention | — |

Claims to approach [[Claude]] Opus 4.5 on coding benchmarks and surpass [[Google]] Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. Topped open-source leaderboard on Artificial Analysis. Framed as shift from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering."

### Pricing power signal

Zhipu hiked GLM Coding Plan prices by 30%+ citing rapid user growth. Base plan still ~20 yuan/month (~$3) — 1/7 the price of Claude Pro.

### Financials context (from IPO prospectus)

| Period | Revenue (RMB) | Net loss (RMB) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 2022 | 57.4M | (143.7M) |
| 2023 | 124.5M | (788.0M) |
| 2024 | 312.4M | (2,958.0M) |
| H1 2025 | 190.9M | (2,357.9M) |

R&D burn at 7-8x revenue. Cloud gross margin collapsed from 76.1% (2022) to -0.4% (H1 2025) under [[DeepSeek]] pricing pressure. On-prem/privatized cloud is 84.5% of revenue — the stickier, higher-margin business. Trading at ~150x 2024 P/S, ~39x 2025E.

Stock up ~249% from IPO in 5 weeks. The question is whether this is [[MiniMax]]/[[Biren Tech]]-style momentum or a durable re-rating backed by the consolidation thesis.

## Nuveen acquires Schroders for $13.5B — largest-ever European fund manager deal

[[Nuveen]] ([[TIAA]]'s asset management arm) announced a £9.9B ($13.5B) all-cash acquisition of [[Schroders]], ending 222 years of family independence. Creates a $2.5T AUM global giant.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | 612p/share (590p + 22p dividends) |
| Premium | 34% to prior close |
| Valuation | 16.5x 2026 earnings |
| Combined AUM | ~$2.5T |
| Combined private markets | $414B |
| SDR stock | +29% |

**Deal risk spread:** ~4% (trading ~588p vs 612p offer). Only 41% irrevocable commitments. Morningstar's Johann Scholtz: "This story is unlikely to end at the current terms." Possible price bump or competing bid.

Schroder family selling entire 44% stake. Schroders brand maintained, London HQ stays, CEO Oldfield continues. Nuveen was 94% Americas — gets EMEA footprint. Schroders 2025 operating profit +25% YoY to £756.6M.

Sector implications: [[Aberdeen]] seen as next target. Mid-sized European active managers under pressure from passive giants + UK stock discount.

## Apple Siri upgrade hits testing snags — staggered delay (Gurman)

[[Apple]]'s [[Siri]] overhaul has run into testing problems in recent weeks, pushing back the rollout of key AI features ([[Mark Gurman]], Bloomberg):

| Original plan | New timeline | Features |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| iOS 26.4 (March) | **iOS 26.5 (May/June)** | Many Siri capabilities (staggered) |
| iOS 26.4 (March) | **iOS 27 (September)** | Personal context features (apps, calendar, files) |

Full chatbot revamp now expected with iOS 27 alongside fall iPhone launch — potentially **~2 years** after initial WWDC 2024 announcement.

Gurman: the [[Apple-Google AI deal|Google Gemini collaboration]] is the only reason Apple will still ship this year. Apple's own models being improved by [[Gemini]] team. But the competitive question: where will [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], and [[Google]] be by September?

iPhone sales unaffected — $85B quarter. The risk isn't hardware, it's the AI credibility gap widening while competitors ship.

## Agibank (AGBK) IPOs on NYSE — downsized from $785M to $240M, opens below offer

[[Agibank]] (AGI Inc., NYSE: AGBK) debuted on the NYSE after a dramatically downsized IPO:

| Detail | Original plan | Actual |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Shares offered | 43.6M | 20M |
| Price range | $15-18 | $12 (low of revised $12-13) |
| Gross proceeds | ~$785M | $240M ($276M w/ greenshoe) |
| Implied market cap | ~$3.0-3.3B | ~$1.9B |
| Opening price | — | $11.00 (-8.3% from IPO) |
| Day 1 close | — | ~$10.75 (-10.4%) |

**Why slashed:** [[PicPay]]'s ~20% post-IPO decline (PICS, NASDAQ, Jan 29) poisoned sentiment. Two INSS suspensions in 2025 (post-death contracts, data manipulation) added governance risk. Original $3B+ target was nearly 2x the last private round (R$9.3B).

**Underwriters:** [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]] (active), [[Citigroup]] (passive).

Agibank is a hybrid neobank — 6.4M customers, 1,101 "Smart Hubs" in 723 cities, only neobank with INSS accreditation. R$871M net income in FY 2024 (+103% YoY), 43.9% ROAE. The financials are strong; the market reception was not.

This is the second Brazilian fintech IPO in two weeks after PicPay. Both have traded below offer price. UBS BB poll expects 10+ Brazilian IPOs in 2026 — early signals suggest the window is open but the pricing power is with buyers, not sellers.

## Simile raises $100M — Stanford generative agents spinout for behavior prediction

[[Simile]] emerged from stealth with a $100M raise led by [[Index Ventures]], with [[Bain Capital]] Ventures, A*, Hanabi Capital, and angels [[Fei-Fei Li]] and [[Andrej Karpathy]]. The company commercializes [[Stanford]] research on generative agent simulations of real humans.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round | $100M (Series A) |
| Lead | [[Index Ventures]] |
| Angels | [[Fei-Fei Li]], [[Andrej Karpathy]] |
| CEO | Joon Sung Park (Stanford PhD) |
| Co-founders | [[Michael Bernstein]], [[Percy Liang]] (both Stanford CS faculty) |
| Key customers | [[CVS Health|CVS]], [[Gallup]], [[Wealthfront]], [[Suntory]] |

Core product: AI agents ("similes") built from two-hour qualitative interviews with real people, used for simulated focus groups, digital polling panels, and concept testing. CVS has created hundreds of thousands of similes representing real customers. Gallup building nationally representative AI polling panels. Claimed 8/10 earnings call question prediction accuracy.

Research lineage: Joon Sung Park's "Generative Agents" paper (UIST 2023 Best Paper) and "Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People" (2024) — agents replicated real humans' survey responses 85% as accurately as the humans replicated their own answers two weeks later.

## Altruist AI tax tool triggers wealth management selloff — CEO on Bloomberg

[[Altruist]] CEO Jason Wenk appeared on Bloomberg Tech after the company's [[Hazel]] AI tax planning launch (Feb 10) wiped tens of billions in wealth management market cap:

| Stock | Move (Feb 10-11) |
|-------|-----------------|
| [[LPL Financial]] | -8.3% |
| [[Charles Schwab]] | -7.4% |
| [[Raymond James]] | -8.8% |

Key quotes from CEO interview:
- "No one could have thought that somewhere between tens of billions to maybe $100 billion of market cap would be wiped out in a week"
- Altruist is **not** looking to replace wealth managers — AI is "an incredible equalizer" that turns 10-person, hundreds-of-hours work into minutes
- Tax planning is "just the start" — more agents coming to make advice better and more accessible
- Hundreds of large wealth management firms have reached out in the last 48 hours to explore partnerships
- Hazel is available to any independent advisor regardless of custodian — deliberately separated from Altruist's custodian business

The "platform vs feature" distinction matters: Wenk emphasized being "the platform, not just a feature." If you're a feature, you can be embedded into a bigger platform. This echoes the SaaSpocalypse framework — wealth management could see the same repricing that hit SaaS.

Analyst view (Bloomberg Intelligence): selloff appears tied to broader concerns about AI disrupting the financial advice model, centering on fee compression and market-share shifts long-term.

## SoftBank Q3 FY2025 — 4th consecutive quarterly profit, OpenAI stake drives gains

[[SoftBank]] posted its fourth consecutive quarterly profit, fueled by the rising valuation of its [[OpenAI]] stake:

| Metric | Q3 FY2025 (Oct-Dec) | 9M FY2025 |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Net profit | ¥248.6B ($1.62B) | ¥3.17T ($20.7B) |
| YoY | vs ¥369B loss | 5x year-ago |
| OpenAI investment gain | — | $19.8B (cumulative) |
| OpenAI stake | 11% | ~$34.6B invested |

Capital moves:
- Exited [[NVIDIA]] position entirely
- Sold T-Mobile stake: $12.7B (Jun-Dec)
- Expanded [[Arm Holdings|Arm]] margin loan: $13.5B → $20B
- In talks to invest additional $30B in OpenAI at $750-830B valuation

BTIG analyst Jesse Sobelson: SoftBank is "the only real way to directly play OpenAI in today's public markets" — OpenAI represents ~30% of NAV.

SoftBank CFO Yoshimitsu Goto: "Our investments are beginning to pay off."

US-listed ADR (SFTBY) +3%.

## Waymo targets 1M weekly rides — London testing 30+ boroughs, federal AV framework push

[[Waymo]] co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana outlined expansion strategy on Bloomberg:

| Metric | Current | 2026 Target |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Weekly paid rides | 450K+ | 1M (year-end) |
| US cities | 4 active | 20+ |
| London boroughs testing | 30+ of 60 | Commercial launch |
| Tokyo | — | Launch with [[Nihon Kotsu]] / Go |

Expansion pipeline: Nashville (driverless testing started this week), Washington, Detroit, Las Vegas, San Diego, Denver — all expected to launch with [[Lyft]] in 2026.

London: testing in 30+ of 60 boroughs (~60% of city). Partnership with [[Moove]] for fleet operations. UK regulators described as "forward-leaning." If Labour government passes AV rules, commercial driverless service could launch this year — faster than any US city deployment.

Federal framework: Mawakana advocated for federal AV standards with transparency and safety-based requirements. NYC remains blocked — no rules allowing removal of human operator. New York State permits exist for supervised testing.

On Tesla: defended multi-sensor approach but did not rule out future sensor stack trimming for cost.

| On-demand GMV | $6.1B (record) | — |

Medium-term (2025-2028): 20% revenue CAGR, $1.5B Adj EBITDA in 2028, 80% adj FCF conversion.

- **$500M share buyback** authorized
- **[[Stash Financial]] acquisition** — $425M for 50.1% of US-based AI investing platform (remainder over 3 years)
- **Lending:** Net loan portfolio $1.18B (+120% YoY), doubling target in 2026
- **Grocery:** 1.7x faster growth than food delivery

## Algorhythm Holdings (RIME) SemiCab paper crashes logistics stocks

[[Algorhythm Holdings]] (NASDAQ: RIME), a micro-cap AI company, triggered the latest wave of the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|AI disruption trade]] with two announcements about its SemiCab freight platform:

| Announcement | Claim |
|-------------|-------|
| Feb 9 white paper | 70%+ reduction in empty freight miles across live networks |
| Feb 12 press release | 400% more freight volume per operator (2,000 loads/yr vs 500 industry benchmark) |

Market damage:

| Stock | Move |
|-------|------|
| [[C.H. Robinson]] | -14.5% (intraday -24% record) |
| [[RXO]] | -20.5% |
| [[Expeditors International]] | -13.2% |
| [[J.B. Hunt]] | -5% |
| [[XPO Logistics|XPO]] | -6% |
| [[Landstar System]] | -18% |
| [[DSV]] (Europe) | Double-digit decline |
| [[Kuehne and Nagel]] (Europe) | Double-digit decline |
| Russell 3000 Trucking Index | -7.8% |
| Dow Transports | Worst day since Apr 2025 |
| Algorhythm (RIME) | +31% |

SemiCab targets the $3T global truckload market where trucks drive empty ~33% of miles — $1T in annual waste. Live deployments in India achieved >90% loaded-mile utilization. Now expanding to US via Apex SaaS platform. ARR $9.7M (+300% YoY).

Analyst reaction: Barclays' Brandon Oglenski called the selloff "disproportionate to the risk" and would buy the sector on weakness. Benchmark's Christopher Kuhn: unlikely big corporations abandon major brokers for this software.

This is the SaaSpocalypse playbook expanding to logistics — a penny stock's press release wiping billions in market cap from established freight brokers. Same pattern as [[Altruist]] → wealth management, [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork]] → software.

## Meta/Instagram addiction trial — Mosseri testifies, Zuckerberg next

[[Meta]]'s Instagram head [[Adam Mosseri]] testified in a landmark social media addiction trial in Los Angeles (Feb 11):

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Case | K.G.M. v. Meta/Google (bellwether) |
| Plaintiff | 20-year-old California woman |
| Defendants | [[Meta]], [[Google]] (YouTube) |
| Settled | [[TikTok]], [[Snap]] |
| Trial length | 8 weeks |
| Cases pending | 1,500+ similar lawsuits |

Key testimony:
- Mosseri distinguished "problematic use" from "clinical addiction" — confronted with his own 2020 podcast saying social media can be "addictive" (claimed he misspoke)
- Denied Instagram targets teens for profit: "We make less money from teens than any other demographic"
- Plaintiffs countered: early users stay longer → lifetime value
- Instagram's 2019 internal debate on beauty filters: experts "unanimous on the harm" — filters altering facial features were un-banned but stopped being recommended
- Mosseri compensation: ~$900K salary + stock worth "tens of millions"

What's next: [[Mark Zuckerberg]] scheduled to testify next week. [[YouTube]] CEO also expected. Separate Meta trial in New Mexico started this week.

Outcome matters: this bellwether case will shape how 1,500+ pending cases are decided — potential for material liability if jury finds platforms knowingly designed for addiction.

## Cisco — Bloomberg analyst: memory cost issue driving ~200bp margin erosion

[[Cisco]] shares extended losses to -11% during the session. Bloomberg Technology's senior analyst provided additional color:

- Memory chip cost inflation is squeezing gross margins despite strong AI order momentum ($2.1B from hyperscalers)
- ~200bp margin erosion calculated from the memory cost impact
- Q4 showed margin stabilization — management believes it can navigate through pricing power
- Software business (larger share of revenue) provides margin buffer
- Cisco described as "a very important company driving a lot of AI adoption" despite margin headwinds

The analyst framed memory as having both secular (underinvestment cycle) and cyclical elements. Cisco's networking position in AI is growing but profitability is being traded for market share in the transition.

## Rivian (RIVN) Q4 2025 — EPS beat, software/VW JV transforms financials, +15% AH

[[Rivian]] beat Q4 estimates and issued strong 2026 delivery guidance, sending shares up 15% after hours:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Estimate | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Adj EPS | -$0.54 | -$0.68 | — |
| Revenue | $1.29B | $1.28B | $5.39B (+8%) |

| Net loss | -$804M | — | -$3.67B (-26% YoY) |
| Deliveries | 9,745 | — | 42,247 (-18% YoY) |

The transformation story: software & services revenue hit $1.56B (+222% YoY) driven by the [[Volkswagen]] JV, generating $576M gross profit vs $7M in 2024. Automotive segment still losing money (-$432M gross loss) but dramatically improved from -$1.2B+ in 2024.

2026 guidance: 62,000-67,000 deliveries (+47-59%), adj pre-tax loss -$1.8 to -$2.1B, capex $1.95-2.05B. R2 first customer deliveries on track for Q2 2026; full unveil March 12 at SXSW. [[RJ Scaringe]]: R2 will be "majority of volume" by end of 2027.

Analyst moves: [[Piper Sandler]] raised PT from $14 to $20. [[UBS]] had previously downgraded to Sell. Greg Revelle joined as Chief Customer Officer (ex-Kohl's, Best Buy, AutoNation).

After-hours: $14 close → ~$16.10 (+15%).
