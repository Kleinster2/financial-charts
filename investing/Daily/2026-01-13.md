## Research notes

### Philosophy separation pattern

Established architectural pattern: **separate philosophy from person and company**.

| Philosophy (concept) | Person (actor) | Company (actor) |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| [[YC startup philosophy]] | [[Paul Graham]] | [[Y Combinator]] |
| [[Dalio Principles]] | [[Ray Dalio]] | [[Bridgewater]] |

**Why this works:**
- Philosophies outlive people and companies
- Avoids duplication between person/company notes
- Makes ideas linkable from anywhere (e.g., competitors can link to philosophy)
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### Y Combinator portfolio expansion

Created comprehensive notes for 6 major YC portfolio companies:

**Public companies:**
- [[Dropbox]] (DBX) — Revenue declining but 41% non-GAAP margin
- [[Reddit]] (RDDT) — 68% YoY revenue growth, profitable
- [[GitLab]] (GTLB) — 88% gross margin, FCF positive

**Private/acquired:**
- [[Brex]] — IPO candidate, ~$500-700M ARR
- [[Faire]] — Down from $12.6B to $5.2B valuation
- [[Twitch]] — Amazon subsidiary, $1.8B revenue
