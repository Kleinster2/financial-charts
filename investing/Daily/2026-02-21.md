## Saba/Cox tender offers for Blue Owl BDCs

[[Saba Capital]] and [[Cox Capital Partners]] announced intention to launch cash tender offers for shares of three [[Blue Owl]] non-traded BDCs — OBDC II, OTIC, and OCIC — at **20-35% discount to NAV**. Notice sent Feb 17 (OBDC II), with OTIC and OCIC following. Extends Saba's closed-end fund activism into non-traded BDCs for the first time. OWL +2.2% after-hours. See [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]].

## Notes created/expanded

- [[Cox Capital Partners]] — created stub. Philadelphia-based secondary liquidity firm (est. 2020). Co-purchaser with Saba on Blue Owl BDC tender offers. Prior deals: FBCC (31% discount), FSSL (42% discount).
- [[Saba Capital]] — added Blue Owl BDC tender offers section and timeline entry. Extends closed-end fund activism playbook to non-traded BDCs for the first time.
- [[Cybersecurity]] — added "AI: the dual disruption" section. Covers AI as threat amplifier (Amazon/600 firewalls, AWS 8-min breach) and vendor disruptor (Claude Code Security, Aardvark). Updated risks, growth drivers, related links.

## AI as attack force multiplier — Amazon research

[[Amazon]] security research disclosed that Russian-speaking hackers (possibly one person) used commercial GenAI tools to breach 600+ firewalls across 55 countries in weeks. Separately, Sysdig documented an [[AWS]] environment breached in ~8 minutes using LLM-generated code (Nov 2025, disclosed Feb 2026). Both stories highlight AI collapsing the skill threshold and time-to-breach. Updated [[Cybersecurity]] sector hub with new "AI: the dual disruption" section covering both the threat-amplifier (bullish for spend) and vendor-disruptor (bearish for incumbents) dynamics.

## WBD-Paramount-Netflix deal tracker update

Two days before the **Feb 23 deadline** for Paramount's "best and final" offer:

1. **Paramount clears HSR antitrust hurdle (Feb 20)** — DOJ waiting period expired after second request response. But Netflix CLO pushed back hard: "routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval." Paramount filed preemptively without a signed deal. Paramount CLO is Makan Delrahim (ex-Trump DOJ antitrust chief).

2. **WBD employee sentiment shifts to Netflix (Variety, Feb 20)** — Rank-and-file now largely favor Netflix over Paramount takeover. Sarandos/Peters won them over. Skepticism remains on theatrical distribution despite 45-day window promise.

3. **Monday Feb 23 is D-day** — Paramount must submit best-and-final. Key question: will they top $31/share (the verbal number that opened the door)? If not, Netflix deal likely proceeds to March 20 shareholder vote.

Updated [[Warner Bros Discovery]] with full details.

## OpenAI compute spend reset

[[OpenAI]] told investors it's targeting **~$600B in compute spend by 2030**, down from the $1.4T infrastructure figure touted in late 2025. The $1.4T included partner commitments ([[SoftBank]], [[Oracle]] for [[Stargate]]); the $600B is OpenAI's own compute spend. Also disclosed: **$280B revenue target for 2030** (roughly equal consumer/enterprise split), 2025 actuals of $13.1B revenue and $8B burn (both beating targets), [[ChatGPT]] at 900M+ WAU, [[Codex]] at 1.5M+ WAU. Updated [[OpenAI]].

## CNBC: Alphabet +4%, TPU competitive positioning

[[Google]] rallied 4% on convergence of tariff relief, AI ad improvements ("Photoshoot"), and strengthening TPU competitive position. [[Broadcom]] disclosed [[Anthropic]] bought **$21B in TPUs** — first concrete pricing data, undercutting [[NVIDIA]]. WSJ reported Google looking to invest **$100M into [[FluidStack]]** for neo-cloud TPU distribution. Meanwhile, [[Blue Owl]] lenders balked at financing a **$4B [[CoreWeave]] data center**, creating headwinds for NVIDIA's GPU complex. Analysts see Google at "pole position" in Mag 7 for AI commercialization.

Updated [[Google]], [[Blue Owl]], [[CoreWeave]], [[FluidStack]].
