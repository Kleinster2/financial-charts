## AI as attack force multiplier — Amazon research

[[Amazon]] security research disclosed that Russian-speaking hackers (possibly one person) used commercial GenAI tools to breach 600+ firewalls across 55 countries in weeks. Separately, Sysdig documented an [[AWS]] environment breached in ~8 minutes using LLM-generated code (Nov 2025, disclosed Feb 2026). Both stories highlight AI collapsing the skill threshold and time-to-breach. Updated [[Cybersecurity]] sector hub with new "AI: the dual disruption" section covering both the threat-amplifier (bullish for spend) and vendor-disruptor (bearish for incumbents) dynamics.

## WBD-Paramount-Netflix deal tracker update

Two days before the **Feb 23 deadline** for Paramount's "best and final" offer:

1. **Paramount clears HSR antitrust hurdle (Feb 20)** — DOJ waiting period expired after second request response. But Netflix CLO pushed back hard: "routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval." Paramount filed preemptively without a signed deal. Paramount CLO is Makan Delrahim (ex-Trump DOJ antitrust chief).

2. **WBD employee sentiment shifts to Netflix (Variety, Feb 20)** — Rank-and-file now largely favor Netflix over Paramount takeover. Sarandos/Peters won them over. Skepticism remains on theatrical distribution despite 45-day window promise.

3. **Monday Feb 23 is D-day** — Paramount must submit best-and-final. Key question: will they top $31/share (the verbal number that opened the door)? If not, Netflix deal likely proceeds to March 20 shareholder vote.

Updated [[Warner Bros Discovery]] with full details.

## OpenAI compute spend reset

[[OpenAI]] told investors it's targeting **~$600B in compute spend by 2030**, down from the $1.4T infrastructure figure touted in late 2025. The $1.4T included partner commitments ([[SoftBank]], [[Oracle]] for [[Stargate]]); the $600B is OpenAI's own compute spend. Also disclosed: **$280B revenue target for 2030** (roughly equal consumer/enterprise split), 2025 actuals of $13.1B revenue and $8B burn (both beating targets), [[ChatGPT]] at 900M+ WAU, [[Codex]] at 1.5M+ WAU. Updated [[OpenAI]].
