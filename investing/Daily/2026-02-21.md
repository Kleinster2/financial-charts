## AI as attack force multiplier — Amazon research

[[Amazon]] security research disclosed that Russian-speaking hackers (possibly one person) used commercial GenAI tools to breach 600+ firewalls across 55 countries in weeks. Separately, Sysdig documented an [[AWS]] environment breached in ~8 minutes using LLM-generated code (Nov 2025, disclosed Feb 2026). Both stories highlight AI collapsing the skill threshold and time-to-breach. Updated [[Cybersecurity]] sector hub with new "AI: the dual disruption" section covering both the threat-amplifier (bullish for spend) and vendor-disruptor (bearish for incumbents) dynamics.

## WBD-Paramount-Netflix deal tracker update

Two days before the **Feb 23 deadline** for Paramount's "best and final" offer:

1. **Paramount clears HSR antitrust hurdle (Feb 20)** — DOJ waiting period expired after second request response. But Netflix CLO pushed back hard: "routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval." Paramount filed preemptively without a signed deal. Paramount CLO is Makan Delrahim (ex-Trump DOJ antitrust chief).

2. **WBD employee sentiment shifts to Netflix (Variety, Feb 20)** — Rank-and-file now largely favor Netflix over Paramount takeover. Sarandos/Peters won them over. Skepticism remains on theatrical distribution despite 45-day window promise.

3. **Monday Feb 23 is D-day** — Paramount must submit best-and-final. Key question: will they top $31/share (the verbal number that opened the door)? If not, Netflix deal likely proceeds to March 20 shareholder vote.

Updated [[Warner Bros Discovery]] with full details.

## OpenAI compute spend reset

[[OpenAI]] told investors it's targeting **~$600B in compute spend by 2030**, down from the $1.4T infrastructure figure touted in late 2025. The $1.4T included partner commitments ([[SoftBank]], [[Oracle]] for [[Stargate]]); the $600B is OpenAI's own compute spend. Also disclosed: **$280B revenue target for 2030** (roughly equal consumer/enterprise split), 2025 actuals of $13.1B revenue and $8B burn (both beating targets), [[ChatGPT]] at 900M+ WAU, [[Codex]] at 1.5M+ WAU. Updated [[OpenAI]].

## CNBC: Alphabet +4%, TPU competitive positioning

[[Google]] rallied 4% on convergence of tariff relief, AI ad improvements ("Photoshoot"), and strengthening TPU competitive position. [[Broadcom]] disclosed [[Anthropic]] bought **$21B in TPUs** — first concrete pricing data, undercutting [[NVIDIA]]. WSJ reported Google looking to invest **$100M into [[FluidStack]]** for neo-cloud TPU distribution. Meanwhile, [[Blue Owl]] lenders balked at financing a **$4B [[CoreWeave]] data center**, creating headwinds for NVIDIA's GPU complex. Analysts see Google at "pole position" in Mag 7 for AI commercialization.

Updated [[Google]], [[Blue Owl]], [[CoreWeave]], [[FluidStack]].

## Canada certifies Gulfstream G500/G600 after Trump threat

Transport Canada certified [[General Dynamics]]' Gulfstream **G500 and G600** business jets (Feb 15), after [[Donald Trump]] threatened on Jan 30 to decertify all Canadian-built aircraft ([[Bombardier]]) and impose 50% tariffs. The **G700 and G800** remain pending — fuel-system icing concern that the FAA/EASA handled via temporary exemption but Canada held stricter. Core allegation: [[Canada]] was slow-walking Gulfstream certification to protect [[Bombardier]], whose Global Express competes directly. BBD.B dropped ~6% on the initial threat, then recovered. Discussions between Transport Canada and FAA continue on remaining models.

Updated [[General Dynamics]], [[Canada]]. Created [[Bombardier]] (stub), [[Canada Gulfstream certification]] (event).

## US revokes visas for three Chilean officials over China cable

US State Department revoked visas for [[Chile]]'s Transport Minister **Juan Carlos Muñoz**, Undersecretary of Telecommunications **Claudio Araya**, and [[Subtel]] cabinet head **Guillermo Petersen** (Feb 20). Cited activities that "compromised critical telecommunications infrastructure and undermined regional security." The trigger: Chile's advancement of the [[Chile-China Express]] cable — a proposed submarine fiber link from Valparaiso to Hong Kong, operated by [[China Mobile]]. First time the US has sanctioned a sitting allied cabinet minister over telecom infrastructure. The US prefers the [[Humboldt Cable]] (Google/NEC, Chile → Australia via French Polynesia), already under installation. Chile is caught — [[China]] is its #1 trade partner (copper), the US its primary security ally.

Updated [[Chile]], [[Humboldt Cable]], [[Submarine Cables]]. Created [[US Chile cable visa sanctions]] (event), [[Chile-China Express]] (actor), [[China Mobile]] (stub), [[Subtel]] (stub).

## Abu Dhabi as crypto capital

Abu Dhabi making the most aggressive sovereign-level crypto bet globally. [[MGX]] put $2B into [[Binance]] (March 2025, largest institutional crypto investment ever). [[Mubadala]] accumulated $1.38B in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), buying through the late 2025 / early 2026 dip. ADGM framework bans privacy coins and algorithmic stablecoins — targeting institutional adoption, not retail. Competes with Dubai (VARA, more permissive), Singapore, Hong Kong, and a newly pro-crypto US.

Created [[Abu Dhabi Crypto Hub]] (Concepts). Updated [[Mubadala]] with IBIT position.

## Diamond market collapse

Created [[Diamond market collapse]] concept note from BofA chart. Diamond price index at ~3,400 — below 2002 levels, down 40%+ from 2022.

## Chinese AI labs dominating OpenRouter + Neil Shen / HongShan

WSJ: [[Neil Shen]] (formerly Sequoia China) channeling **American institutional capital** ($9B from US pension funds/endowments) into Chinese AI labs via [[HongShan]] ($56B AUM). Those labs now dominate OpenRouter by token volume — the top 3 are all Chinese:

2. [[Moonshot AI]] Kimi K2.5 — 1.16T tokens
3. [[Zhipu AI]] GLM 5 — 1.03T tokens (+462%)
