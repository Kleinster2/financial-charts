## WBD/Paramount/Netflix — Paramount bids $31, board reopens door

Paramount submitted its "best and final" offer at **$31/share all-cash** for all of WBD (Feb 24). Below the $32 insiders expected but still a ~12% premium over Netflix's $27.75/share (studios+HBO only).

**WBD board is now weighing whether to designate Paramount's bid as a "Superior Proposal."** If so, Netflix gets 4 business days to match. Reuters reports WBD has "reopened the door" to Paramount — strongest signal yet the board may flip.

Key players:
- **Ancora Holdings** — activist pushing for Paramount engagement; plans proxy fight
- **Pentwater Capital** — large shareholder backing Paramount; CEO Halbower eyed for WBD board
- **Sarandos** — signaled Netflix won't overpay ("willing to walk away")
- **Theater owners** — lobbying against Netflix deal (theatrical distribution concerns)

**Timeline:** Board decision on Superior Proposal → Netflix 4-day match window → March 20 shareholder vote.
