## WBD/Paramount/Netflix — Paramount bids $31, board reopens door

Paramount submitted its "best and final" offer at **$31/share all-cash** for all of WBD (Feb 24). Below the $32 insiders expected but still a ~12% premium over Netflix's $27.75/share (studios+HBO only).

**WBD board is now weighing whether to designate Paramount's bid as a "Superior Proposal."** If so, Netflix gets 4 business days to match. Reuters reports WBD has "reopened the door" to Paramount — strongest signal yet the board may flip.

Key players:
- **Ancora Holdings** — activist pushing for Paramount engagement; plans proxy fight
- **Pentwater Capital** — large shareholder backing Paramount; CEO Halbower eyed for WBD board
- **Sarandos** — signaled Netflix won't overpay ("willing to walk away")
- **Theater owners** — lobbying against Netflix deal (theatrical distribution concerns)

**Timeline:** Board decision on Superior Proposal → Netflix 4-day match window → March 20 shareholder vote.

- [[Teleperformance]] — full actor note. World's largest BPO, €10.3B revenue, 500K+ employees. Stock down ~85% from €402 ATH (Jan 2022) to ~€60. The poster child for AI disruption: Klarna chatbot moment (Feb 2024, -14% in a day), short interest now 6.4% vs 2.4% EU tech avg. Revenue growth collapsed from 14% CAGR to 1.1% consensus. Full AI bear/bull case analysis. Earnings Feb 27 — catalyst. Links to [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]], [[Klarna]], [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis]].
- [[Concentrix]] — stub. World's #2 BPO (~$9B rev), same AI exposure as TEP.
- [[IBM]] — major update. Added Feb 23 Anthropic COBOL shock section: -13.2% (worst day since 2000), ~$40B wiped, -26% for Feb (worst month since 1968). Why COBOL is IBM's deepest moat (95% of ATM transactions, shrinking developer pool). Anthropic's Claude Code claim. IBM's response (Rob Thomas: translation ≠ modernization). The real threat: AI removes the last barrier to *considering* mainframe migration. Same pattern as [[Teleperformance]] — threat destroys equity before actual replacement. Updated bear case and related links.
- Updated [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] — added customer service outsourcing row + Week 4 "Anthropic reversal" section. Anthropic enterprise agents event (Feb 24) reversed the SaaSpocalypse narrative: partnerships with [[Intuit]], [[Salesforce]], [[DocuSign]], [[LegalZoom]], [[FactSet]], Gmail. Thomson Reuters +11%, FactSet +6%, Salesforce +4%. Wedbush: AI competition risk "overblown." Updated [[Intuit]] (Anthropic multi-year deal, MCP integrations, Claude Agent SDK, strategic analysis) and [[Anthropic]] (added Intuit partnership + cascade reversal links).
- [[Taalas]] — full actor note. Toronto startup that hardwires AI model weights directly into silicon transistors — the model IS the computer. Founded by Ljubisa Bajic (ex-Tenstorrent founder, ex-AMD/NVIDIA). HC1 chip: TSMC 6nm, 815mm², Llama 3.1 8B baked in. Claims 10x TPS + 20x lower cost vs GPU inference. No HBM, no CUDA, no software stack. 2-month model→chip turnaround via TSMC. $219M raised (Quiet Capital, Fidelity, Pierre Lamond), only $30M spent, $170M+ in bank. 25 employees. DeepSeek R1 demo: 12K TPS/user in 30-chip cluster. Sidesteps [[CUDA moat]] entirely. Tradeoff: model-locked chips. Created [[Jim Keller]] stub.
