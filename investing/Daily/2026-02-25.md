## WBD/Paramount/Netflix — Paramount bids $31, board reopens door

Paramount submitted its "best and final" offer at **$31/share all-cash** for all of WBD (Feb 24). Below the $32 insiders expected but still a ~12% premium over Netflix's $27.75/share (studios+HBO only).

**WBD board is now weighing whether to designate Paramount's bid as a "Superior Proposal."** If so, Netflix gets 4 business days to match. Reuters reports WBD has "reopened the door" to Paramount — strongest signal yet the board may flip.

Key players:
- **Ancora Holdings** — activist pushing for Paramount engagement; plans proxy fight
- **Pentwater Capital** — large shareholder backing Paramount; CEO Halbower eyed for WBD board
- **Sarandos** — signaled Netflix won't overpay ("willing to walk away")
- **Theater owners** — lobbying against Netflix deal (theatrical distribution concerns)

**Timeline:** Board decision on Superior Proposal → Netflix 4-day match window → March 20 shareholder vote.

- [[Teleperformance]] — full actor note. World's largest BPO, €10.3B revenue, 500K+ employees. Stock down ~85% from €402 ATH (Jan 2022) to ~€60. The poster child for AI disruption: Klarna chatbot moment (Feb 2024, -14% in a day), short interest now 6.4% vs 2.4% EU tech avg. Revenue growth collapsed from 14% CAGR to 1.1% consensus. Full AI bear/bull case analysis. Earnings Feb 27 — catalyst. Links to [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]], [[Klarna]], [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis]].
- [[Concentrix]] — stub. World's #2 BPO (~$9B rev), same AI exposure as TEP.
- [[Citadel Securities 2026 Global Intelligence Crisis]] — new event note. Citadel Securities' institutional counterpoint to Citrini, published Feb 24 (one day after market crash). Frank Flight, Global Macro Strategy. Five-point framework: recursive tech ≠ recursive adoption, Fed data shows flat AI adoption at work, SW eng jobs +11% YoY, compute costs create natural ceiling, productivity shocks historically positive. Keynes 15-hour workweek parallel. Established the two poles of the 2026 AI macro debate: Citrini (exponential displacement) vs Citadel (S-curve bounded by economics). Includes weaknesses in Citadel's argument. Updated [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis]] (added institutional response section) and [[Citadel Securities]] (added paper section).
- [[IBM]] — major update. Added Feb 23 Anthropic COBOL shock section: -13.2% (worst day since 2000), ~$40B wiped, -26% for Feb (worst month since 1968). Why COBOL is IBM's deepest moat (95% of ATM transactions, shrinking developer pool). Anthropic's Claude Code claim. IBM's response (Rob Thomas: translation ≠ modernization). The real threat: AI removes the last barrier to *considering* mainframe migration. Same pattern as [[Teleperformance]] — threat destroys equity before actual replacement. Updated bear case and related links.
- Updated [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] — added customer service outsourcing row + Week 4 "Anthropic reversal" section. Anthropic enterprise agents event (Feb 24) reversed the SaaSpocalypse narrative: partnerships with [[Intuit]], [[Salesforce]], [[DocuSign]], [[LegalZoom]], [[FactSet]], Gmail. Thomson Reuters +11%, FactSet +6%, Salesforce +4%. Wedbush: AI competition risk "overblown." Updated [[Intuit]] (Anthropic multi-year deal, MCP integrations, Claude Agent SDK, strategic analysis) and [[Anthropic]] (added Intuit partnership + cascade reversal links).
- [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026]] — full event note. Hegseth gave [[Dario Amodei]] until Friday 5:01 PM to grant unrestricted military access to [[Claude]] or face Defense Production Act invocation + supply-chain risk designation. [[Anthropic]] holding two red lines (autonomous weapons, mass surveillance). [[xAI]] approved for classified networks — breaks Anthropic's monopoly. DPA application to AI usage policies is genuinely unprecedented. Updated [[Anthropic]] actor note with Feb 23-25 escalation.
- [[Taalas]] — full actor note. Toronto startup that hardwires AI model weights directly into silicon transistors — the model IS the computer. Founded by Ljubisa Bajic (ex-Tenstorrent founder, ex-AMD/NVIDIA). HC1 chip: TSMC 6nm, 815mm², Llama 3.1 8B baked in. Claims 10x TPS + 20x lower cost vs GPU inference. No HBM, no CUDA, no software stack. 2-month model→chip turnaround via TSMC. $219M raised (Quiet Capital, Fidelity, Pierre Lamond), only $30M spent, $170M+ in bank. 25 employees. DeepSeek R1 demo: 12K TPS/user in 30-chip cluster. Sidesteps [[CUDA moat]] entirely. Tradeoff: model-locked chips. Created [[Jim Keller]] stub.

- [[AI distillation wars (2025-2026)]] — new event note. Full arc from DeepSeek R1 suspicions (Jan 2025) through OpenAI accusations (Feb 12) to Anthropic's granular disclosure (Feb 23): 24,000+ fake accounts, 16M+ exchanges across DeepSeek (150K, logic/alignment), Moonshot AI (3.4M, agentic reasoning), MiniMax (13M, agentic coding). Hydra cluster proxy networks. Timed to export controls debate — building case for API access restrictions. Hypocrisy angle: Anthropic's $1.5B Library Genesis settlement. Analysis: distillation complaints are rearguard action while labs sprint toward platform lock-in.
- [[Model distillation]] — new concept note. Technique, legitimate vs illicit use, IP landscape (copyright unprotectable, TOS unenforceable cross-border, trade secret doesn't fit), the hypocrisy loop, moat implications, detection/countermeasures.

### Guidance — Q1 FY2027

| Metric | Q1 FY27 Guide | Consensus | Beat |

| Revenue | $78.0B ±2% | $72.6B | +7.4% |
| Non-GAAP GM | 75.0% ±50bps | 74.96% | In line |

**Zero China DC compute revenue assumed in Q1 guide.** Any reopening is pure upside.

**SBC reclassification:** Starting Q1, SBC (~$1.9B/quarter) will be INCLUDED in non-GAAP measures, mechanically reducing reported non-GAAP EPS by ~$0.08/quarter vs prior methodology.

### Key developments

**Vera Rubin:** Shipped first samples to customers this week. Production shipments on track for H2 2026. 10x reduction in inference token cost vs Blackwell. 10x performance per watt. Six new chips in the platform. First deployers: [[AWS]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle]], [[CoreWeave]], [[Lambda Labs]], [[Nebius]].

**Blackwell:** Supply commitments rose from $50.3B (end Q3) to $95.2B (end Q4). Expects to EXCEED $500B combined Blackwell+Rubin manufacturing through CY2025-2026. Blackwell Ultra: 50x performance, 35x lower cost for agentic AI vs Hopper.

**Supply chain:** Blackwell GPUs now manufactured at [[TSMC]] Arizona. Rack-scale systems at new [[Foxconn]] plant in Mexico. Memory shortage expected as headwind to Gaming in Q1 FY27+.

**[[OpenAI]] deal:** Jensen: "We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement and believe we are close." Filing: "no assurance that a transaction will be completed."

**Jensen quotes:** "Computing demand is growing exponentially — the agentic AI inflection point has arrived." / "AI compute demand is 1,000 times greater than traditional compute. The need is a lot more than $700 billion." / "Our strategy is to introduce an entirely new AI infrastructure every single year."

Stock: Closed $195.56, rose to $202.92 AH (+3.5%), settled ~+0.7% by end of call. 63 analysts: 60 Buy, 2 Hold, 1 Sell. Consensus PT $261.54.

## Salesforce Q4 FY2026 — Agentforce inflection, guidance disappoints

[[Salesforce]] reported after the close. Q4 objectively strong — fastest growth in 2 years, massive EPS beat. Stock -5.6% AH on FY27 revenue guide midpoint that barely missed consensus ($46.0B vs $46.02B).

| Metric | Q4 FY26 | Y/Y |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $11.2B | +12% (fastest in 2 years) |
| Subscription & support | $10.7B | +13% (incl. $388M [[Informatica]]) |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $3.81 | Beat $3.04 est. (+25%) |
| Non-GAAP op margin | 34.1% | — |
| cRPO | $35.1B | +16% |
| Total RPO | $72B | +14% |
| OCF | $15.0B (FY26) | +15% |
| FCF | $14.4B (FY26) | +16% |

### Agentforce

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agentforce ARR | $800M (+169% Y/Y) |

| Pricing | $2 per conversation |

Customers: [[CrowdStrike]] using Claude in Agentforce; [[RBC]] Wealth Management deployed for 2,200 advisors managing $689B.

### FY2027 guidance

| Metric | Guide | Street |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Revenue | $45.8-46.2B (+10-11%) | $46.02B — slight miss |
| Non-GAAP op margin | 34.3% | — |
| FY2030 target | $63B (raised from $60B) | — |
| New buyback | $50B authorization | — |

Why it dropped: organic growth ex-[[Informatica]] only ~7-8%. Market wants proof $2/conversation model replaces per-seat SaaS at scale. Benioff spent the call defending seat compression — feeding the bear case.

### [[Anthropic]] partnership (day before earnings)

[[Dario Amodei]] and [[Marc Benioff]] unveiled "Claude for Agentforce 360" on Feb 24. [[Anthropic]] is the first LLM provider fully integrated within Salesforce's trust boundary — all Claude traffic contained within Salesforce's VPC. Claude gets native access to Data Cloud. Salesforce deploying Claude Code across engineering. [[Anthropic]] expanding Slack use. Context: part of the 10 enterprise partnerships that reversed the SaaSpocalypse narrative (see above).

## Snowflake Q4 FY2026 — beat across the board, guidance decelerates

[[Snowflake]] reported after the close. Clean beat on revenue, EPS, RPO. Stock initially +6% AH, then reversed to -2.5% on FY2027 guidance implying deceleration from 30% to 27%.

| Metric | Q4 FY26 | Y/Y |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Product revenue | $1.23B | +30% (beat $1.18B) |

|--------|-------|--------|
| Product revenue | $5.66B (~27% growth) | Beat ($5.50B) |
| Non-GAAP op margin | 12.5% | Up from ~9% FY26 |

AI revenue run rate exceeded $100M a quarter ahead of projections. [[Snowflake Intelligence]] (agentic AI, GA Nov 2025) adopted by 2,500+ customers. But [[Databricks]] comparison looms: at similar ~$5B revenue scale, Databricks growing 2x faster with 14x more AI revenue ($1.4B vs ~$100M).

**Observe acquisition:** $1B for AI-powered IT observability — largest acquisition ever (surpassing $800M [[Streamlit]], 2022). Targets $50B+ IT ops market.

## Axon Q4 — double beat, stock +22%

[[Axon]] reported. Revenue $797M (+39% Y/Y), adj EPS $2.15 (beat $1.60 est.). ARR ~$1.3B, net revenue retention 125%, adj EBITDA $206M (25.9% margin). GAAP net income just $3M (down from $135M) due to operating losses and strategic investment activities.

| Metric | Guidance |
|--------|---------|
| FY2026 revenue | $3.53-3.61B (+27-30%) vs $3.44B est. |
| FY2028 target | $6B revenue, ~28% adj EBITDA margins |

## Circle Q4 — +35.5%, first earnings as public company

[[Circle]] reported Q4 2025 revenue $770M, profit $133M — both beats. Stock surged 35.5% to $83.14. IPO'd June 2025 at $31/share (SPAC fell through in 2022, traditional IPO succeeded post-[[GENIUS Act]]). USDC market cap now part of ~$300B stablecoin market.

## DeepSeek V4 trained on banned Blackwell chips — federal investigation

**Reuters exclusive (Feb 25):** [[DeepSeek]] is withholding its latest V4 model from US chipmakers including [[NVIDIA]], giving early access to [[Huawei]] instead. A senior US official told Reuters that DeepSeek trained V4 on banned [[Blackwell]] chips — "likely clustered at its data center in Inner Mongolia" — potentially violating [[export controls]]. Federal investigation underway. This escalates the distillation controversy (above) into a direct export control violation story.

Previously, [[NVIDIA]] stated: "We're not shipping Blackwells to China." If confirmed, chips likely reached DeepSeek through gray market channels (see [[SEA chip diversion]]).

## AMD-Meta $60B strategic partnership

[[AMD]] and [[Meta]] announced an expanded strategic partnership (Feb 24): up to $60B of AI chips over 5 years, starting with 1GW of MI450 in H2 2026. Meta issued a performance-based warrant for up to 160M [[AMD]] shares. AMD +8.77% on the day. FT Lex: "AMD tries out the Kim Kardashian theory of data centres" — hopes Meta's endorsement attracts other hyperscalers. AMD also buying $150M of [[Nutanix]] stock in a separate cloud partnership.

## SCOTUS tariff ruling + Section 122 pivot

Supreme Court ruled 6-3 (Feb 20) that IEEPA does not authorize presidential tariffs. Trump responded with a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, effective Feb 24. Plans to raise to 15%. Key constraint: Section 122 has a 150-day limit and caps at 15% — far below prior IEEPA rates. EU postponed trade deal ratification. Steve Madden withdrew 2026 guidance entirely on tariff uncertainty.

DRAM operating margins now exceed 50-60% HBM margins from last year, but no chipmaker reverting — hyperscalers contracting for 3 years at fixed cost.

- [[Gene Munster]] — full actor note. 21-year Piper Jaffray veteran (Apple/Amazon/Google), now Deepwater co-founder. Vocal NVIDIA bull — CY2027 Street at 28% is "too conservative," expects 50%+
- [[Jensen 1000x compute thesis]] — new concept note. Jensen's argument from Q4 FY26 call: traditional compute = $350B/year of static "DVD" software; AI compute is real-time, generative, 1,000x more useful. $350B × 1,000 = massive TAM. Skeptical framing included (global GDP is $110T, timeline ambiguous). Supporting evidence from hyperscaler capex + agentic AI demand multiplier
- [[Piper Sandler]] — stub (formerly Piper Jaffray)
- Updated [[NVIDIA]] — added Munster/Deepwater post-call analysis + Jensen 1000x manifesto detail + supply/demand equilibrium paradox to Q4 section. Added Related links
