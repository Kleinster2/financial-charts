## Friday headlines (Jan 16)

### Canada-China tariff deal

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Canada gives | Lower tariffs on Chinese EVs |
| China gives | Lower duties on Canadian farm products |
| Context | US tariffs forcing realignment |

Effective US tariff rate on China: 37.4% (up from 2.2% in Jan 2025).

### Trump: Hassett not getting Fed Chair

Trump said Friday he wants Kevin Hassett to stay as NEC Director rather than become Fed Chair.

**Market reaction:**

| Tenor | Jan 15 | Jan 16 | Δ |
|-------|--------|--------|---|
| 2Y | 3.56% | 3.59% | +3bp |
| 5Y | 3.62% | 3.67% | +5bp |
| 10Y | 3.96% | 4.02% | +6bp |
| 30Y | 4.79% | 4.83% | +4bp |

Curve steepened — belly/long end rose on [[Kevin Warsh]] = fewer rate cuts. Warsh odds 39% → 60%, Hassett 80%+ → 16%.

**Evercore:** Powell investigation "making it harder to confirm Hassett... Warsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm."

| [[SK Hynix]] | $15B (incl $4B Indiana) |
| [[Micron]] | $200B ($150B mfg + $50B R&D) |

**Quote:** "Everyone who wants to build memory has two choices: They can pay a 100% tariff, or they can build in America. That's industrial policy."

**Micron:** Stock +7.8% Friday, +27% MTD, **+239% in 2025**.
