## 2026 Spring Festival Gala — humanoid robots take center stage

The [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]] (Feb 16, Year of the Horse) featured humanoid robots as a performance centerpiece for the second consecutive year. Four companies — [[Unitree]], [[MagicLab]], [[Galbot]], [[Noetix]] — paid ~100M yuan (~$14M) combined for gala partnerships. [[Unitree]]'s "Wu BOT" segment (with Henan Tagou Martial Arts School) showcased H1/H2 robots performing parkour, Drunken Fist, nunchaku, and trampoline backflips — a significant capability upgrade from 2025's Yangge dance. [[Noetix]]'s Bumi robots appeared in a comedy sketch; [[MagicLab]]'s humanoids danced in "We Are Made in China."

Separately, [[AGIBOT]] hosted "AgiBot Night 2026" — a 60-minute standalone event with 200+ humanoid robots as primary performers (Tai Chi, drunken fist, dance, magic, comedy), billed as the world's first robot-led gala.

Industry context: [[China]] shipped ~90% of the ~13,000 humanoid robots globally in 2025 (Omdia). 150+ humanoid companies, 50%+ annual growth. Both [[AGIBOT]] and [[Unitree]] are rumored IPO candidates for 2026. The gala functions as a government-endorsed showcase — [[Unitree]] founder [[Wang Xingxing]] met [[Xi Jinping]] weeks after the 2025 gala. Validates [[Humanoid robotics inflection]] thesis at the cultural/mainstream level.

Created [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]] (Events). Created stubs: [[MagicLab]], [[Galbot]], [[Noetix]] (Actors). Updated [[Unitree]], [[AGIBOT]].

## Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI; OpenClaw moves to foundation

[[Sam Altman]] announced (Feb 15) that [[Peter Steinberger]], founder of [[OpenClaw]] (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) and [[PSPDFKit]], is joining [[OpenAI]] to "drive the next generation of personal agents." Altman called him "a genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" and said "we expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

Separately, [[OpenClaw]] will move to an independent foundation: "OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support." Altman framed this as strategic: "The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that." This mirrors [[Anthropic]]'s open-standard strategy with [[MCP]] and [[Skills]] — both labs now backing open agent infrastructure to create ecosystem gravity.

OpenClaw context: 100K+ GitHub stars, 2M visitors in one week, viral growth since Nov 2025. China's industry ministry warned about security risks from improperly configured instances (Feb 5). Steinberger previously bootstrapped PSPDFKit for 13 years before exiting — Austrian engineer well-known in iOS/developer tools community. He tweeted about getting access to [[Aardvark]] (OpenAI's security agent) on Feb 14.

Updated [[OpenAI]], created [[OpenClaw]], [[Peter Steinberger]].

## Brynjolfsson: AI productivity take-off visible in data

Erik Brynjolfsson (FT, Feb 15) argues the [[Productivity J-curve]] has reached its harvest phase. US productivity grew ~2.7% in 2025, nearly double the prior decade's 1.4% average. BLS benchmark revision cut 403K payroll jobs while GDP stayed robust (Q4 +3.7%) — the decoupling signature of genuine productivity growth. Entry-level hiring in AI-exposed sectors down ~16%. Caveat: productivity metrics volatile, needs several more quarters to confirm. See [[Productivity]] for macro data, [[GS AI Productivity Beneficiaries]] for the trade.

## Unitree deep dive — "What makes Unitree, Unitree"

Added major new section to [[Unitree]] (Actors) synthesizing deep research on six dimensions: (1) Wang Xingxing's founder DNA — Ningbo origins, Zhejiang Sci-Tech → Shanghai University → DJI → quit at 26, XDog prototype, "good enough at 1/10th the price" philosophy; (2) Cost architecture — in-house PMSM rotary actuators, 12 identical motors per quadruped, Chinese supply chain leverage, injection-molded polymer chassis, commodity 18650 cells, vertical integration of motors/controllers/LiDAR/software; (3) Quadruped-to-humanoid bridge — 7 years of locomotion/balance/Sim2Real expertise ported to humanoids, explaining rapid H1/G1 capability ramp; (4) GTM strategy — consumer/education first (volume → data → cost flywheel → enterprise), classic Christensen disruption pattern, ~65% revenue from robot dogs, ~30% humanoids; (5) Hangzhou ecosystem — ZJU talent, government fast-tracking, YRD supply chain, real but replicable advantage; (6) Profitability mechanics — BOM analysis suggesting 50-65% gross margins on Go2, EDU variant ($12K) as high-margin upsell on same hardware, in-house components eliminating supplier markup. Sources: Simplexity teardown, Our China Story, Wikipedia, PanDaily, Mike Kalil, SCMP, Morgan Stanley analysis.

## Hangzhou Robotics Cluster — deep dive created

Created [[Hangzhou Robotics Cluster]] (Concepts) — comprehensive analysis of Hangzhou's emergence as China's quadruped/humanoid robotics capital. Key findings:

1. **ZJU pipeline**: 3 of 6 "Six Little Dragons" founded by ZJU alumni. ZJU produced 102 AI startup executives by Sep 2024 (#3 nationally). College of Control Science & Engineering → Deep Robotics; ISEE → DeepSeek; Chu Kochen College → Manycore Tech. Competition teams (RoboCup/ZJUDancer) serve as academic-to-commercial pipeline.

2. **Government support is systemic, not exceptional**: "Project Eagle" (2010) backed Unitree early. Binjiang District allocates ≥15% budget to high-tech. Zhejiang pioneered "chain leader system" (链长制, 2019). Xi Jinping was Zhejiang party secretary 2002-07 — personal patronage matters. Jan 2025: 15% of industrial policy funds earmarked for AI/humanoid robots, ¥300B annual investment target.

3. **Hangzhou is Tier 2 for robotics output but punches above weight in startups**: Shenzhen (¥179.7B), Shanghai (¥70B+), Guangzhou lead on output value. But Hangzhou dominates in quadruped/humanoid innovation density.

4. **YRD supply chain**: All robot components within 4-hour drive. Ningbo port 1.5h. Dual YRD+PRD access via Shenzhen subsidiaries.

5. **Moat is real but narrow**: Analogous to Israel's cybersecurity cluster — built on specific academic expertise + government speed + critical mass. Replicable with 10+ years and a catalytic institution, but Hangzhou has first-mover advantage that compounds.

Updated [[Unitree]] — expanded Hangzhou ecosystem subsection with Six Little Dragons framing, Project Eagle details, Binjiang District budget allocation, chain leader system, 200+ registered robotics companies, 4-hour supply chain, and link to new concept note.

## Unitree cost architecture deep dive

Expanded the "Cost architecture" subsection in [[Unitree]] from ~5 paragraphs to 8 detailed sections covering: (1) Actuator design — QDD architecture from MIT Mini Cheetah lineage, 36N42P outrunner BLDC with ~6.2:1 planetary reduction, integrated FOC driver, estimated $30-60/actuator at scale vs. $500-2,000 for harmonic drives used by [[Boston Dynamics]]; M107 humanoid motor at 189 N·m/kg peak torque density; (2) BOM breakdown — SemiAnalysis found $3,272 total component cost for ~$8,000 Go2 variant; base Go2 Air BOM estimated $500-800; Spot BOM estimated $15,000-25,000; (3) Manufacturing — injection-molded polymer chassis ($10-25/unit vs. $200-500+ for CNC aluminum), modular field-swappable legs; 10,000 sqm factory opened Apr 2025; (4) Component standardization — 12 identical actuators = 284,400 motors/year at current volume, driving commodity pricing; (5) Vertical integration — 90% of core components in-house per 36Kr, including motors, reducers, controllers, LiDAR, force sensors; [[Orbbec]] provides 72% of 3D vision; (6) Supply chain — named suppliers: Changsheng Bearings, Zhongda Lide, Weilan Lithium, Wolong Electric, Goldstone Technology, Lingyun Optical; RK3588 commodity SoC; (7) Margin structure — EDU variant at $8-12K on same hardware as $1,600 Air is the real business model (SDK = pure margin); Q1 2025 revenue 3.27B yuan, net profit 480M yuan; (8) Competitive replicability — structural advantage (Chinese supply chain + volume + 8yr vertical integration) analogous to [[DJI]] drone moat; [[Tesla]] Optimus is only credible threat via automotive-scale volumes.

## Unitree deep dive — Quadruped → Humanoid Bridge & Go-to-Market expansion

Significantly expanded two sections in [[Unitree]] under "What makes Unitree, Unitree":

**Quadruped → Humanoid Bridge** — expanded from 4 paragraphs to 6 detailed subsections: (1) Locomotion transfer — PPO/RL pipelines shared across Go2 and H1/G1 via `unitree_rl_gym`, domain randomization strategies refined on quadrupeds, teacher-student distillation, BumbleBee control system; (2) Shared hardware — M107 motor as scaled evolution of quadruped actuator (same PMSM + planetary + FOC architecture), shared compute (Jetson), shared sensors (Orbbec, LiDAR, force sensors); (3) Timeline advantage — Unitree went prototype to 5,500+ humanoid units in ~2 years vs. Tesla/Figure/Agility at 3-4+ years with zero mass production; (4) Sim-to-real pipeline — Isaac Gym/Lab training at 200Hz, MuJoCo validation, JIT deployment, Lingyun Optical motion capture integration; (5) Competitor disadvantages — cold-start companies (Figure, 1X) have no revenue, no data fleet, no supply chain; counterargument: Tesla's linear actuators and Figure's manipulation focus; (6) Academic ecosystem — Unitree as de facto standard platform for legged locomotion research (CMU, Stanford, ETH papers), published textbook, education-to-enterprise talent pipeline.

**Go-to-Market** — expanded from 3 paragraphs to 7 detailed subsections: (1) Consumer-first rationale — volume flywheel, deployment data, developer ecosystem, viral brand; (2) Education market — EDU variant as high-margin upsell ($8-12K on same $1,600 hardware), university procurement data (hundreds of orders, Stanford/CMU/MIT/ZJU), G1 EDU for humanoid research; (3) Developer ecosystem — 30+ open-source repos, ROS2 native via CycloneDDS, contrast with Boston Dynamics' locked SDK, "Best Overall Developer Experience" rating; (4) Enterprise migration — Great Wall Motors partnership (Apr 2025), BYD/Geely deployments, China Mobile ¥46M procurement, current factory roles (inspection, not assembly); (5) Channel strategy — omnichannel (Amazon, distributors, direct, enterprise, rental market); (6) Christensen disruption mapping — currently at Phase 3-4 transition, R1 at $5,900 as most aggressive disruption move; (7) Revenue mix evolution — humanoids went from 0% (2022) to ~45% (2025 est.), quadrupeds remain cash cow.

## Unitree profitability deep dive

Massively expanded the "Profitable since 2020" subsection in [[Unitree]] from 3 paragraphs to 9 detailed sections covering: (1) Revenue trajectory — estimated year-by-year from 2020 (~50-100M yuan) to Q1 2025 (3.27B yuan); institutional forecasts of 1.415B/1.856B/2.287B yuan net profit for 2025-2027; (2) Margin structure — >50% gross margins vs. [[FANUC]] 37%, [[ABB]] 33%, [[Boston Dynamics]] negative; Q1 2025 net margin 14.7%; humanoid margins ~8pp higher than quadruped per underwriting sources; (3) Unit economics by product — Go2 EDU as highest-margin product (82-88% gross), G1 humanoid and H1/B2 enterprise products as actual profit engines, Go2 Air as ecosystem loss leader; (4) R&D spending — estimated ~15% of revenue in 2024, dropping to ~5% in 2025 as revenue scales 10x; comparison to FANUC, ABB, Boston Dynamics; (5) Cash flow — likely cash flow positive since 2020, $264M raised is growth capital not survival capital; (6) Profitability vs. growth — cost structure permits both simultaneously; IPO preparation incentive acknowledged; (7) Pre-IPO financial scrutiny — accounts receivable, inventory, related-party transactions (Meituan 8.24% stake), government subsidies, R&D capitalization, revenue recognition timing; (8) Valuation at $7B — P/E ~36x on 2025E, P/S ~5-6x; bull case $15-20B, bear case Q1 was one-time; (9) Margin trajectory — humanoid mix shift likely holds or expands gross margins, DJI analog for trajectory.
