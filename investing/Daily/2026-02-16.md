## 2026 Spring Festival Gala — humanoid robots take center stage

The [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]] (Feb 16, Year of the Horse) featured humanoid robots as a performance centerpiece for the second consecutive year. Four companies — [[Unitree]], [[MagicLab]], [[Galbot]], [[Noetix]] — paid ~100M yuan (~$14M) combined for gala partnerships. [[Unitree]]'s "Wu BOT" segment (with Henan Tagou Martial Arts School) showcased H1/H2 robots performing parkour, Drunken Fist, nunchaku, and trampoline backflips — a significant capability upgrade from 2025's Yangge dance. [[Noetix]]'s Bumi robots appeared in a comedy sketch; [[MagicLab]]'s humanoids danced in "We Are Made in China."

Separately, [[AGIBOT]] hosted "AgiBot Night 2026" — a 60-minute standalone event with 200+ humanoid robots as primary performers (Tai Chi, drunken fist, dance, magic, comedy), billed as the world's first robot-led gala.

Industry context: [[China]] shipped ~90% of the ~13,000 humanoid robots globally in 2025 (Omdia). 150+ humanoid companies, 50%+ annual growth. Both [[AGIBOT]] and [[Unitree]] are rumored IPO candidates for 2026. The gala functions as a government-endorsed showcase — [[Unitree]] founder [[Wang Xingxing]] met [[Xi Jinping]] weeks after the 2025 gala. Validates [[Humanoid robotics inflection]] thesis at the cultural/mainstream level.

Created [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]] (Events). Created stubs: [[MagicLab]], [[Galbot]], [[Noetix]] (Actors). Updated [[Unitree]], [[AGIBOT]].

## Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI; OpenClaw moves to foundation

[[Sam Altman]] announced (Feb 15) that [[Peter Steinberger]], founder of [[OpenClaw]] (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) and [[PSPDFKit]], is joining [[OpenAI]] to "drive the next generation of personal agents." Altman called him "a genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" and said "we expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

Separately, [[OpenClaw]] will move to an independent foundation: "OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support." Altman framed this as strategic: "The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that." This mirrors [[Anthropic]]'s open-standard strategy with [[MCP]] and [[Skills]] — both labs now backing open agent infrastructure to create ecosystem gravity.

OpenClaw context: 100K+ GitHub stars, 2M visitors in one week, viral growth since Nov 2025. China's industry ministry warned about security risks from improperly configured instances (Feb 5). Steinberger previously bootstrapped PSPDFKit for 13 years before exiting — Austrian engineer well-known in iOS/developer tools community. He tweeted about getting access to [[Aardvark]] (OpenAI's security agent) on Feb 14.

Updated [[OpenAI]], created [[OpenClaw]], [[Peter Steinberger]].

## Brynjolfsson: AI productivity take-off visible in data

Erik Brynjolfsson (FT, Feb 15) argues the [[Productivity J-curve]] has reached its harvest phase. US productivity grew ~2.7% in 2025, nearly double the prior decade's 1.4% average. BLS benchmark revision cut 403K payroll jobs while GDP stayed robust (Q4 +3.7%) — the decoupling signature of genuine productivity growth. Entry-level hiring in AI-exposed sectors down ~16%. Caveat: productivity metrics volatile, needs several more quarters to confirm. See [[Productivity]] for macro data, [[GS AI Productivity Beneficiaries]] for the trade.

Created [[Productivity J-curve]].
