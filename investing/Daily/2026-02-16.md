## Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI; OpenClaw moves to foundation

[[Sam Altman]] announced (Feb 15) that [[Peter Steinberger]], founder of [[OpenClaw]] (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) and [[PSPDFKit]], is joining [[OpenAI]] to "drive the next generation of personal agents." Altman called him "a genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" and said "we expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

Separately, [[OpenClaw]] will move to an independent foundation: "OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support." Altman framed this as strategic: "The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that." This mirrors [[Anthropic]]'s open-standard strategy with [[MCP]] and [[Skills]] — both labs now backing open agent infrastructure to create ecosystem gravity.

OpenClaw context: 100K+ GitHub stars, 2M visitors in one week, viral growth since Nov 2025. China's industry ministry warned about security risks from improperly configured instances (Feb 5). Steinberger previously bootstrapped PSPDFKit for 13 years before exiting — Austrian engineer well-known in iOS/developer tools community. He tweeted about getting access to [[Aardvark]] (OpenAI's security agent) on Feb 14.

Updated [[OpenAI]], created [[OpenClaw]], [[Peter Steinberger]].

## Brynjolfsson: AI productivity take-off visible in data

Erik Brynjolfsson (FT, Feb 15) argues the [[Productivity J-curve]] has reached its harvest phase. US productivity grew ~2.7% in 2025, nearly double the prior decade's 1.4% average. BLS benchmark revision cut 403K payroll jobs while GDP stayed robust (Q4 +3.7%) — the decoupling signature of genuine productivity growth. Entry-level hiring in AI-exposed sectors down ~16%. Caveat: productivity metrics volatile, needs several more quarters to confirm. See [[Productivity]] for macro data, [[GS AI Productivity Beneficiaries]] for the trade.
