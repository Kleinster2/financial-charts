### Japan — Deep-sea rare earth mining mission launched

Japan's research vessel Chikyu departed Shizuoka for Minamitori Island — world's first attempt to continuously lift rare earth mud from 6km depth.

- 40B yen ($250M) invested since 2018
- Japan's China REE dependence: 90% (2010) → 60% (now)
- Heavy REEs ([[Dysprosium]], [[Terbium]]): still ~100% China-dependent
- Chinese naval fleet observed near site during June 2025 surveys
- G7 finance ministers discussed rare earth supplies same day (Washington)
- Mission returns Feb 14; full-scale trial planned Feb 2027

**Implication:** Japan's only path to domestic rare earth production. Long-term play (5-10+ years) but accelerated by [[China-Japan relations]] escalation.
