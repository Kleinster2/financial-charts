## Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing ingested

Created comprehensive event note from the Feb 3 Senate hearing on the Netflix-Warner Bros merger ($83B all-cash deal).

**Key regulatory question:** Market definition. If SVOD-only → Netflix+HBO exceeds 30% share (presumption of illegality). If all TV viewing (including YouTube at ~13%) → combined is only ~10%.

**Political dynamics:** Trump bought $2M in NFLX/WBD bonds post-announcement. Heritage Foundation lobbying against. Republican senators used hearing to attack Netflix content ("woke"/"transgender ideology") rather than focus on competition.

Sarandos pledged 45-day theatrical windows **under oath**. Paramount Skydance has rival $108B hostile bid.

## Dreame Technology — vacuum maker pivoting to EVs

- EV pivot: "Nebula" luxury electric supercar, plant in Brandenburg Germany, target 2027
- $1.5B CVC fund launched Aug 2025

## China memory makers abandon low-price strategy

Updated memory shortage note with China pricing dynamics. **The "China will flood market with cheap memory" narrative is dead.**

- [[CXMT]] denied dumping DDR4 at discounts — prices converging toward Korean levels
- [[YMTC]] also not underpricing NAND contract rates
- CXMT DDR5 dies **40-50% larger** than SK Hynix (no EUV) — cost disadvantage at volume
- Regulatory walls: YMTC on Entity List, CXMT flagged under Section 1260H
- Domestic demand absorbs all supply — no surplus for export

**Investment implication:** Bullish [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]]. Chinese competition won't pressure memory pricing through 2026-2027.

### Notes updated

| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | Concept | Added China pricing section — CXMT/YMTC abandoning low-price strategy |

## Bedrock Robotics — autonomous construction

Created actor note for [[Bedrock Robotics]], autonomous construction equipment startup founded 2024 by ex-[[Waymo]] engineers. Retrofits existing excavators/bulldozers with AI autonomy stack rather than building new machines.

- $350M+ raised, $1.75B valuation (Feb 2026 Series B)
- CEO [[Boris Sofman]]: CMU Robotics PhD → [[Anki]] co-founder → [[Waymo]] Head of Trucking
- All 4 co-founders ex-[[Waymo]]
- Nov 2025: first large-scale supervised autonomy deployment (130-acre site)
- 2026 target: first fully operator-less excavator deployments
- Market driver: US construction needs ~349K new workers in 2026, 8-month project backlogs

Closest comp: [[Built Robotics]] (same retrofit model, less funded). Also in space: [[Gravis Robotics]], [[SafeAI]], [[Teleo]], [[Forterra]], [[Overland AI]].

Created [[Off-road autonomy]] concept note tying the space together — AV tech transfer from highways to construction, mining, defense, oilfield. Two clusters: construction autonomy (Bedrock, Built, Gravis, SafeAI, Teleo) and defense autonomy (Forterra, Overland AI). [[Kodiak AI]] (KDK, public) straddles both — autonomous trucking + Permian Basin oilfield ops.

## Insurify insurance broker selloff — AI disintermediation hits insurance

[[Insurify]] launched the first insurance app in [[OpenAI]]'s ChatGPT app directory — an AI comparison tool drawing on 196M+ auto quotes. Insurance broker stocks sold off hard, echoing the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] from the prior week.

Market impact (Feb 9):

| Ticker | Company | Move |
|--------|---------|------|
| WTW | [[Willis Towers Watson]] | -12% (worst since Nov 2008) |
| AJG | [[Arthur J. Gallagher]] | -9.9% |
| AON | [[Aon]] | -9.3% |
| RYAN | [[Ryan Specialty]] | -8.5% |
| BRO | [[Brown & Brown]] | -7.8% |
| MMC | [[Marsh McLennan]] | -6.1% |

S&P 500 Insurance index -3.9% (biggest drop since October). Carriers ([[Chubb]], [[Travelers]], [[Progressive]]) down only 1-2% — market punished the distribution layer, not the underwriters.

Same pattern as the SaaSpocalypse: AI disintermediates the middleman. Created [[AI disintermediation]] concept note tying both events together with the historical precedent arc (stockbrokers 1990s → travel agents 2000s → taxi dispatchers 2010s → real estate agents 2020s → software/insurance middlemen 2026).

Key difference from SaaSpocalypse: that was a capabilities demonstration (Cowork plugins could do the work). This was a distribution play (Insurify inside ChatGPT's 300M+ user platform). Distribution may be more immediately threatening than capability alone.

## Altruist Hazel AI — third disintermediation shock in 8 days

[[Altruist]] launched AI-powered tax planning in its Hazel platform — reads 1040s, paystubs, statements, meeting notes, CRM data and generates personalized tax strategies in minutes. $60/seat/month. Wealth management stocks sold off as the third [[AI disintermediation]] shock in 8 days.

| Ticker | Company | Move |
|--------|---------|------|
| RJF | [[Raymond James]] | -8.5% |
| LPLA | [[LPL Financial]] | -8.4% |
| SCHW | [[Charles Schwab]] | -8.1% |
| SF | [[Stifel Financial]] | -7.2% |

The three shocks in sequence:

| Date | Trigger | Target | Worst hit |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Feb 3-8 | [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026\|SaaSpocalypse]] | Software/data middlemen | TRI -20%, RELX -14% |
| Feb 9 | [[Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026\|Insurify selloff]] | Insurance brokers | WTW -12%, AJG -9.9% |
| Feb 10 | [[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026\|Altruist selloff]] | Wealth managers | RJF -8.5%, SCHW -8.1% |

All three follow the same pattern: AI commoditizes the advisory/comparison layer, sparing the production layer (carriers, databases, custody infrastructure).

IBKR (+15% YTD) completely immune — pure execution platform with no advisory pretension. Suggests the market is pricing in destruction of advisory margins specifically, not brokerage/custody infrastructure.

## AIFD basket — AI Financial Disintermediation index

Created [[AI financial disintermediation basket|AIFD]] — companion to [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]]. 10 constituents (6 insurance brokers + 4 wealth managers), move-weighted from the Feb 9-10 selloffs.

AIWD = software/data product replacement (seats → agents). AIFD = financial services advisory replacement (human middlemen → AI tools).

![[aifd-vs-aiwd-vs-spy-price-chart.png]]
*AIFD (blue) vs AIWD (red) vs SPY (green) since Jan 2024. SPY +48%, AIFD flat, AIWD -18%. AIFD is where AIWD was a week ago — earlier in the repricing cycle. If the thesis keeps expanding, AIFD follows AIWD down.*

## Taiwan specialty memory — database + vault buildout

Added four Taiwan/Japan memory tickers and built out vault coverage for the non-Big Three memory beneficiaries of the [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]].

All three Taiwan names have gone parabolic — up 383-851% in the past year — as [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], and [[Micron]] exit commodity DRAM/NOR for [[HBM]], leaving these niche players with unprecedented pricing power.

| Company | Ticker | 1yr return | Angle |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| [[Nanya Technology]] | 2408.TW | +851% | #4 DRAM, DDR4 pricing inversion, Q4 gross margin 18%→49% in one quarter |
| [[Winbond Electronics]] | 2344.TW | +648% | #1 NOR flash + top-5 DRAM, dual shortage exposure, 2027 capacity pre-sold |
| [[Macronix]] | 2337.TW | +383% | #2 NOR flash, 3D NOR pioneer (sampling H2 2026), still unprofitable |
| [[Kioxia]] | 285A.T | — | Updated existing note with ticker, public status |

DDR4 now trades at a 67% premium to DDR5 — a pricing inversion driven by supply collapse. [[Nanya Technology]] expects shortage through 1H 2027. [[Winbond Electronics]] has 2027 DRAM capacity already fully pre-sold. NOR flash prices expected to rise 40-50% QoQ in Q2 2026.

### Notes created

| Note | Type | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| [[Nanya Technology]] | Actor | New — DDR4 beneficiary, [[Formosa Plastics Group]] subsidiary, record Q4 |

| [[Microsoft bonds]] | $46.2B | AAA/Aaa | No new cash bond issuance since Jan 2017 — only exchange offers + assumed Activision debt |
| [[Amazon bonds]] | $68.8B | AA | May 2021 record-low corporate spreads (+10bp), new S-3ASR shelf filed Feb 2026 |
| [[Intel bonds]] | $47.2B | BBB/Baa2 | 7 downgrades from A+/A1 in under 3 years, fair value 11.5% discount to face |

Updated all six parent actor notes ([[Apple]], [[Oracle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Meta]], [[Amazon]], [[Intel]]) with debt profile sections, Quick stats LT debt lines, and Related links.

**Combined outstanding:** ~$466B across seven companies (including [[Alphabet bonds|Alphabet]]'s $25.2B). [[Oracle]] alone accounts for ~29% of the total.
