## Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing ingested

Created comprehensive event note from the Feb 3 Senate hearing on the Netflix-Warner Bros merger ($83B all-cash deal).

**Key regulatory question:** Market definition. If SVOD-only → Netflix+HBO exceeds 30% share (presumption of illegality). If all TV viewing (including YouTube at ~13%) → combined is only ~10%.

**Political dynamics:** Trump bought $2M in NFLX/WBD bonds post-announcement. Heritage Foundation lobbying against. Republican senators used hearing to attack Netflix content ("woke"/"transgender ideology") rather than focus on competition.

Sarandos pledged 45-day theatrical windows **under oath**. Paramount Skydance has rival $108B hostile bid.

## China memory makers abandon low-price strategy

Updated memory shortage note with China pricing dynamics. **The "China will flood market with cheap memory" narrative is dead.**

- [[CXMT]] denied dumping DDR4 at discounts — prices converging toward Korean levels
- [[YMTC]] also not underpricing NAND contract rates
- CXMT DDR5 dies **40-50% larger** than SK Hynix (no EUV) — cost disadvantage at volume
- Regulatory walls: YMTC on Entity List, CXMT flagged under Section 1260H
- Domestic demand absorbs all supply — no surplus for export

**Investment implication:** Bullish [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]]. Chinese competition won't pressure memory pricing through 2026-2027.

### Notes updated

| Note | Type | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | Concept | Added China pricing section — CXMT/YMTC abandoning low-price strategy |
