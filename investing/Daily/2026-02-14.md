## Ones and Tooze — AI capex bubble typology + German economy under Merz

*[[Adam Tooze]] & Cameron Abadi, Foreign Policy podcast (Feb 14, 2026)*

### Segment 1: AI capex — $650B and the bubble question

Hyperscaler capex trajectory:

| Year | Capex | % of US GDP | YoY increment |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024 | ~$240B | ~0.8% | — |
| 2025 | ~$450B | ~1.5% | +0.7pp |
| 2026E | ~$650B | ~2.0% | +0.7pp |

$650B figure extrapolated from Q1 2026 plans of [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]]. Against US GDP of $30T, this is ~2% — comparable to prior US tech booms but below 19th-century railroad spending.

**Macro mechanics:** Each 0.7pp annual increment functions as Keynesian stimulus — construction, chip purchases, workforce multipliers. Some leakage to imports ([[TSMC]] chips). Regional concentration effects: Virginia (data centers), Bay Area (wealth generation). At points in early 2025, AI capex was the only positive growth driver while the rest of the economy contracted.

**Parallel:** ~30% of [[China]]'s growth currently driven by new energy sector. If 20-30% of US growth were AI-driven, that would be comparable.

**Tooze's bubble typology — three scenarios:**

1. **Metaverse scenario** — technology doesn't prove useful; money spent, nothing comes of it
2. **Railways scenario** — technology is transformative but revenue timeline mismatches financial obligations; repeated financial crises despite real value
3. **Airlines scenario** — technology transforms the world but can't be monetized; great for consumers, terrible for investors (Chinese involution parallel, [[Warren Buffett]] "moat" framing)

**K-shaped economy overlay:** AI boom sits on one side of a seesaw, rest of US economy deflating on the other. Could tip either way — recession if non-AI economy collapses, or inflation if it accelerates.

**Household exposure risk:** 21% of US household wealth now in equities (record). Market cap concentration in ~20 stocks, mostly AI-exposed. A dotcom-level correction could mean $10T+ in wealth losses. Unlike 2008, this is equity-based (not leveraged lending), so unlikely to trigger financial crisis — more likely a wealth-effect recession. Historical wealth effect ~2-3% (lose $100, spend $2-3 less), but recent data shows weak wealth effect in both directions.

**AI disruption already visible:** [[Thomson Reuters]] saw major sell-off on expectations that AI agents will displace legal database services like Westlaw.

### Segment 2: German economy under Merz — stagnation and defense

**Stagnation data:** [[Germany]] has grown 0.1% since 2019. Worst five-year stretch in Federal Republic history (since 1949). Comparison: US +12%, [[EU]] average +4%. Even [[Italy]] has outgrown Germany.

**Merz's dual approach:**
- *Demand side (positive):* [[Schuldenbremse reform]] — fiscal stimulus, infrastructure fund, defense exemption. Takes time to work but is overdue.
- *Supply side (populist):* Targeting part-time work ("Teilzeitarbeit aus Lifestyle-Grunden") and telephone sick notes. Tooze: this is supply-side policy for dummies.

**Working hours comparison:** German workers ~1,300 hrs/year vs US ~1,750 hrs/year — Americans work 25-30% more. Germany also has high sickness absenteeism. But the rational explanation is childcare availability (France outperforms), not malingering.

**"Buy European" vs "Made with Europe":** [[France]] pushes "buy European" (procurement preference). [[Germany]] prefers "made with Europe" (supply chain integration, less protectionist). France's EV subsidy uses carbon standards — Chinese EVs produced with coal power don't qualify, French nuclear-powered production does.

**Three sources of German frustration with France:**
1. [[EU-Mercosur agreement]] — French block in EU Parliament
2. FCAS (next-gen fighter) — [[Dassault Aviation]] uncooperative with [[Airbus]] on technology sharing; Paris hasn't intervened
3. "Buy European" protectionism

**Merz-Meloni alignment:** Germany and [[Italy]] positioning as manufacturing powers. [[Leonardo]] as potential [[Rheinmetall]]/[[Airbus]] defense partner. Ironic given Scholz's fear of post-fascist Italian government. Limited by Italian debt constraints — Italy needs EU common debt to match German defense spending.

**Bundeswehr spending:** Could reach **$189B by 2029** — dwarfing [[France]], [[UK]], [[Italy]], Spain. Merz has openly stated he wants Germany as Europe's leading military power. No previous chancellor has said this.

**Structural imbalance:** France/Italy/Spain can't match German defense spending without EU common debt issuance. EU SAFE lending package ~EUR 160B is smaller than Germany's projected national defense budget. Who decides on common debt? Germany. This leaves other European states with limited options — essentially free-riding on German investment.

**European army logic:** Combined European defense spending already ~2x Russia's. A single European force would have full-spectrum capability (nuclear, space, cyber, naval). National budgets, even Germany's $189B, cannot achieve this alone. Historical precedent: original 1950s plan was a European Defense Community (joint Franco-German army), rejected by French parliament in 1954 — NATO membership was the fallback.

**[[Poland]] hedging:** Defense spending at 4-5% of GDP — driven by distrust of Germany's reliability as a security partner, not just Russia threat.
