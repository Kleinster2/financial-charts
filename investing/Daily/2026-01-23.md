## Markets

S&P 500 closed 6,916 (+0.03%), Nasdaq 23,501 (+0.28%), Dow 49,099 (-0.58%) on Jan 23. Goldman Sachs -4% weighed on Dow. [[Intel]] -14% after hours on weak Q1 guidance (see below). [[NVIDIA]] +1.6% on China H200 reports. [[AMD]] +2.3%. Gold hit fresh record high overnight. Second consecutive weekly loss for S&P/Nasdaq.

**Michigan sentiment:** 56.4 (beat 54.0 est., +6.6% MoM). 1-year inflation expectations fell to 4.0% (lowest since Jan 2025). Geopolitical turmoil failed to dent confidence.

**Week ahead:** Mag 7 earnings — [[Meta]], [[Microsoft]], [[Tesla]] (Wed), [[Apple]] (Thu). First Fed meeting of 2026 (Jan 28-29, 88% hold). House passed all 12 appropriations bills — shutdown by Jan 30 deadline now virtually assured to be avoided.

**Today's earnings:** SLB, [[Ericsson]], Booz Allen Hamilton, First Citizens BancShares, Webster Financial. Procter & Gamble reported mixed results (weak Gillette/Pampers demand), -2%.

## Intel Q4 earnings miss on guidance (Jan 23, after hours)

[[Intel]] stock -14% (to $46.75) after CEO Lip-Bu Tan warned manufacturing yields are too low to meet demand. Q4 beat estimates but Q1 guidance badly missed.

| Metric | Q4 actual | Q1 guidance | Wall Street est |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $13.7B (beat $13.4B) | $11.7-12.7B | $12.6B |
| EPS (adj) | $0.15 (beat $0.09) | Break-even | $0.08 |
| Gross margin | 37.9% | 34.5% | — |

**Root cause:** Low manufacturing yields → burned through inventory in Q4 → server chip supply won't recover until end of Q1. Demand is strong but Intel can't produce enough. CapEx boost won't yield output until 2027.

**Context:** Stock had surged 84% in 2025 on turnaround optimism (NVIDIA $5B investment, US government stake, Panther Lake 18A launch). This is a setback for the execution narrative.

## US 25% semiconductor tariff + NVIDIA China deal (Section 232, Jan 14)

**The biggest semiconductor policy shift since export controls.** Two things happened simultaneously:

1. **25% tariff** on advanced AI chips under Section 232
2. **NVIDIA gets China access** — H200 exports approved under new "managed access" framework (replacing Biden's "presumption of denial")

This is industrial policy disguised as a national security tariff.

---

### Tariff structure

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Rate | **25%** ad valorem |
| Authority | **Section 232** (Trade Expansion Act 1962) |
| Effective | January 15, 2026, 12:01 AM EST |
| Targets | Chips with TPP 14,000-21,100, DRAM bandwidth >4,500 GB/s |
| Named chips | [[NVIDIA]] H200, [[AMD]] MI325X |
| Future chips covered | NVIDIA Rubin R100 (3nm/HBM4), AMD MI455X (2nm/432GB HBM4) |
| Revenue estimate | **$4-6B/year** → funds domestic manufacturing |
| Cost per GPU | ~$12K additional (analyst est.) |

**Why Section 232 (not IEEPA):** Supreme Court currently reviewing legality of IEEPA tariffs. Section 232 is on firmer legal ground — follows 9-month Commerce Department investigation.

**No tariff stacking:** Section 232 semiconductor tariff takes precedence over IEEPA Reciprocal, IEEPA Canada, and IEEPA Mexico tariffs.

---

### Exemptions (critical for investment thesis)

The tariff does NOT apply to chips imported for:

| Exempt use | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **US data centers** | Hyperscalers ([[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Meta]], [[Amazon]]) unaffected |
| US R&D | Research labs exempt |
| US startups | "Startup Shield" |
| Non-DC consumer/industrial | Edge devices, automotive, etc. exempt |
| US public sector | Government/military exempt |
| Domestic repairs | Replacement chips exempt |
| Uses strengthening US supply chain | Secretary can grant additional |

**Bottom line:** The tariff primarily hits **re-exports** (chips transiting US to non-exempt foreign buyers, especially China). US domestic consumption is largely protected.

---

### NVIDIA China deal mechanics

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Framework | "Managed access" (replaces "presumption of denial") |
| Volume cap | China sales ≤ **50% of US domestic volume** |
| Verification | Every shipment → US third-party lab testing |
| Routing | Taiwan → **US** → China (chips must detour through US) |
| First shipment | **82,000 H200 GPUs**, mid-February 2026 |
| Tariff bearer | NVIDIA (passes to Chinese buyers) |

**Requirements for China buyers:**
- Security screening
- Must demonstrate export won't impact US customer demand
- Case-by-case BIS license approval (weeks to months)

**Uncertainty:** Chinese regulators haven't yet approved H200 imports on their side.

---

### Political dynamics

| Side | Position |
|------|----------|
| **NVIDIA** | "Applauds" — lobbied hard for China access |
| **Democrats** | "Selling out national security for revenue" |
| **Matt Pottinger** (ex-Trump Asia advisor) | "Wrong track" — hurts US in AI race |
| **AMD** | Complies with "all US export control laws and policies" |
| **TSMC** | Stock initially dipped, then rebounded on $250B deal |

---

### Escalation roadmap (!!!)

| Phase | Timeline | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1** (current) | Jan 15, 2026 | 25% on narrow advanced AI chips |
| **Review** | Jul 1, 2026 | Commerce updates President — may modify |
| **Potential Phase 2** | If milestones missed | Could escalate to **100%** |
| **Phase 3** | **Jun 2027** | Legacy/mature-node chips folded in |

**Phase 3 significance:** Automotive and medical device industries get "glide path" to source domestic alternatives before legacy chip tariffs hit. This is the long-term endgame — all semiconductor imports eventually tariffed.

**FTZ note:** Chips entering Foreign Trade Zones after Jan 15 must be classified at entry — can't defer tariff through FTZ storage.

---

### US-Taiwan $250B semiconductor deal (Jan 15)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Commitment | **$250B** in US semiconductor, energy, AI manufacturing |
| Lead entity | [[TSMC]] + Taiwanese enterprises |
| TSMC benefit | "Preferential Section 232 treatment" — **duty-free imports** |
| Condition | Tied to US fabrication investment milestones |
| New fabs | Five additional TSMC fabrication plants in Arizona |
| Timing | 2026-2028 domestic capacity coming online |

**The carrot:** TSMC gets tariff exemptions proportional to its US investment. Convert tariffs into industrial policy tools — the more you build in US, the less you pay.

**Intel parallel:** Intel domestic fabs also positioned to benefit as tariff pressure drives customers toward US-manufactured chips.

---

### Investment implications

| Actor | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **[[NVIDIA]]** | **Mixed** — China revenue reopened ($10B+ opportunity) but 25% tariff eats margin. Net positive near-term. |
| **[[AMD]]** | **Slightly negative** — MI325X tariffed, no announced China deal |
| **[[TSMC]]** | **Positive** — $250B deal, preferential treatment, more Arizona fabs |
| **[[Intel]]** | **Positive** — domestic manufacturing advantage, exempt from import tariffs |
| **Hyperscalers** | **Neutral** — exempted from tariff for US data center use |
| **Chinese buyers** | **Negative** — 25% premium + verification delays + volume caps |
| **Huawei/Ascend** | **Complex** — H200 availability reduces urgency for Chinese alternatives |

**The bigger picture:** This is the first time the US government has explicitly monetized semiconductor exports to China through a tariff. Previous approach was pure restriction. New approach: controlled access + revenue.

## Greenland tariff crisis → resolution

**Timeline:**
- **Jan 17:** Trump announces 10% tariff on Denmark + 7 European nations (→ 25% by June) unless Greenland purchase deal
- **Jan 20:** Markets sell off — Dow -800, S&P -2%+
- **Jan 21 (Davos):** Trump-Rutte "framework of a future deal" → tariffs paused, force ruled out
- **Jan 22-23:** Markets rally on relief

**Framework details unclear.** NATO says it focuses on "Arctic security through collective efforts of Allies." Denmark says Trump "ruled out force" and "paused the trade war." No sovereignty concessions.

**200% French champagne/wine tariff** also threatened (to get France to join "Board of Peace") — status uncertain.

## China macro

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q4 2025 GDP | **4.5%** YoY (slowest since late 2022) |
| 2025 full year | **5.0%** (hit target, driven by exports) |
| 2026 forecast | **4.3-4.5%** (Deutsche Bank / JPM) |
| PBOC LPR | Held 3%/3.5% (8th straight month) |
| Population 2025 | 1,404.89M (**-3.39M** vs 2024) |
| Births 2025 | **7.92M** |

**Policy pivot:** "Expanding domestic consumption" is top 2026 priority. Exports carried 2025 but not sustainable under tariff pressure.

**15th Five-Year Plan begins 2026:** AI, robotics, quantum, biomanufacturing, 6G get targeted support. Bridge to 2035 modernization goals.

**AI momentum:** Xi's New Year address highlighted AI models "competing in a race to the top." Biren IPO blockbuster. Baidu chip unit filed for HK listing.

## Fed outlook

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current rate | **3.50-3.75%** |
| Jan 27-28 meeting | **88.4% hold** probability |
| 2026 dot plot | 1 additional cut (→ 3.25-3.50%) |
| Market pricing | 2 cuts in 2026 (→ ~3%) |
| PCE | Still above 2% target |
| Powell term expires | **May 15, 2026** |

**Internal division:** Dec cut was not unanimous — Miran wanted 50bp cut, Goolsbee and Schmid wanted hold.

**Political pressure:** DOJ criminal investigation of Fed (Powell: "effort to intimidate"). Trump wants much lower rates.

**Transition:** New Chair expected after May. Likely path: pause early 2026, new Chair may cut 1-2 times in H2.

## Trade: Supreme Court IEEPA challenge

Supreme Court to rule on legality of tariffs imposed under IEEPA. If found unlawful, opens thorny refund question for importers. Trump's semiconductor tariff uses Section 232 instead — likely anticipating adverse IEEPA ruling.

## Davos 2026: Sacks/Kratsios AI policy panel (Jan 23)

**Panel:** [[David Sacks]] (AI/Crypto Czar), [[Michael Kratsios]] (US CTO), moderated by Maria Bartiromo.

Most detailed public articulation of Trump administration AI policy. Key positions:

### US position in AI race
- US ahead at every layer: models (~6mo), chips (~2yr), equipment (~5yr)
- China advantages: (1) energy — grid doubled in 10 years vs US 2-3%, (2) AI optimism — 83% vs 39% (Stanford)
- Infrastructure buildout added ~2% to GDP growth in 2025 (helped reach 4-5%)
- "No such thing as a dark GPU right now" — not a dot-com repeat

### AI applications evolution
- Coding assistants: "real breakthrough" in past few months, "mind-blowing" per developers
- Highlighted [[Anthropic]]'s Claude Code / Opus 4.5 as product "everyone's going crazy over"
- 2026 prediction: knowledge worker tools (Excel, PowerPoints, websites) + personal digital assistants
- AI for science: "Genesis Mission" launched — DOE national labs data for model training
- Science targets: fusion simulations, materials science, therapeutics
- Goal: "Almost double our R&D output over the next 10 years because of AI"

### Data centers and power
- Bernie Sanders: stop all DCs. Sacks: "If we do that we will lose the AI race"
- Microsoft pledged (week of Jan 20) DCs won't cause residential rate increases
- Biden had blocked behind-the-meter generation — Wright/FERC reversed
- Trump vision: "Let AI companies become power companies"
- Sacks: DCs will actually BRING DOWN rates (sell excess + amortize fixed costs)

### Regulation
- 1,200+ state AI bills — "knee-jerk reactions" hurting startups most
- Working on bipartisan federal framework (60 votes needed)
- EU AI Act: "Bad case of main character syndrome" — passed before ChatGPT existed
- Rescinded 300 pages of Biden AI/semiconductor regulations in first week

### China/Huawei strategy
- China blocking NVIDIA imports to stand up [[Huawei]] as national champion
- Plan: Huawei dominates China → scale → global proliferation (telecom playbook repeated)
- [[DeepSeek]] (early 2025) "put Chinese AI on the map" — ended Western complacency
- American AI Export Program: Commerce RFP "very shortly", turnkey packages, DFC/Ex-Im financing
- Winning metric: "If in 5 years it's American chips and models everywhere, we won"
- India AI Impact Summit (Feb 2026) — next milestone

### Risks
- Orwellian misuse: surveillance, censorship, political bias in AI
- Biden EO had 20 pages of DEI → led to "black George Washington" (Gemini)
- Trump EO: federal government won't procure politically biased AI
- Jobs: Elon "directionally correct" about abundance, but won't put everyone out of work

## Defense sector: valuations stretched, growth accelerating (Jan 23)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sector performance | **+55%** past year |
| Global military spending (2025) | **>$2.5T** |
| Global military spending (2027E) | **>$3T** (double-digit growth, Global X) |
| Large US defense P/E | **24x** (up from 16x a year ago) |
| Expected 2026 EPS growth | **+15%** (vs 6% historical avg) |

**Analyst picks:**

| Analyst | Firm | Picks |
|---------|------|-------|
| Stallard | Vertical Research | [[General Dynamics]], [[L3Harris]] |
| Kahyaoglu | Jefferies | [[L3Harris]] spinoff (30% combined upside) |
| DiPalma | William Blair | [[AeroVironment]], [[Kratos]] (drones "red hot") |
| Herbert | RBC Capital | [[Northrop Grumman]] (space + nuclear) |

**L3Harris missile spinoff:** Spinning out Aerojet missile business as public company. DoD investing $1B. Missiles trade at higher multiples than diversified primes.

**Drone stocks:** AVAV at $312 (90x, +28% YTD), KTOS at $114 (106x, +50% YTD). Both pricier than NVIDIA. [[Golden Dome]] driving backlogs.

**Risk:** Trump EO could force companies "falling behind on technology development and production" to cut dividends and suspend buybacks. Herbert reads this as signal to increase investment and prepare for growth.

## Meme stocks turn 5: GameStop retrospective (Barron's, Jan 23)

Five years after [[GameStop]]'s Jan 28, 2021 peak ($120.75 split-adjusted), Barron's assesses the legacy:

**Systemic near-miss:** Thomas Peterffy ([[Interactive Brokers]]) reveals how close the system came to collapse — brokers would have been forced to recall shares from shorts, but SI exceeded float. "Wall Street would have collapsed." The vulnerabilities remain unpatched.

**GameStop today:** $8.8B cash + $519M Bitcoin, $4.16B debt. Market cap $10.4B. Closing 470 stores. Cohen: "The business would be bankrupt by now" without equity raises.

**Retail flows permanent:** Self-directed retail flows remain $1-3B daily (VandaTrack) vs $0-1B pre-pandemic. [[Robinhood]] retained 90% of Jan 2021 accounts; now at 26.9M funded customers. [[Reddit]] investment posts +49%, personal finance +117% since 2020.

**Wall Street adapted:** VandaTrack for institutional risk management. Companies pre-file shelf registrations. Trading desks monitor X/Reddit. Roundhill relaunched MEME ETF. Short sellers far more cautious about crowded shorts.

**Regulatory mixed bag:** T+1 settled. Tick size/fee rules upheld but delayed to Nov 2026. PFOF ban not pursued. Trump SEC withdrew 14 Biden-era proposals including gamification rules.

**Key actors 5 years later:**

| Actor | Status |
|-------|--------|
| [[Citadel]] | HF returning $5B profit early 2026; Griffin's $8.1B casino approved |
| [[Citadel Securities]] | Retail boom beneficiary |
| [[Melvin Capital]] | Closed 2022; Plotkin bought Charlotte Hornets (2023) |
| Ryan Cohen | GME CEO; just bought 500K more shares |

## Pharma patent cliffs: AbbVie template, Merck and BMY next (Barron's, Jan 23)

[[AbbVie]] navigated the Humira patent cliff and returned **460%** over the decade (100+ pts above market). Forward P/E expanded from 11x to 21x. Now [[Merck]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] face similar cliffs at similar valuations.

| Company | Key drug | Cliff | Revenue at risk | Valuation | Defense |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| [[AbbVie]] | Humira | Dec 2016 (completed) | $21.2B peak | Was 11x → now 21x | Patent thicket + biologic complexity → 8yr delay |
| [[Merck]] | Keytruda | Dec 2028 | $31.7B (49%) | 11x 2027E | Thicket + Qlex subQ + 80 Phase 3 trials |
| [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] | Multiple | 2026-2031 | >75% of sales | <9x | Volume (10+ launches by 2030) |

**AbbVie's lesson:** Composition of matter patent expired Dec 2016, but patent thicket + biologic manufacturing complexity meant biosimilar competition didn't arrive until 2024. Surplus cash funded Skyrizi/Rinvoq ($31B 2026E, $50B by 2030). Only 20% of patients moved to biosimilars.

**Merck bull case:** Keytruda Qlex (subcutaneous, newer patents) delays erosion. 80 Phase 3 trials → $70B+ revenue opportunity by mid-2030s (2x Keytruda 2028E). Gardasil struggling in China (downturn + domestic alternatives).

**BMY:** Steepest cliff in Big Pharma but cheapest valuation. BofA upgraded to Buy (Dec 2025). Trough EPS ~$5 (11x trough). 4.6% yield while waiting.

See [[Patent cliffs]] for the analytical framework.

## European space: catching up with SpaceX (Bloomberg, Jan 23)

Europe's space industry entering 2026 with renewed determination after losing independent launch access in 2023 (Ariane 5 retired, Vega-C grounded). ESA approved record **€22B** over 3 years including **€900M** European Launcher Challenge for 5 startups.

**[[Isar Aerospace]]** (Munich) is the most advanced European challenger:
- 400+ employees, €500M+ raised (last: €150M from Eldridge/Boehly, Jun 2025)
- Spectrum rocket: first launch failed (~30s flight, 2025), retry planned 2026
- Building 40,000 sqm factory for 30+ rockets/year
- Chairman Bulent Altan (ex-SpaceX), CEO Daniel Metzler (33, Austrian)

**Scale gap:** Europe: 7 orbital launches in 2025. SpaceX: 130+ (Falcon 9 every couple days). Ariane 6 targeting 10/yr by 2027.

**[[Germany]] space-defense:** €35B investment by 2030. Bundeswehr wants own satellite constellation. Two of five ESA Launcher Challenge winners are German (Isar, Rocket Factory Augsburg).

**Incumbents recovering:** Ariane 6 flew 2024 (€4.7B cost, not reusable). First Amazon Kuiper launch early 2026. Vega-C (Avio) resumed flights.

**Geo-return headwind:** ESA contracts allocated by country funding share, not capability — fragments manufacturing across 13 nations.

**Comps:** Rocket Lab (RKLB, $45B mkt cap) — 75+ successful small-launcher missions since 2018, now building Neutron medium-lift. SpaceX valued ~$800B.

## Hedge fund industry: best year since GFC, but pod shops converging (Bloomberg, Jan 23)

The $5T hedge fund industry posted its best returns since the Global Financial Crisis in 2025, lifted by equity rallies and Trump tariff volatility. But the structural story is more nuanced:

| Data point | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Industry AUM | **$5T** (Preqin, Jun 2025) |
| Net inflows (2020-2025) | **Near zero** — all growth from performance |
| New fund launches | Contracting **4 consecutive years** |
| PE AUM | ~$7T (larger, grew faster) |
| Private credit AUM | ~$2T (fastest relative growth from ~$0 in 2010) |
| Goldman most-shorted basket | **+18% YTD** (short squeeze risk) |

**Pod shop convergence:** [[Citadel]] Wellington (+10.2%) and [[Millennium]] (+10.5%) converged toward industry average (~8%) in 2025 — the gap that justified premium fees shrank to ~2pp. Bloomberg calls this a potential "breaking point."

**Boutique revival:** Several $1B+ fund debuts in Jan 2026 (stock-picking, credit derivatives). Long-biased conviction plays also validated — TCI broke Citadel's 2022 profit record with aerospace bets.

**Private credit stumbles:** "Cockroach" concerns (distressed companies in portfolios) and regulatory scrutiny. PE struggling with exits. Creates opening for hedge funds if they can differentiate.

See [[Hedge fund capital concentration]] for the full structural analysis.

## India real estate: construction crisis brewing (Bloomberg Opinion, Jan 23)

[[India]]'s BSE Realty Index down **>30%** from June 2024 peak. Oberoi Realty earnings miss triggered sector-wide selloff.

**The problem isn't demand — it's execution.** Completions as % of marketable supply fell from 74% (FY17) to 57% (Q1 FY26). Builders buying land and launching projects at elevated prices post-pandemic, but failing to deliver.

| Constraint | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Delhi pollution | Construction bans during hazardous air |
| Mumbai clearances | Environmental approvals bottleneck |
| Labor shortage | Skilled workers earning more in gig economy |
| Demand narrowing | Only $1M+ homes sustaining market |

**Pre-sales model under question:** If completions keep falling, buyer confidence in weaker builders could crack. Not yet at China Vanke crisis level ($19B presold pending delivery), but fear has arrived.

## Davos AI commentary — key quotes (Jan 20-23)

Beyond [[David Sacks]] / [[Michael Kratsios]] panel (above), other leaders at WEF:

| Speaker | Key claim |
|---------|-----------|
| Elon Musk | AI smarter than any human "by end of this year, no later than next year" |
| Dario Amodei ([[Anthropic]]) | Not selling chips to China is "one of the biggest things we can do" — H200 sales have "grave" consequences for US lead |
| Jensen Huang ([[NVIDIA]]) | Europe should "leapfrog" software era, "get in early now" to fuse manufacturing + AI infra |
| Satya Nadella ([[Microsoft]]) | AI deployment will be unevenly distributed — constrained by capital + infrastructure |

**2026 framing:** Shift from hype to ROI. From brute-force scaling to new architectures. From flashy demos to targeted deployments. From promised autonomy to actual augmentation.

**OpenAI consumer device:** First-ever hardware product planned for H2 2026 (Chris Lehane, Axios House Davos).

## China: tariff cuts + AI IPO surge

**Tariff strategy (effective Jan 1, 2026):** Reduced import duties on 935 items below MFN rates. Targeted opening for industrial self-reliance inputs, not broad liberalization. Unilateral tariff reductions while the rest of the world raises barriers.

**AI IPO wave:**

| Company | Event | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Shanghai Biren Technology | HK IPO | **+120%** on debut, raised $717M — AI chip designer |
| Baidu AI chip unit | Filed confidentially | HK listing |
| MiniMax Group | Expected soon | AI startup |
| Zhipu AI | Expected soon | AI startup |

**Broad context:** Open-source AI models gaining global traction. Meta reportedly using Alibaba's Qwen model in training for new model (code-named "Avocado"). Chinese firms' embrace of open source earning goodwill despite geopolitical antagonism.

**Credit card decline:** ~100M fewer credit cards since Sep 2022 — reflects ongoing consumer confidence challenges despite policy pivot to consumption.

## Japan: stimulus + nuclear restart + trade probe

**¥1.23T ($8B+) AI & semiconductor stimulus** under PM Takaichi:
- Prioritizes [[Rapidus]] 2nm chip development
- Domestic AI development
- Supply chain resilience

**TEPCO Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 restart:** First reactor at world's largest nuclear complex (7 units, 8.2 GW). Before 2011, nuclear was ~30% of Japan's electricity. Significant for [[Power constraints]] and Japan's energy security.

**China anti-dumping probe:** Investigation into Japanese dichlorosilane imports (key semiconductor manufacturing chemical). Japan = 72% of China's domestic supply. Probe covers Jul 2024 - Jun 2025. Potential retaliation tool in tech war.

**Packaging pivot:** Japanese firms pivoting to advanced packaging as alternative strategy — can't match TSMC on lithography scale, but Japan's materials/equipment strengths extend naturally to packaging.

## Korea: Section 232 tariff concerns

[[SK Hynix]] and [[Samsung]] face scrutiny from US 25% tariff on advanced chips re-exported to China. Tariff covers processors relying on HBM supplied by Korean firms.

South Korea's trade ministry launched consultations with industry leaders and US counterparts to:
- Assess tariff impact on Korean semiconductor industry
- Ensure equal treatment for Korean firms
- Monitor effects on Samsung/SK Hynix HBM sales

Equipment spending: South Korea on track to overtake Taiwan and regain #2 globally (behind China) in semiconductor equipment investment in 2026.
