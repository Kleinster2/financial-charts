## How we got here

**The dealmaker:** [[Richard Baker]], a real estate investor, built Saks through acquisitions — betting department stores' real estate was worth more than their stock prices. He acquired Saks Fifth Avenue (2013), took HBC private (2020), then made his biggest bet.

**The fatal merger:** In late 2024, Baker orchestrated Saks's $2.7B acquisition of [[Neiman Marcus]], creating "Saks Global." The thesis: consolidate luxury department stores to survive an industry in structural decline. [[Amazon]] invested $475M for a minority stake, lending credibility.

**The debt trap:** The deal loaded $5B in obligations:
- $2.2B new junk bonds to fund the acquisition
- ~$2.8B legacy debt Neiman carried from its 2013 LBO and [[Neiman Marcus bankruptcy 2020|2020 bankruptcy]]
- Interest costs jumped from $234M to ~$400M annually (+70%)

**Why it failed:**
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly enough to offset interest burden
- Rising rates made the debt more expensive
- Luxury sales softened in 2025
- Vendors, seeing distress, pulled back shipments → inventory gaps → lost sales

## Debt timeline

| Date | Event | Amount | Detail |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Nov 2014** | [[Ground lease]] mortgage | $1.25B | 20-year, interest-only on [[611 Fifth Avenue]] ground |
| **Mar 2020** | HBC privatization | $1.1B | Baker took company private at $11/share |
| **Aug 2024** | Flagship refinancing | $600M | Used [[611 Fifth Avenue]] as collateral — **without [[Amazon]] consent** |
| **Dec 2024** | Neiman acquisition bonds | $2.2B | 11% senior secured notes, due 2029 |
| **Aug 2025** | Debt exchange | $600M | Bondholders swapped $2.2B bonds for lower principal; provided $300M new loan |
| **Dec 2025** | Missed interest payment | $100M | Triggered default |
| **Jan 2026** | Chapter 11 / [[DIP financing]] | $1.75B | Flagship pledged as collateral |

**The August 2025 exchange:** With bonds trading at ~30 cents on dollar, Saks convinced 98% of bondholders to swap their $2.2B in 11% notes for securities with **lower principal** in exchange for $200M new financing. This bought 5 months — not enough.

### Bond tranches

The August 2025 debt exchange converted the original $2.2B bonds into a tiered structure:

| Tranche | Amount | Issued | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| **SPV Notes (SGUS)** | ~$762M | Jun/Aug 2025 | Senior |
| **2O Notes (Second Out)** | ~$1.4B | Aug 2025 exchange | Second |
| **3O Notes (Third Out)** | ~$441M | Aug 2025 exchange | Third |
| **Old Notes (not exchanged)** | ~$51M | Dec 2024 (Neiman deal) | Junior to 2O/3O |

**Total bond debt:** ~$2.65B

Bondholders who participated in the exchange traded face value for seniority — getting a mix of SPV, 2O, and 3O notes.

### Bond price collapse

![[attachments/saks-bond-prices-collapse-2025-2026.png]]

| Tranche | Jul 2025 | Nov 2025 | Jan 2026 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **SGUS** (senior) | ~95 cents | ~95 cents | ~25 cents |
| **2O Notes** | ~35 cents | ~40 cents | <5 cents |
| **3O Notes** | ~25 cents | ~25 cents | <5 cents |

The gray zone marks November 2025 — when the death spiral accelerated. Bondholders who bought at 40 cents months earlier now face recoveries of less than a penny.

## The vicious cycle

```
Couldn't pay vendors
    → Vendors stopped shipping
        → No inventory
            → No sales
                → Couldn't pay vendors
```

**Mark Weinsten (CRO, court filing):** [[Saks-Neiman merger]] led to "immediate liquidity challenges" and "unsustainable" capital structure.

## Amazon's loss

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | $475M equity ([[Saks-Neiman merger]]) |
| Current value | "Presumptively worthless" |
| Platform | "Saks on Amazon" (never launched) |
| Commercial agreement | $900M guaranteed over 8 years |
| Amazon's claim | Saks **breached** agreement to sell on Amazon platform |
| Response | Demanding examiner or trustee |

Amazon claimed Saks breached their agreement to sell products on Amazon's platform — the deal included launching "Saks on Amazon" and guaranteed at least $900M in payments over 8 years. Now cancelled.

## The flagship fight

The $3.6 billion Fifth Avenue flagship became the central battleground of the bankruptcy.

### The asset

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Property | 611 Fifth Ave, Manhattan |
| 2024 appraisal | **$3.6B** |
| 2014 appraisal | $3.7B |
| 2019 appraisal | $1.6B |
| 2013 HBC acquisition | $2.9B (entire Saks chain) |

The flagship alone is now worth **more than HBC paid for all of Saks** in 2013. In 2014, Baker took out a $1.25B, 20-year mortgage on the ground beneath the store, calling it "potentially the single most valuable retail building in the world."

### Amazon's consent rights

When Amazon invested $475M in 2024, the LLC agreement gave them **consent rights over new financing**. Amazon explicitly stated: "does not consent to any financing that encumbers HoldCo II or Flagship."

**The corporate structure:**
```
Saks Global Holdings LLC (parent debtor)
    └── Saks Fifth Avenue HoldCo LLC ("HoldCo II") ← Amazon invested here
            └── Saks Flagship Real Property LLC ("Flagship PropCo")
                    └── Owns 611 Fifth Avenue
```

Amazon invested at HoldCo II, which wholly owns the flagship. But HoldCo II is **member-managed with no independent directors** — decisions roll up to Saks management. Amazon argued HoldCo II had "no material expenses" and didn't need the DIP, and offered separate financing. Rejected.

**August 2024 refinancing:** Saks raised $600M from bondholders using the flagship as collateral — **without Amazon's consent**. Amazon objected but was overruled.

### The DIP collateral dispute

When Saks needed $1.75B DIP financing to survive Chapter 11, they pledged the flagship as collateral. This **subordinated Amazon behind bondholders** in the repayment line.

**Amazon's argument:** The flagship value was already pledged to guarantee Amazon's interests under the LLC agreement. Using it for DIP financing "would violate Amazon's consent rights" and "inflict significant harm."

**Saks's argument:** Without ability to borrow against the flagship, there would be no DIP financing — liquidation was the only alternative.

**Amazon's counterproposal:** Immediate liquidation of the flagship would be "more beneficial" to creditors than the DIP structure.

### The ruling

**Judge Alfredo Perez** (Houston bankruptcy court) approved **initial $400M** in cash access after a 7.5-hour marathon hearing on Jan 15, 2026. Key reasoning: the money would give Saks a chance to stabilize and restructure; without it, liquidation was imminent.

**Next step:** Saks must return to court in coming weeks for **final approval** of the full $1.75B financing package.

**CRO Mark Weinstein:** Saks would be "dead in the water" without the financing. The company had $30-35M in bills due that day alone.

**What it reveals:** In luxury retail, real estate — not digital scale or brand equity — remains the ultimate leverage. Amazon's $475M tech/partnership bet was wiped out, while the 1924 limestone building retained its value.

## Restructuring

**New leadership (Jan 14):**

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| CEO | Geoffroy van Raemdonck | Ex-[[Neiman Marcus]] CEO |
| President/CCO | Darcy Penick | Ex-Bergdorf president |

[[Richard Baker]] replaced as CEO.

**Financing:**

| Type | Amount |
|------|--------|
| DIP (operations) | $1B |
| Exit financing | $500M |
| **Total** | **$1.75B** |

**Potential outcomes:**
- Creditors swap debt for equity
- Bergdorf Goodman sale (attracting buyers)
- Store closures in mid-size cities
- Amazon equity wiped

**Meeting of Creditors:** Feb 23, 2026

## Why it matters

**For luxury retail:**
- Validates [[Department store decline]] thesis
- Luxury not immune to structural pressure

**For credit markets:**
- Another failed LBO/debt-fueled M&A
- Private credit exposure ($4.2B secured claims)

**For Amazon:**
- Rare strategic investment loss
- Questions about retail M&A judgment
