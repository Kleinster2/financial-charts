## How we got here

**The dealmaker:** [[Richard Baker]], a real estate investor, built Saks through acquisitions — betting department stores' real estate was worth more than their stock prices. He acquired Saks Fifth Avenue (2013), took HBC private (2020), then made his biggest bet.

**The fatal merger:** In late 2024, Baker orchestrated Saks's $2.7B acquisition of [[Neiman Marcus]], creating "Saks Global." The thesis: consolidate luxury department stores to survive an industry in structural decline. [[Amazon]] invested $475M for a minority stake, lending credibility.

**The debt trap:** The deal loaded $5B in obligations:
- $2.2B new junk bonds to fund the acquisition
- ~$2.8B legacy debt Neiman carried from its 2013 LBO and [[Neiman Marcus bankruptcy 2020|2020 bankruptcy]]
- Interest costs jumped from $234M to ~$400M annually (+70%)

**Why it failed:**
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly enough to offset interest burden
- Rising rates made the debt more expensive
- Luxury sales softened in 2025
- Vendors, seeing distress, pulled back shipments → inventory gaps → lost sales

## The vicious cycle

```
Couldn't pay vendors
    → Vendors stopped shipping
        → No inventory
            → No sales
                → Couldn't pay vendors
```

**Mark Weinsten (CRO, court filing):** [[Saks-Neiman merger]] led to "immediate liquidity challenges" and "unsustainable" capital structure.

## Why it matters

**For luxury retail:**
- Validates [[Department store decline]] thesis
- Luxury not immune to structural pressure

**For credit markets:**
- Another failed LBO/debt-fueled M&A
- Private credit exposure ($4.2B secured claims)

**For Amazon:**
- Rare strategic investment loss
- Questions about retail M&A judgment
