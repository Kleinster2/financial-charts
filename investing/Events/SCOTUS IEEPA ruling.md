SCOTUS IEEPA ruling — On February 20, 2026, the [[Supreme Court]] ruled 6-3 that the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA) does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. Struck down Trump's most sweeping trade duties. $175B+ in collected revenue at risk of refund.

## The decision

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | February 20, 2026 |
| Vote | 6-3 |
| Majority | [[John Roberts]] (author), [[Sonia Sotomayor]], [[Elena Kagan]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]], [[Ketanji Brown Jackson]] |
| Dissent | [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] |
| Core holding | IEEPA does not authorize tariffs |

Roberts wrote that "The Framers gave that power to 'Congress alone.'"

Notable: In roughly two dozen previous cases, the Court had largely supported Trump's presidential authority claims. This was a significant break — with [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] joining the liberal justices.

## What was struck down

IEEPA tariffs represented over 60% of total tariff revenue collected in 2025. Never before used to impose tariffs until Feb 2025.

| IEEPA tariff | Rate | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Reciprocal tariffs | 10% baseline, up to 145% on [[China]] | Trade deficit |
| [[Canada]] fentanyl tariff | 25% (later 35%) | Drug enforcement |
| [[Mexico]] fentanyl tariff | 25% | Drug enforcement |
| [[Iran]] secondary tariff | 25% on countries doing business with Iran | Sanctions enforcement |

---

## What survives

| Authority | Tariffs | Legal basis |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Section 232 | Steel, aluminum, autos, [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff\|semiconductors]], copper, trucks, lumber | Trade Expansion Act 1962 |
| Section 301 | China-specific product tariffs (25-100% on EVs, batteries, solar, chips) | Trade Act 1974 |
| Antidumping/CVD | Various product-specific duties | Trade Remedies Act |
| MFN duties | Standard tariff schedule | Tariff Act 1930 |

Effective tariff rate: Drops from 16.1% → 10.4% with IEEPA tariffs removed.

## Fiscal impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total IEEPA revenue collected (Feb 2025 – Feb 2026) | $175-179B (Penn-Wharton Budget Model) |
| Daily IEEPA revenue at time of ruling | ~$500M/day |
| Potential refund liability | $175B+ |
| For comparison | Exceeds combined DOT ($127.6B) + DOJ ($44.9B) FY2025 budgets |
| CBP last published figure (Dec 14) | $133.5B at-risk duties |

Per Dec 2025 lower court ruling, importers do not need to file separate lawsuits to preserve refund rights. Admin conceded refunds including interest will issue if tariffs ruled unlawful.

## Administration response

| Tool | Mechanism | Limits |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Section 232 | National security tariffs | Requires Commerce investigation (~9 months) |
| Section 301 | Unfair trade practices | Requires USTR investigation |
| Section 122 | Balance-of-payments | 15% max, 150 days |
| Section 338 | Discriminatory practices | 50% max, never used |

[[Scott Bessent]] (earlier): "What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level."

JPMorgan trading desk: 64% probability of "struck down + immediately replaced" scenario — explaining muted market reaction.

Congressional dynamic: Half a dozen Republicans voted with Democrats earlier in Feb to repeal Canada tariffs — rare bipartisan rebuke of tariff policy.

## Market reaction (Feb 20)

| Index | Move |
|-------|------|
| S&P 500 | +0.4% |
| Dow | +0.4% |
| Nasdaq | +0.6% |

Winners: Retail/apparel (hit hardest by IEEPA duties in 2025) — [[Victoria's Secret]] +5.6%, [[Dollar Tree]] +4%, [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] +5.5%, [[Nike]] rallied.

Muted upside explanation: Markets had partially priced in. JPM's 64% "immediately replaced" scenario limits sustained rally.

## Timeline

| Nov 2025 | Oral arguments at Supreme Court |
| Dec 2025 | Lower court: importers can preserve refund rights without lawsuits |
| Jan 2026 | [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]] uses non-IEEPA authority (anticipating adverse ruling) |
| Feb 20, 2026 | Supreme Court rules 6-3: IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional |

## Implications

For [[US-China tariffs]]: Reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs struck down. Section 301 tariffs (25-100% on specific products) remain. Net China tariff rate drops substantially but not to zero.

For [[Secondary sanctions]]: Iran tariff-based approach (25% on countries doing business with Iran) relied on IEEPA — now invalid. Traditional [[OFAC]] sanctions unaffected.

For [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]]: Vindicated as the legally durable path. Administration's Jan 2026 decision to use Section 232 instead of IEEPA for chip tariffs proved prescient.

For importers: $175B+ refund claims expected. [[US Customs and Border Protection]] will process. Interest applies.

For Congress: Ruling reasserts Congressional tariff authority. Future tariff policy requires legislative action or narrower statutory authorities.
