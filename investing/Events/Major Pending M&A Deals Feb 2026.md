## 1. Netflix / Warner Bros Discovery ($83B) — Paramount Competing Bid

The marquee deal of the cycle. Netflix bid $27.75/share all-cash for WBD's studios + HBO/Max assets in Dec 2025. WBD currently trades ~$27.57, implying a tight **~0.7% spread** to Netflix's offer.

**The twist: Paramount's hostile competing bid.**

Paramount Global (post-Skydance merger) launched a hostile all-cash bid of **$30/share for all of WBD** — enterprise value ~$108.4B including debt. This is for the *entire* company (not just studios/HBO like Netflix's carve-out).

Key developments:
- **Feb 10, 2026:** Paramount sweetened with a **25¢/share quarterly ticking fee** if the deal hasn't closed by Dec 31, 2026 — effectively raising the price over time
- **WBD board** told shareholders to "take no action" on the Paramount offer
- **Activist Ancora** pushing WBD board to formally engage with Paramount
- **Senate antitrust hearing** held Feb 3, 2026 — concerns about media consolidation
- **DOJ review** ongoing for both bids

**Arb dynamics:** If Paramount wins, WBD shareholders get $30/share vs current ~$27.57 = **~9% upside**. The Netflix deal at $27.75 offers only ~0.7%. The market is pricing in Netflix as the likely winner but Paramount's bid creates meaningful optionality. The ticking fee mechanism adds urgency for WBD's board to either engage or reject formally.

**Key risk:** Antitrust — both deals face DOJ scrutiny. A Paramount/WBD combination would be an enormous media conglomerate. Netflix/WBD is arguably less anticompetitive (streaming + studios vs. full horizontal merger).

## 2. Charter / Cox Communications ($34.5B)

Announced May 2025. Charter acquiring Cox to create the **largest US cable/broadband provider**.

- Subject to **FCC + DOJ antitrust review**
- Outside deadline: **May 16, 2026** (extendable to 2027)
- Charter (CHTR) trading ~$241
- Connecticut already reached settlement with consumer protection commitments

**Arb dynamics:** Defensive merger in a declining industry — both face cord-cutting headwinds, rising capex for fiber/DOCSIS 4.0, and FCC broadband competition rules. The deal logic is cost synergies and scale. Regulatory risk is moderate — cable mergers have precedent (Charter/TWC in 2016). The extended deadline provides cushion.

---

## 3. Nuveen / Schroders ($13.5B)

**Announced Feb 12, 2026.** Nuveen (TIAA subsidiary) offering £9.9B all-cash — **612p/share**, a 34% premium to undisturbed price. Schroders trading ~588p, implying a **~4% spread**.

- **Only 41% irrevocable commitments** — well below typical UK takeover thresholds
- **Largest-ever European fund manager acquisition**
- Morningstar says deal is **unlikely to end at current terms** — implying either a bump or a competing bid

**Arb dynamics:** The wide 4% spread + low irrevocables + Morningstar skepticism suggest the market expects either (a) a higher bid, (b) a competing offer, or (c) meaningful regulatory/shareholder risk. This is a live arb situation worth monitoring. UK Takeover Panel rules apply — potential for a formal auction process if a rival emerges.

---

## 4. Union Pacific / Norfolk Southern (~$85B)

Stock-and-cash deal that would create the **first coast-to-coast Class I freight railroad** in the US.

- **Massive antitrust questions** — Surface Transportation Board (STB) has historically blocked railroad mergers that reduce competition
- STB moratorium on Class I railroad mergers was lifted, but scrutiny remains extreme
- Likely **2027 close** at the earliest given regulatory complexity
- Would reduce Class I railroads from 6 to 5

**Arb dynamics:** Very wide implied spread given regulatory uncertainty. The STB review process is lengthy and unpredictable. Shipper opposition likely. This is a multi-year arb with binary regulatory risk.

---

## 5. Boston Scientific / Penumbra ($14.5B)

Cash-and-stock deal at **$374/share**. Medical device consolidation — neurovascular and cardiovascular.

- Expected **H2 2026 close**
- FTC review standard for medtech
- Strategically logical — BSX expanding interventional portfolio

---

## 6. Hg Capital / OneStream ($6.4B)

Take-private, all-cash. PE firm Hg buying enterprise software company OneStream **less than 2 years after its IPO**.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Straightforward PE take-private — limited regulatory risk
- Reflects PE appetite for enterprise software at reasonable multiples post-2024 correction

---

## 7. SoftBank / DigitalBridge ($4B)

SoftBank acquiring DigitalBridge's digital infrastructure platform. **AI infrastructure play** — data centers, fiber, towers.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Fits SoftBank's AI thesis under Masayoshi Son

---

## 8. Eli Lilly / Ventyx Biosciences ($1.2B)

All-cash acquisition. Lilly acquiring Ventyx's **NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor** pipeline.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Pharma bolt-on — low regulatory risk
- Strategic fit with Lilly's immunology ambitions

---

## 9. Pharma Bolt-Ons

- **Sanofi / Dynavax** — vaccine adjuvant technology
- **GSK / RAPT Therapeutics** — immunology pipeline

Both standard pharma acquisitions with minimal deal risk.

---

## 10. Other Pending Deals

- **PIF + Silver Lake + Affinity Partners / Electronic Arts** — Consortium take-private of EA. Details pending.
- **SoftBank / ABB Robotics** — SoftBank acquiring ABB's robotics division. Fits AI/automation thesis.
