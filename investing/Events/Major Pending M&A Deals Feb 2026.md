## 1. Paramount / Warner Bros Discovery ($31/share) — RESOLVED

Bidding war resolved Feb 26, 2026. WBD board declared [[Paramount Global]]'s $31/share all-cash bid a "Superior Proposal." [[Netflix]] declined to match its $27.75/share offer and collected a $2.8B breakup fee.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Winning bid | [[Paramount Global]] — $31/share all-cash for entire company |
| Enterprise value | ~$77B |
| Netflix bid (withdrawn) | $27.75/share for studios + HBO only (~$83B) |
| Netflix breakup fee | $2.8B |
| Shareholder vote | March 20, 2026 |
| Financial backstop | [[Larry Ellison]] $40B personal equity guarantee |

Key timeline:
- Dec 5, 2025: Netflix bid announced
- Feb 10: Paramount sweetened to $30 + ticking fee
- Feb 20: Paramount cleared HSR second request
- Feb 23: Paramount submitted $31 "best and final"
- Feb 26: WBD board declared Superior Proposal; Netflix walked away

Remaining risk: shareholder vote (March 20), Paramount financing complexity, integration of entire WBD (including [[Linear TV]] assets Netflix didn't want).

## 2. Charter / Cox Communications ($34.5B)

Announced May 2025. Charter acquiring Cox to create the **largest US cable/broadband provider**.

- Subject to **FCC + DOJ antitrust review**
- Outside deadline: **May 16, 2026** (extendable to 2027)
- Charter (CHTR) trading ~$241
- Connecticut already reached settlement with consumer protection commitments

**Arb dynamics:** Defensive merger in a declining industry — both face cord-cutting headwinds, rising capex for fiber/DOCSIS 4.0, and FCC broadband competition rules. The deal logic is cost synergies and scale. Regulatory risk is moderate — cable mergers have precedent (Charter/TWC in 2016). The extended deadline provides cushion.

---

## 3. Nuveen / Schroders ($13.5B)

**Announced Feb 12, 2026.** Nuveen (TIAA subsidiary) offering £9.9B all-cash — **612p/share**, a 34% premium to undisturbed price. Schroders trading ~588p, implying a **~4% spread**.

- **Only 41% irrevocable commitments** — well below typical UK takeover thresholds
- **Largest-ever European fund manager acquisition**
- Morningstar says deal is **unlikely to end at current terms** — implying either a bump or a competing bid

**Arb dynamics:** The wide 4% spread + low irrevocables + Morningstar skepticism suggest the market expects either (a) a higher bid, (b) a competing offer, or (c) meaningful regulatory/shareholder risk. This is a live arb situation worth monitoring. UK Takeover Panel rules apply — potential for a formal auction process if a rival emerges.

---

## 4. Union Pacific / Norfolk Southern (~$85B)

Stock-and-cash deal that would create the **first coast-to-coast Class I freight railroad** in the US.

- **Massive antitrust questions** — Surface Transportation Board (STB) has historically blocked railroad mergers that reduce competition
- STB moratorium on Class I railroad mergers was lifted, but scrutiny remains extreme
- Likely **2027 close** at the earliest given regulatory complexity
- Would reduce Class I railroads from 6 to 5

**Arb dynamics:** Very wide implied spread given regulatory uncertainty. The STB review process is lengthy and unpredictable. Shipper opposition likely. This is a multi-year arb with binary regulatory risk.

---

## 5. Boston Scientific / Penumbra ($14.5B)

Cash-and-stock deal at **$374/share**. Medical device consolidation — neurovascular and cardiovascular.

- Expected **H2 2026 close**
- FTC review standard for medtech
- Strategically logical — BSX expanding interventional portfolio

---

## 6. Hg Capital / OneStream ($6.4B)

Take-private, all-cash. PE firm Hg buying enterprise software company OneStream **less than 2 years after its IPO**.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Straightforward PE take-private — limited regulatory risk
- Reflects PE appetite for enterprise software at reasonable multiples post-2024 correction

---

## 7. SoftBank / DigitalBridge ($4B)

SoftBank acquiring DigitalBridge's digital infrastructure platform. **AI infrastructure play** — data centers, fiber, towers.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Fits SoftBank's AI thesis under Masayoshi Son

---

## 8. Eli Lilly / Ventyx Biosciences ($1.2B)

All-cash acquisition. Lilly acquiring Ventyx's **NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor** pipeline.

- Expected **H1 2026 close**
- Pharma bolt-on — low regulatory risk
- Strategic fit with Lilly's immunology ambitions

---

## 9. Pharma Bolt-Ons

- **Sanofi / Dynavax** — vaccine adjuvant technology
- **GSK / RAPT Therapeutics** — immunology pipeline

Both standard pharma acquisitions with minimal deal risk.

---

## 10. Other Pending Deals

- **PIF + Silver Lake + Affinity Partners / Electronic Arts** — Consortium take-private of EA. Details pending.
- **SoftBank / ABB Robotics** — SoftBank acquiring ABB's robotics division. Fits AI/automation thesis.
