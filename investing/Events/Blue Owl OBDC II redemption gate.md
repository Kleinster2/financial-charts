**Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate** — On February 19, 2026, [[Blue Owl]] permanently halted quarterly redemptions at its retail-focused private credit fund OBDC II after selling $1.4B in loans. First major retail BDC to gate investors. Triggered a sector-wide selloff in alternative asset managers and raised systemic questions about the $1.8 trillion [[Private credit]] market's retail push.

*First instance of the [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]].*

## What happened

[[Blue Owl]] sold **$1.4 billion in loans** from three BDC funds to four North American pension and insurance investors:

| Fund | Amount sold | % of portfolio | Action |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **OBDC II** | $600M | 34% of $1.7B | **Permanently halted quarterly redemptions** |
| OBDC | $400M | 2% of portfolio | Normal operations continue |
| OTIC | $400M | 6% of portfolio | Normal operations continue |

- Loans sold at **99.7% of par** — no distress pricing
- **Buyers identified** (Bloomberg, Feb 20): [[CalPERS]], [[OMERS]], [[British Columbia Investment Management]], and [[Kuvare]] (Blue Owl's own insurer, acquired $750M in 2024)
- 97% senior secured, 128 portfolio companies, 27 industries
- Largest sector: **internet software & services at 13%**
- OBDC II investors receive up to **$2.35/share (~30% of NAV)** by end of March
- Future distributions via pro-rata quarterly payouts from earnings, repayments, and asset sales

---

## Causal chain

Five layers of pressure converged:

### 1. Credit quality deterioration
- Middle-market borrower defaults climbed to **4.55%**
- Downgrades outpacing upgrades for **7 consecutive quarters**
- High interest rates squeezing floating-rate borrowers — the very companies OBDC II lent to

### 2. Software valuation collapse
- S&P 500 Software & Services index lost **~$2 trillion** since October peak
- ~Half the losses came in February 2026 alone, driven by [[AI agents]] disruption fears
- [[SaaS stock meltdown 2026]] destroyed confidence in software cash flows
- 13% of OBDC II's portfolio was internet software — the most exposed sector

### 3. Redemption surge
- ~$150M in redemption requests in first 9 months of 2025, **up 20% YoY**
- Retail investors — promised semi-liquid access — wanted out as AI fears mounted
- Continued acceleration into early 2026

### 4. Botched merger destroyed trust
- Late 2025: Blue Owl tried to merge OBDC II into publicly-traded OBDC
- Would have imposed **~20% losses** on OBDC II investors due to trading price of public vehicle
- Abandoned after stock selloff and investor backlash
- Redemptions frozen during merger negotiations
- Investors expected redemptions to resume Q1 2026 — instead got permanent halt
- After merger failed, Blue Owl pivoted to loan sales as the exit path

### 5. Structural liquidity mismatch
- Retail investors were sold quarterly 5% NAV redemption windows
- Underlying assets: middle-market loans that can't be sold quickly without losses
- Honoring all redemptions would benefit early redeemers at remaining investors' expense
- Blue Owl chose to gate everyone equally — the "prisoner's dilemma" resolution

## Key voices

**Mohamed El-Erian (X post, Feb 19):** *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?"* Said private credit boom may have gone "too far overall." Warned of a "market for lemons" problem — weaker assets indistinguishable from stronger ones during stress. Called valuation adjustments the "elephant in the room" — *"a significant and necessary valuation hit"* looming. Clarified "nowhere near" 2008 scale. NYT: redemption change "reminded him of the beginnings of the financial crisis."

**Craig Packer (Blue Owl co-President):** *"We aren't halting redemptions... We've been tendering for 5% of the shares of this fund for eight years. Instead of resuming 5% a quarter, we are in fact accelerating redemptions. And we're going to return to this investor group 30% of their capital at book value in the next 45 days."* Sold $1.4B at near-par — called it *"strong for any asset class to clear that kind of size at that kind of price."*

**Michael Covello (Robert A Stanger & Co.):** Called it a *"favorable outcome"* — 30% distribution at book value better than the ~20% loss investors faced from the terminated merger.

**Barclays:** Called the loan sale *"a strong step toward winding down the fund."*

**Sen. Elizabeth Warren:** Called for increased bank capital requirements for private credit exposures, greater data disclosure, and a stress test. *"The Trump administration needs to wake up. Stop pushing these risky investments into Americans' retirement accounts."*

**Blue Owl spokesperson:** *"Contrary to what has been reported by some, we are not halting investor liquidity."*

**Dan Rasmussen (Verdad Capital, Feb 20):** *"This is a canary in the coal mine. The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst."* Called it *"classic fool's yield"* — high yield that doesn't translate to returns because borrowers were too risky.

**Guy LeBas (Janney Montgomery Scott):** *"The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans... Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds."*

**Duke University Fuqua School of Business (Sept 2025 research):** Institutional BDC ownership has steadily declined to **~25% by 2023** — retail investors are now the dominant equity capital source for publicly traded BDCs.

**247 Wall Street analysis:** Pushes back on crisis narrative — OBDC II delivered **80% cumulative returns (9.3% annualized)** since inception, non-accruals under 2%, realized losses only 23 bps. This is a finite-life fund approaching its natural end date, not a blowup.

## Why it matters — systemic significance

### The private credit retail problem

The industry spent 2020-2025 aggressively pushing semi-liquid private credit vehicles to retail and HNW investors — a **$80 trillion capital pool** that PE firms covet. The pitch: bond-like yields (8-12%) with quarterly liquidity. The reality: illiquid loans to middle-market companies that can't be sold without losses when everyone wants out at once.

OBDC II is the **first major test** of this model under stress. At $1.7B, it's small. But the template is what matters:

| Vehicle | AUM | Manager | Risk |
|---------|-----|---------|------|
| OBDC II | $1.7B | [[Blue Owl]] | **Gated** |
| OBDC | $16B+ | [[Blue Owl]] | Watching |
| ARCC | $26B+ | [[Ares Management]] | Largest BDC |
| Blackstone Private Credit | $50B+ | [[Blackstone]] | Largest private |
| Apollo private credit retail | Various | [[Apollo]] | Growing fast |

Industry-wide: BDCs with >$1B AUM saw **$2.9B in withdrawal requests in Q4 2025**, up **200% from Q3** (Robert A Stanger & Co.). The exodus is already underway.

If redemption pressure spreads to these larger vehicles, the $1.8T private credit market faces a real liquidity event.

### The BDC → CLO leverage escalation (Barclays, Feb 20)

[[Barclays]] warned the loan sale could become a **template** for shifting debt from BDCs into more opaque, more highly leveraged vehicles. Some sold assets likely end up in Blue Owl-managed [[CLO]]s — purchased by [[Kuvare]], Blue Owl's own insurance firm ($750M acquisition, 2024).

| Structure | Typical leverage | Transparency |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| BDC | ~1x equity | Public filings, quarterly reports |
| CLO | **9-10x** | Opaque, limited disclosure |

Barclays: "If similar transactions are repeated frequently, it would deepen the ties between these two parts of the non-bank sector, which could make it more difficult to track the risk." CLOs are attractive to insurers like Kuvare because of high ratings and beneficial capital treatment — but they add **an order of magnitude more leverage** to the same private credit assets. See [[PE-insurance convergence]].

### The [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] link

This isn't just a liquidity story — it's a **credit quality story**. 13% of sold loans were internet software. The [[SaaS stock meltdown 2026]] is flowing through to private credit via:

1. Software company valuations collapse → equity cushion erodes
2. PE sponsors less willing to inject equity to support portfolio companies
3. Floating-rate debt squeezes borrowers already facing AI-driven revenue headwinds
4. Defaults rise → BDC NAVs decline → retail investors redeem → forced sales → more defaults

This is the feedback loop the market is pricing in.

### August 2007 parallel (El-Erian)

| 2007 | 2026 |
|------|------|
| Bear Stearns hedge funds gated | Blue Owl OBDC II gated |
| Subprime mortgage concentration | Software/tech loan concentration |
| CDOs with liquidity mismatch | Retail BDCs with liquidity mismatch |
| "Contained" narrative | "Finite-life wind-down" narrative |
| $10T mortgage market | $1.8T private credit market |

**Key difference:** Private credit ($1.8T) is much smaller than the 2007 mortgage market ($10T+) and better capitalized. But the pattern — opaque, concentrated, levered, with retail money in illiquid structures — rhymes.

## OBDC Q4 2025 earnings (same day)

Blue Owl reported OBDC earnings the same morning as the gate news — the numbers undercut the crisis narrative:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Non-accruals (fair value) | **1.1%** | Down from 1.3% (Q3), below public defaults |
| Software revenue growth (LTM) | **+10%** | Performing |
| Software EBITDA growth (LTM) | **+16%** | Performing |
| Software first-lien secured | **90%** | LTVs ~30% |
| Total portfolio revenue growth | **+8% YoY** | Positive every sub-sector |
| Total portfolio EBITDA growth | **+11% YoY** | Accelerating vs 2024 |
| PIK % of investment income | **10.3%** | Down from 13.2% YoY |
| Interest coverage | **~2x** | Healthy |
| NAV/share | **$14.81** | Down $0.08 on watch-list write-downs |

CEO Packer called the "halted redemptions" framing a *"complete mischaracterization."* Software is only 4 of top 25 investments. **Moody's upgraded OBDC to Baa2** in January — one of few BDCs earning that rating.

**No specific borrower defaults named.** The gate happened at non-accruals of just 1.1% — this is a **liquidity/structure crisis, not a credit blowup**. The market is pricing forward-looking AI disruption risk before defaults materialize. If non-accruals spike to 4-5% (Deutsche Bank's aggressive scenario), the impact would be far worse from an already-gated position.

## Bear vs bull

**Bear case (canary in the coalmine):**
- First retail BDC gate → template for larger funds
- Software concentration risk just starting to manifest
- 7 quarters of downgrades with no reversal
- El-Erian's August 2007 comparison has historical precedent
- Alt manager stocks already pricing in contagion

**Bull case (controlled wind-down):**
- Finite-life fund approaching natural 2027 end date
- Sold at 99.7% of par — no fire sale
- 80% cumulative returns, 9.3% annualized — strong track record
- Non-accruals under 2%, realized losses 23 bps
- Pro-rata distribution is fairer than first-come-first-served redemptions
- Larger funds (OBDC, ARCC) show no similar stress

---

## What to watch

- **OBDC redemption requests** — Blue Owl's $16B+ publicly-traded BDC. Any spike = escalation
- **Ares ARCC quarterly report** — largest BDC ($26B+), canary for broader market
- **Blackstone BCRED** — largest non-traded private credit fund. Any redemption pressure = systemic
- **Software default rates** — currently 4.55% for middle-market. Deutsche Bank models 13% under aggressive AI scenario
- **PIK loan growth** — payment-in-kind = borrowers can't service cash interest. Software is #1 PIK sector
- **March 31 quarter-end** — next redemption window for most semi-liquid funds
