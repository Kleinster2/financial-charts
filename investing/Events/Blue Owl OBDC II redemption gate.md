**Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate** — On February 19, 2026, [[Blue Owl]] permanently halted quarterly redemptions at its retail-focused private credit fund OBDC II after selling $1.4B in loans. First major retail BDC to gate investors. Triggered a sector-wide selloff in alternative asset managers and raised systemic questions about the $1.8 trillion [[Private credit]] market's retail push.

## What happened

[[Blue Owl]] sold **$1.4 billion in loans** from three BDC funds to four North American pension and insurance investors:

| Fund | Amount sold | % of portfolio | Action |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **OBDC II** | $600M | 34% of $1.7B | **Permanently halted quarterly redemptions** |
| OBDC | $400M | 2% of portfolio | Normal operations continue |
| OTIC | $400M | 6% of portfolio | Normal operations continue |

- Loans sold at **99.7% of par** — no distress pricing
- 97% senior secured, 128 portfolio companies, 27 industries
- Largest sector: **internet software & services at 13%**
- OBDC II investors receive up to **$2.35/share (~30% of NAV)** by end of March
- Future distributions via pro-rata quarterly payouts from earnings, repayments, and asset sales

---

## Causal chain

Five layers of pressure converged:

### 1. Credit quality deterioration
- Middle-market borrower defaults climbed to **4.55%**
- Downgrades outpacing upgrades for **7 consecutive quarters**
- High interest rates squeezing floating-rate borrowers — the very companies OBDC II lent to

### 2. Software valuation collapse
- S&P 500 Software & Services index lost **~$2 trillion** since October peak
- ~Half the losses came in February 2026 alone, driven by [[AI agents]] disruption fears
- [[SaaS stock meltdown 2026]] destroyed confidence in software cash flows
- 13% of OBDC II's portfolio was internet software — the most exposed sector

### 3. Redemption surge
- ~$150M in redemption requests in first 9 months of 2025, **up 20% YoY**
- Retail investors — promised semi-liquid access — wanted out as AI fears mounted
- Continued acceleration into early 2026

### 4. Botched merger destroyed trust
- Nov 2025: Blue Owl tried to merge OBDC II into larger, publicly-traded OBDC
- Would have imposed **~20% losses** on OBDC II investors
- Abandoned after stock selloff and investor backlash
- Redemptions frozen during merger negotiations
- Investors expected redemptions to resume Q1 2026 — instead got permanent halt

### 5. Structural liquidity mismatch
- Retail investors were sold quarterly 5% NAV redemption windows
- Underlying assets: middle-market loans that can't be sold quickly without losses
- Honoring all redemptions would benefit early redeemers at remaining investors' expense
- Blue Owl chose to gate everyone equally — the "prisoner's dilemma" resolution

## Key voices

**Mohamed El-Erian:** *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007? The question will be on the minds of some investors and policymakers this morning."* Said it raises questions about systemic risks and *"a significant — and necessary — valuation hit is looming for specific assets."*

**Craig Packer (Blue Owl co-President):** Framed the halt as orderly wind-down, not a crisis. Hopes to return capital "quickly" to OBDC II investors.

**247 Wall Street analysis:** Pushes back on crisis narrative — OBDC II delivered **80% cumulative returns (9.3% annualized)** since inception, non-accruals under 2%, realized losses only 23 bps. This is a finite-life fund approaching its natural end date, not a blowup.

## Why it matters — systemic significance

### The private credit retail problem

The industry spent 2020-2025 aggressively pushing semi-liquid private credit vehicles to retail and HNW investors — a **$80 trillion capital pool** that PE firms covet. The pitch: bond-like yields (8-12%) with quarterly liquidity. The reality: illiquid loans to middle-market companies that can't be sold without losses when everyone wants out at once.

OBDC II is the **first major test** of this model under stress. At $1.7B, it's small. But the template is what matters:

| Vehicle | AUM | Manager | Risk |
|---------|-----|---------|------|
| OBDC II | $1.7B | [[Blue Owl]] | **Gated** |
| OBDC | $16B+ | [[Blue Owl]] | Watching |
| ARCC | $26B+ | [[Ares Management]] | Largest BDC |
| Blackstone Private Credit | $50B+ | [[Blackstone]] | Largest private |
| Apollo private credit retail | Various | [[Apollo]] | Growing fast |

If redemption pressure spreads to these larger vehicles, the $1.8T private credit market faces a real liquidity event.

### The [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] link

This isn't just a liquidity story — it's a **credit quality story**. 13% of sold loans were internet software. The [[SaaS stock meltdown 2026]] is flowing through to private credit via:

1. Software company valuations collapse → equity cushion erodes
2. PE sponsors less willing to inject equity to support portfolio companies
3. Floating-rate debt squeezes borrowers already facing AI-driven revenue headwinds
4. Defaults rise → BDC NAVs decline → retail investors redeem → forced sales → more defaults

This is the feedback loop the market is pricing in.

### August 2007 parallel (El-Erian)

| 2007 | 2026 |
|------|------|
| Bear Stearns hedge funds gated | Blue Owl OBDC II gated |
| Subprime mortgage concentration | Software/tech loan concentration |
| CDOs with liquidity mismatch | Retail BDCs with liquidity mismatch |
| "Contained" narrative | "Finite-life wind-down" narrative |
| $10T mortgage market | $1.8T private credit market |

**Key difference:** Private credit ($1.8T) is much smaller than the 2007 mortgage market ($10T+) and better capitalized. But the pattern — opaque, concentrated, levered, with retail money in illiquid structures — rhymes.

## Bear vs bull

**Bear case (canary in the coalmine):**
- First retail BDC gate → template for larger funds
- Software concentration risk just starting to manifest
- 7 quarters of downgrades with no reversal
- El-Erian's August 2007 comparison has historical precedent
- Alt manager stocks already pricing in contagion

**Bull case (controlled wind-down):**
- Finite-life fund approaching natural 2027 end date
- Sold at 99.7% of par — no fire sale
- 80% cumulative returns, 9.3% annualized — strong track record
- Non-accruals under 2%, realized losses 23 bps
- Pro-rata distribution is fairer than first-come-first-served redemptions
- Larger funds (OBDC, ARCC) show no similar stress

---

## What to watch

- **OBDC redemption requests** — Blue Owl's $16B+ publicly-traded BDC. Any spike = escalation
- **Ares ARCC quarterly report** — largest BDC ($26B+), canary for broader market
- **Blackstone BCRED** — largest non-traded private credit fund. Any redemption pressure = systemic
- **Software default rates** — currently 4.55% for middle-market. Deutsche Bank models 13% under aggressive AI scenario
- **PIK loan growth** — payment-in-kind = borrowers can't service cash interest. Software is #1 PIK sector
- **March 31 quarter-end** — next redemption window for most semi-liquid funds
