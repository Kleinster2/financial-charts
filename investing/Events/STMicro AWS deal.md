## Strategic significance

For [[STMicro]]:
- First major hyperscale/data center customer — diversifies away from auto/industrial concentration
- Validates proprietary technology portfolio for AI and cloud workloads
- Opens new TAM in data center power, connectivity, and photonics
- CEO Chery cited data center photonics and cloud optical interconnect as 2026 growth drivers on Q4 earnings call

## Warrant dilution

24.8M shares at $28.38 = ~$704M potential proceeds if fully exercised. At ~910M shares outstanding, represents ~2.7% dilution. Vesting is conditional on purchase milestones — dilution only materializes as AWS buys.

## Market reaction

STM stock +8.27% on announcement day, adding ~$2.2B in market cap. Market read: structural positive outweighs dilution concern.
