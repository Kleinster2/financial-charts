## India's AI strategy

India is betting on **application-led innovation** over frontier model development. India's Economic Survey (Jan 2026) urged focus on large-scale deployment rather than chasing mega-models.

Key data points:
- [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon]] have committed a combined **$68B** in AI and cloud infrastructure in India through 2030
- 72M+ daily ChatGPT users by late 2025; 100M+ weekly (Altman, Feb 2026)
- India's $283B IT sector faces AI disruption — [[Jefferies]] predicts call centres could face **50% revenue hit** by 2030
- [[Vinod Khosla]]: IT services and BPOs "can almost completely disappear within five years"
- HCL CEO: Indian IT companies "will focus on turning profits and not being job creators"

## Context

Previous AI summits: Bletchley Park (UK, 2023), Seoul (2024), Paris (2025) — focused on safety commitments and voluntary pledges, criticized for producing few enforceable outcomes. India positioning itself as voice of the developing world in AI governance.

Delhi hotel prices surged — Taj Palace suite went from ~$2,200/night to $33,000+. India's Supreme Court allowed video conferencing for advocates during summit week due to traffic.
