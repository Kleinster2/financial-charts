## India's AI strategy

India is betting on **application-led innovation** over frontier model development. India's Economic Survey (Jan 2026) urged focus on large-scale deployment rather than chasing mega-models. No globally dominant frontier AI model yet — competitive edge is scale of deployment + talent.

**Three pillars: infrastructure, users, talent**

Infrastructure:
- [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon]] committed a combined **$68B** in AI and cloud infrastructure in India through 2030
- India approved **$18B** in semiconductor projects to build domestic chip supply chain
- Dec 2025: Amazon, Microsoft, Intel made additional AI infrastructure/chip commitments

Users:
- 72M+ daily ChatGPT users by late 2025; **100M+ weekly** (Altman, Feb 2026) — India is OpenAI's largest market
- India is [[Anthropic]]'s 2nd largest market for [[Claude]] after the US
- No major domestic chatbot rival — US labs competing for users and training data via free tiers
- Day 2: homegrown startups Sarvam AI and IIT Bombay-led BharatGen unveiling sovereign LLMs

Talent:
- 60%+ of Global Capability Centers (GCCs) established in last 2 years focused on AI/data/digital engineering
- 80%+ of GCCs expected in next 6–8 months will be AI-led
- "Chief AI Officer" roles increasingly being created in India (ANSR)
- [[Tech Mahindra]] CTO: India is an "AI talent factory"

**Disruption risks:**
- India's $283B IT sector faces AI disruption — [[Jefferies]] predicts call centres could face **50% revenue hit** by 2030
- [[Vinod Khosla]]: IT services and BPOs "can almost completely disappear within five years"
- HCL CEO: Indian IT companies "will focus on turning profits and not being job creators"
- Indian IT stocks dipping on AI disruption fears

**Notable absence:** [[Jensen Huang]] ([[Nvidia]] CEO) withdrew Feb 14 due to "unforeseen circumstances" — was originally expected to attend.

## Geopolitical context

Previous AI summits: Bletchley Park (UK, 2023), Seoul (2024), Paris (2025) — focused on safety commitments and voluntary pledges, criticized for producing few enforceable outcomes. India positioning itself as voice of the developing world in AI governance.

Summit coincides with US-India trade reset — the two nations pushing toward an interim trade deal. Modi government wants India to be a tech superpower: semiconductor manufacturing, Apple production shifts, VC-backed startup ecosystem, IPO surge on Indian exchanges.

Delhi hotel prices surged — Taj Palace suite went from ~$2,200/night to $33,000+. India's Supreme Court allowed video conferencing for advocates during summit week due to traffic.
