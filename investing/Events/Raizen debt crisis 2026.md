**Raízen debt crisis 2026** — Brazil's largest corporate debt crisis since [[Americanas]] (2023). The [[Shell]]-[[Cosan]] sugar/ethanol/fuel JV collapsed under R$70B+ gross debt after reckless expansion, a disastrous acquisition, E2G underperformance, and Selic rate shock. All three rating agencies stripped investment grade in one week (8-10 notch downgrades). Bonds trading at ~30 cents. Two competing rescue bids. Not yet in court-supervised restructuring.

## The numbers at crisis peak

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Net loss (Q3 FY25/26) | **R$15.65B (~$2.7B)** | 6x prior year |
| Impairment charge | R$11.1B (~$1.9B) | Non-cash; triggered by rating downgrades raising cost-of-capital |
| Underlying loss ex-impairment | R$4.5B (~$776M) | Nearly 2x YoY, worsening each quarter |
| Net revenue (Q3) | R$60.4B (~$10.4B) | Down 9.7% YoY |
| Adj EBITDA (Q3) | R$3.15B | Down 3.3% — core ops still generating cash, but insufficiently |
| Reported EBITDA (Q3) | **-R$4.4B** | Impairment wiped out operating profitability |

## Root causes — the five compounding failures

### 1. Reckless expansion (2016-2024)

Raízen deployed substantial capital to grow and open new business fronts starting 2016. Fuel distribution, convenience stores (Oxxo JV with [[Femsa]]), [[E2G]], sugar/ethanol capacity — all simultaneously. Result: "a more complex portfolio than ideal and high leverage at an unfavorable moment in the interest rate cycle" (internal source). Multiple new structures and management layers "distracted leadership's attention."

### 2. Disastrous Biosev acquisition (2021)

Acquired 9 mills from [[Louis Dreyfus Company]]. While Biosev's sugarcane fields were in better condition than Raízen's own, the mills were in regions where Raízen had never operated, far from existing clusters. Couldn't capture synergies or efficiency gains. Several of these mills now being sold back at losses — a significant portion of the R$5B in divestments over the past 12 months came from former Biosev assets.

### 3. E2G underdelivered

The bet on [[E2G|second-generation cellulosic ethanol]] fell short of expectations. Bonfim plant (world's largest E2G facility, 82M liters/yr capacity) not delivering promised returns. The Grupo Nós JV with [[Femsa]] (Oxxo stores in Brazil) was unwound. Other projects delivered less efficiency and weaker returns than promised.

### 4. Selic rate shock

[[Selic]] benchmark rate hikes in 2025 were devastating. Raízen's short-term reverse factoring arrangements (typically ~90 days, costing R$6-8B/year) were converted to longer-term financial instruments — primarily bond issuances — at a time of elevated interest rates. This conversion added **R$10.9B** in financial debt. Although total liabilities remained near R$120B, the maturity extension at higher rates created a debt spiral: interest accrues → more debt → more interest → cash consumed faster than operations generate it.

### 5. Asset sales too slow

CEO Nelson Gomes (replaced Mussa Oct-Nov 2024) launched cost-cutting and simplification. R$5B divested in 12 months — including former Biosev mills, the Leme sugar plant (R$425M), and Santa Elisa mill shutdown (R$1.045B freed). Argentina fuel distribution being sold to [[Mercuria Energy Group]] for >$1B. Aviation fuel unit under evaluation. But asset sales and lower capex couldn't keep pace with the surge in debt costs.

**One bright spot:** Intensified government enforcement against fuel fraud. Shutdown of Refit alone opened ~10% of the distribution market in São Paulo and Rio — absorbed by compliant operators like Raízen.

## Rating collapse

| Agency | Pre-crisis | Final (Feb 9-10) | Notches dropped | Trigger |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| [[Fitch Ratings]] | BBB (Jun 2024) | CCC | **10** | "Failure of shareholders to execute material capital injection" |
| [[S&P Global]] | BBB (Jan 2025) | CCC+ | **8** | Hiring of restructuring advisers = "opening move in restructuring" |
| [[Moody's]] | Baa3 | Caa1 | **9** | Negative outlook |

Fitch was most aggressive: BBB → BBB (negative, Jun 2025) → BBB- (RWN, Oct 2025) → B (morning Feb 9) → CCC (evening Feb 9). Five notches in seven hours.

**Feb 19 Fitch follow-up:** Shareholder pledges were **"too little, too late"** to prevent the downgrade.

**Forced selling cascade:** Institutional investors mandated to hold only investment-grade paper became forced sellers — accelerating the bond price collapse from par to ~30 cents.

## Bond prices

| Maturity | Coupon | Outstanding | Price (Feb 2026) | Implied loss |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Jan 2027 | 5.30% | $342M | — | — |
| Jul 2032 | 6.25% | $750M | Yields >14% | — |
| Mar 2034 | 6.45% | $1,000M | **42.4 cents** (was ~86.7 pre-Feb 9) | ~58% |
| Jan 2035 | 5.70% | $1,000M | **~44 cents** (YTM 18.76%) | ~56% |
| 2037 | 6.70% | $1,000M | — | — |
| Mar 2054 | 6.95% | $1,250M | **~30 cents** | ~70% |

Market is pricing in substantial creditor losses — consistent with a restructuring that includes debt-to-equity conversion and/or haircuts.

## The rescue battle

### Shell plan (Feb 18)

[[Shell]], which jointly controls Raízen with [[Cosan]] and had resisted committing more capital than its partner, shifted course after failing to find a third investor.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total injection | **~R$5B** |
| Shell contribution | **>R$3.5B** (larger than Cosan — a reversal) |
| Cosan/Ometto contribution | Remainder |
| Structure | **Keep Raízen whole** |
| Post-injection | Negotiate with R$55B creditors; initial debt-to-equity conversion likely |
| Follow-on offering | Possible — would dilute Shell if it doesn't participate |
| Control | Shell would NOT become controlling shareholder |

Creditor banks favor this simpler, faster approach.

### BTG/Cosan plan

[[Cosan]] and [[BTG Pactual]] submitted a competing proposal to Shell (Feb 13), with a response deadline the following day.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total injection | **R$8.3B+** |
| Cosan + BTG | R$3B |
| BTG PE arm | R$5.3B (into distribution business specifically) |
| Structure | **Split Raízen into two companies** — sugar/ethanol production + fuel distribution |
| Additional | Could increase with follow-on offering |

Some creditor banks oppose — argue splitting the company at this stage would weaken it further and complicate debt negotiations.

### Shell's IFRS constraint

[[Shell]] (44% owner) won't push above 50% — crossing that threshold forces [[IFRS]] consolidation of R$70B+ gross debt onto Shell's balance sheet. This is the structural reason Shell initially demanded equal contributions and why the follow-on offering matters (it dilutes Shell back below the threshold).

### Capital needed vs. offered

| Source | Amount needed |
|--------|--------------|
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] estimate | ~R$18B (to reach 2.5x leverage) |
| [[UBS BB]] estimate | R$20-25B (to reach 2.0-2.5x) |
| Shell plan offers | R$5B |
| BTG/Cosan plan offers | R$8.3B+ |

**The gap:** Even the larger BTG plan (R$8.3B) falls far short of what banks estimate is needed (R$18-25B). This is why Fitch says pledges are "too little, too late" — and why debt-to-equity conversion for creditors is likely necessary to close the gap.

## Advisers

| Party | Financial adviser | Legal adviser |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| [[Raizen]] | [[Rothschild]], [[Citigroup]] | [[Pinheiro Neto]], [[Cleary Gottlieb]] |
| [[Cosan]] | [[Itaú BBA]] | — |
| [[Shell]] | [[Lazard]] | — |
| Bondholder committee | [[Moelis]] | [[White & Case]] |

Bondholder committee formed Feb 11 — includes [[PIMCO]], [[BlackRock]], [[T. Rowe Price]]. Holds majority of USD bonds.

## Comparisons

### vs. Americanas (2023)

| Dimension | [[Americanas]] | Raízen |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Nature | Accounting fraud (R$25.3B hole) | Operational/financial mismanagement |
| Gross debt | R$43B | R$70B+ |
| Cause | Hidden supplier financing | Overexpansion + Selic shock + bad acquisition |
| Rating action | Immediate default | 8-10 notch downgrades to CCC |
| Resolution | Court-supervised restructuring (RJ) | Competing rescue bids, no RJ yet |
| Creditor losses | ~70-80% | Market pricing ~60-70% |
| Systemic impact | Brazilian credit market seizure | [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]] |

Raízen's gross debt is **larger** than Americanas', making this potentially Brazil's biggest corporate restructuring ever if it enters RJ.

### vs. Blue Owl OBDC II gate (same day)

Both events hit Feb 19, 2026 — one in Brazil (operational/rate-driven), one in US (AI disruption/liquidity-driven). Different causes, same week. [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] rattled US private credit; Raízen rattled Brazilian corporate bonds.

## What to watch

- **Shell vs BTG/Cosan decision** — Raízen board must choose between rescue proposals. Shell plan is simpler; BTG plan has more capital but splits the company
- **Creditor negotiations** — bondholder committee (PIMCO, BlackRock, T. Rowe Price) holds the cards. Debt-to-equity conversion terms will determine recovery rates
- **Court-supervised restructuring (RJ)** — not filed yet but remains the backstop if shareholder injection fails
- **[[B3]] R$1 minimum** — stock must recover above R$1 by May 2026 or face delisting sanctions
- **[[Selic]] trajectory** — if rates stay elevated or rise further, the debt spiral accelerates regardless of rescue
- **Argentina sale closing** — [[Mercuria Energy Group]] deal (>$1B) provides critical near-term cash
- **[[Mitsubishi]]/[[Mitsui]] stake sale** — strategic investor could provide both capital and operational partnership
- **Contagion** — impact on Brazilian corporate bond market, [[Cosan]] credit (S&P revised outlook to negative), and broader EM high-yield sentiment
- **Sugar/ethanol prices** — operational cash flow depends on commodity prices and São Paulo drought recovery
- **E2G write-off** — will Bonfim plant be sold, mothballed, or restructured?

## Investment implications

| Thesis | Expression | Risk |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Distressed debt play | Buy bonds at 30 cents, bet on 50-60 cent recovery | Restructuring could impose larger haircuts |
| Short [[Cosan]] | S&P negative outlook, contagion risk | Capital injection could stabilize |
| Long Brazilian fuel distribution | If split happens, distribution is the crown jewel | Split may not happen |
| [[Selic]] rate sensitivity | Raízen is the extreme case of rate-driven distress | Applies to entire Brazilian corporate sector |
| Avoid Brazilian corporate IG | Forced selling cascade can hit any downgraded name | Spreads may overshoot |

## Who saw it coming

Multiple analysts flagged the crisis openly — but nobody acted decisively, and the rating agencies held investment grade until it was too late.

### Aug 2025 — AInvest
- Net debt had already surged **56% YoY to R$49B** by June 2025
- Cash burn of **R$7B in Q1 alone**
- E2G and sustainable aviation fuel investments "yet to yield financial returns"
- Selic at 13.75% crushing borrowing costs
- Citi analyst Gabriel Barra noted FCF would remain negative until 2026/27
- Article literally framed it as "high-risk, high-reward" and warned of insolvency

### May 2025 — AInvest
- 6% sugarcane yield shortfall + wildfires damaged crops
- Q3 FY24/25 net loss of R$2.57B (vs R$793M profit prior year)
- "Asset sales may not reverse the trend fast enough"

### Aug 2025 — Easy Brazil Investing
- Warned "cheap can always get cheaper" and that extreme leverage could "raise the specter" of dilutive equity raises

### Jun 2025 — Fitch
- Revised outlook to **negative** while still affirming BBB — the first formal agency warning, 8 months before the 10-notch collapse

### Raízen insiders (per Valor Internacional)
- Internal sources acknowledged the portfolio was "more complex than ideal" with "high leverage at an unfavorable moment"
- Organizational complexity "distracted leadership's attention"
- Problems were known **"for at least two years"** before the Feb 2026 blowup

### The pattern

The warning signs were visible from mid-2024 onward — rising leverage, negative FCF, failed E2G bet, Biosev integration problems. But the rating agencies held investment grade until Feb 9, 2026. Fitch maintained BBB through Jun 2025, only went negative in Jun 2025, and still held BBB- through Oct 2025. **The 10-notch collapse in one week was a catch-up, not a leading indicator.**

Nobody shorted it publicly in the way Hindenburg or Muddy Waters would — there's no activist short report on record. The warnings came from fundamental analysts who flagged the math but didn't sound the alarm loudly enough for it to matter.

**The real story:** the rating agencies were the last to know, as usual. BBB in June 2025, CCC by February 2026. Investors who relied on ratings got crushed by the forced-selling cascade.
