## The scheme

**"Capitalismo de compadrio"** — crony capitalism, Brazilian style. State contracts + development bank financing + political donations = extraction cycle.

### Core mechanism

```
Petrobras contracts inflated 1-3%
    → Kickbacks to construction cartel
        → Cartel funds political donations (caixa 2)
            → Politicians appoint Petrobras/BNDES boards
                → More contracts to cartel...
```

### Key players

| Actor | Role | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Odebrecht** | Lead contractor, bribe payer | $2.6B global settlement |
| **JBS/J&F** | Meatpacker, bribe payer | R$10.3B fine |
| **OAS** | Construction cartel | Bankruptcy |
| **Andrade Gutierrez** | Construction cartel | Leniency deal |
| **Camargo Corrêa** | Construction cartel | Leniency deal |
| **Petrobras** | Contract vehicle | Victim (officially) |
| **BNDES** | Financing vehicle | Enabled "national champions" |

### Political parties implicated

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **PT** (Workers' Party) | Lula, Dilma — main beneficiaries |
| **MDB** | Temer, Cunha — coalition brokers |
| **PSDB** | Aécio Neves — opposition also dirty |
| **PP** | Congressional votes for sale |

## State banks as extraction vehicles

| Bank | Role | Crony function |
|------|------|----------------|
| **BNDES** | Development bank | Below-market loans to "national champions" |
| **Banco do Brasil** | State commercial | Directed lending, political board |
| **Caixa Econômica Federal** | Housing/social | Patronage vehicle, political trustees |

### The BNDES loop

```
Treasury transfers R$400B+ to BNDES (2008-2014)
    → BNDES lends at TJLP (below-market rate)
        → "National champions" grow (JBS: R$8.1B, Odebrecht: R$8B+)
            → Champions make political donations
                → Government appoints BNDES board
                    → More cheap capital...
```

### BNDES disasters

| Recipient | BNDES funds | Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **JBS** | R$8.1B (2007-2014) | Batista brothers convicted; J&F paid R$10.3B fine |
| **Odebrecht** | R$8B+ | $2.6B global bribery settlement |
| **Oi** | R$12B+ | Largest bankruptcy in Brazilian history (2016) |
| **LBR Lácteos** | R$700M | Dairy merger failed, liquidated |
| **Bertin** | R$2.5B | Merged into JBS — BNDES orchestrated |

**JBS case:** Batista brothers used BNDES capital to build world's largest meatpacker, then bribed 1,900+ politicians. BNDES made money on paper (equity stake appreciated) but enabled the corruption machine.

## Banco do Brasil — Mensalão (2005)

Precursor scandal to Lava Jato.

BB marketing contracts (Visanet, advertising) used to fund monthly payments ("mensalão") to congressional allies. PT operatives convicted. BB wasn't the perpetrator but its contracts were the vehicle.

## Caixa — Minha Casa Minha Vida

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Program | Social housing — 5M+ units built |
| Crony angle | Construction contracts to politically connected builders |
| Inflated costs | Builders padded costs, kicked back to officials |
| Quality | Many units defective, abandoned |

Caixa was the financing vehicle; builders got contracts based on political relationships, not competitive bidding.

## FI-FGTS — workers' fund capture

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fund | Workers' severance guarantee fund |
| Manager | Caixa Econômica Federal |
| Assets | ~R$500B |
| Problem | Forced into infrastructure "investments" by political trustees |

| Failed investment | Loss |
|-------------------|------|
| **Sete Brasil** | R$3B+ — drillships for Petrobras, company bankrupt |
| **Porto Maravilha** | Rio port redevelopment — underperforming |
| **Norte Energia (Belo Monte)** | Controversial dam — cost overruns |

Workers' mandatory savings directed into politically favored projects. When projects failed, workers bore losses through below-market returns.

---

## Pension fund capture

| Fund | Parent | Losses |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Petros** | Petrobras | Sete Brasil drillships, refinery cost overruns |
| **Funcef** | Caixa | Forced into crony deals by political trustees |
| **Previ** | Banco do Brasil | Largest fund (~R$250B), board appointments |

Government-appointed trustees directed pension investments into politically favored projects — when deals failed, retirees absorbed losses.

## BTG Pactual connection (2015)

The only major private bank directly connected to Lava Jato:

- André Esteves (founder/CEO) arrested during investigation
- Charged with obstruction — allegedly tried to buy witness silence
- Charges eventually dropped; Esteves returned as chairman
- Bank survived but Esteves briefly lost control

**Note:** Other private bank failures (1990s political family banks, Banco Santos, Panamericano, etc.) predate Lava Jato. See [[Brazilian cronyism]] for full private bank history.

## Aftermath

| Event | Date | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Moro joins Bolsonaro government | 2019 | Lead judge becomes Justice Minister — raised bias questions |
| Supreme Court annuls Lula convictions | 2021 | Ruled Moro was biased; Lula eligible to run again |
| Lava Jato task force dissolved | 2021 | Cases transferred to regular prosecutors |
| Lula wins presidency | 2022 | Returns to power |
| Dallagnol loses congressional seat | 2023 | Lead prosecutor's conviction overturned on appeal |

**The pendulum swung back:** Lava Jato disrupted but didn't eliminate the pattern. Task force was dissolved, key convictions annulled, Lula returned to presidency.

## Why it matters

Brazil shows [[Crony capitalism]] can exist in democracies with functioning courts — until investigators get traction. But institutions can also be captured to reverse progress.

See [[Brazilian cronyism]] for scandals beyond Lava Jato (Mensalão, orçamento secreto, structural cronyism).

**Investment implications:**
- State-connected companies (Petrobras, BNDES beneficiaries) carry political risk
- "National champions" policy can mean subsidized cronyism
- Regime change can mean both crackdown risk AND reversal of crackdowns
- Due diligence must include political connection mapping
