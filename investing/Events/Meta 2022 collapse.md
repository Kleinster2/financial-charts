## Drivers

**ATT impact** — Apple's App Tracking Transparency broke Meta's ad targeting model. Users opted out of tracking (~75% opt-out rate), forcing reliance on less precise signals. Meta estimated $10B annual revenue hit.

**Reality Labs burn** — Zuckerberg's metaverse bet consumed $10B+ annually with no clear path to returns. Investors questioned capital allocation as core business weakened.

**TikTok competition** — Short-form video dominated attention. Instagram Reels launched defensively but monetized poorly vs feed/stories.

**Macro environment** — Fed rate hikes crushed growth multiples. Meta's P/E compressed from 25x to 9x.

**User growth stall** — Facebook DAUs declined QoQ for first time ever in Q4 2021. Narrative shifted from growth stock to mature utility.

## Recovery

Zuckerberg's "Year of Efficiency" (2023):
- 21,000 total layoffs (25% of workforce)
- Reality Labs spending capped
- AI pivot: Llama models, Reels recommendations
- Operating margins recovered from 20% to 40%+

Stock recovered from $88 to $600+ by late 2024 — one of the greatest turnarounds in tech history.
