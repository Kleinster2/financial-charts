| Combined valuation | **$1.25 trillion** |
| SpaceX valuation | $1 trillion |
| xAI valuation | $250 billion |
| Share price | ~$527/share |
| Exchange ratio | 0.1433 xAI → 1 SpaceX |

**Legal counsel:**
- SpaceX: Sullivan & Cromwell
- xAI: Gibson Dunn & Crutcher

## Strategic rationale

**Official thesis: Space-based AI compute**

> "Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment."
> — SpaceX announcement

**The physics case:**
- Solar panels in orbit generate 5x more power (no night, weather, atmosphere)
- Space provides efficient cooling (radiator pointed away from sun)
- Musk predicts: "Within 2-3 years, the lowest cost to generate AI compute will be in space"

**Scale ambitions:**
- 100 GW/year of solar-powered AI satellites within decade
- ~10,000 Starship flights/year required
- Long-term: 1 TW/year, eventually 100 TW (lunar manufacturing)

**Musk at Davos (Jan 2026):**
> "To harness even a millionth of our Sun's energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!"

## Real story: The 12-year arc

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2012 | Demis Hassabis warns Musk: AI could follow humans to Mars, destroy colony |
| 2014 | Google acquires DeepMind; Musk tried to block (offered 5% of Tesla) |
| 2015 | Musk + Altman found OpenAI as Google counterweight |
| 2017-18 | Musk demands 50-60% equity, children to control AGI; rejected |
| Feb 2018 | Musk leaves OpenAI board |
| Mar 2023 | Signs letter calling for 6-month AI moratorium |
| Jul 2023 | Launches xAI (4 months after signing moratorium) |
| Mar 2025 | xAI acquires X (Twitter) via share swap |
| Jan 2026 | Tesla invests $2B in xAI |
| **Feb 2, 2026** | **SpaceX acquires xAI** |

**Court documents** (Musk v. OpenAI, trial Apr 2026):
- Musk wanted $80B foundation with his children controlling AGI
- Called Hassabis capable of creating "AGI dictatorship"
- Wrote: "Deepmind is causing me extreme mental stress"

## xAI's burn problem

| Metric | xAI | OpenAI |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Monthly burn | ~$1B | ~$750M |
| 2025 revenue | ~$500M | ~$12-13B |
| 2025 losses | ~$13B | ~$9B |
| Burn-to-revenue | **26:1** | 0.7:1 |
| MAU | 64M | 800-900M WAU |

**Translation:** xAI's valuation only makes sense with exit strategy. Merger + IPO provides that.

---

## Grok regulatory exposure

**Under investigation in jurisdictions representing 2B+ people:**

| Regulator | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| California AG (Bonta) | Non-consensual sexual imagery, CSAM |
| Internet Watch Foundation | "Criminal imagery of children" found |
| 35 US state AGs | Joint letter demanding action |
| EU Commission | Digital Services Act proceeding |

**Conflict:** SpaceX holds ~$22B in government contracts (NASA, DoD, intelligence). Merging with AI company under investigation creates unprecedented regulatory questions.

---

## IPO implications

**SpaceX IPO expected mid-2026:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target valuation | $1.5T+ |
| Raise | $30-50B (largest IPO ever) |
| Purpose | Fund Starship, space data centers |
| Timing | ~June 2026 (Musk's birthday) |

**Investors:** xAI investors convert at 0.1433 ratio → liquidity via IPO.

## "Muskonomy" consolidation

```
Tesla ($2B invested in xAI → now SpaceX subsidiary)
    ↓
xAI (Grok + X platform)
    ↓  
SpaceX (rockets, Starlink, Starshield, space DCs)
```

**Prior consolidations:**
- 2025: xAI acquires X (share swap)
- 2016: Tesla acquires SolarCity (stock deal)
- Now: SpaceX acquires xAI

**Tesla excluded:** Creates fiduciary concerns. Tesla shareholders' $2B xAI investment now sits in SpaceX subsidiary.

## Key quotes

**Musk on merger (Feb 2026):**
> "This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!"

**Musk on existential stakes (Dec 2025):**
> "We might have AI smarter than any human by the end of this year... probably by 2030-31, AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively."

**Musk on reconciling the risk (Jul 2025):**
> "Will this be bad or good for humanity? Even if it wasn't going to be good, I'd at least like to be alive to see it happen."

---

## Investment implications

**Winners:**
- SpaceX employees/investors (IPO liquidity)
- xAI investors (0.1433 exchange → SpaceX stock)
- Starlink (V3 satellites add 20x capacity)

**Risks:**
- Grok investigations could taint SpaceX
- xAI burn continues (~$1B/mo)
- Musk conflict-of-interest concerns
- Regulatory scrutiny on defense + AI combo

**Watch:**
- April 2026: Musk v. OpenAI trial (Oakland)
- H2 2026: SpaceX IPO
- DOGE/government contract exposure
