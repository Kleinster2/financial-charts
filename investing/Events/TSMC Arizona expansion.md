**Date**: Ongoing (announced 2020, phased buildout through 2028+)

## What happened

[[TSMC]] is building advanced fabs in Arizona as geographic diversification and geopolitical risk mitigation.

## Timeline

| Phase | Node | [[Target]] |
|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 4nm/5nm | Mass production 2025 |
| Phase 2 | 3nm | 2027 |
| Phase 3 | 2nm | 2028 |
| **Phase 4+** | TBD | Land acquired Jan 2026 |

## January 2026 expansion

**Major land purchase** — TSMC bought hundreds of acres adjacent to existing Arizona site.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announcement | Jan 15, 2026 (part of [[US-Taiwan relations]] trade deal) |
| Land | "Hundreds of acres" adjacent to current site |
| Context | $500B [[Taiwan]] chip investment commitment |
| Source | Commerce Secretary Lutnick |

Part of broader US-[[Taiwan]] trade agreement:
- $250B direct investment from [[Taiwan]] chip/tech companies
- $250B [[Taiwan]] government credit guarantees
- Tariffs on [[Taiwan]] goods cut to 15%

Signals potential Phase 4+ expansion beyond original 3-phase plan.

## Why it matters

This is [[TSMC]]'s answer to [[Taiwan concentration risk]] — but it's **insurance, not replacement**.

Key point: Arizona is ~5% of TSMC's total capacity. It cannot absorb [[Taiwan]]'s role in a real contingency.

## Strategic logic

- Respond to customer pressure ([[Apple]], [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] want U.S. supply)
- Qualify for [[CHIPS Act]] subsidies ($6.6B)
- Reduce single-point-of-failure exposure
- Deliberate [[Node lag as strategy]] — Arizona trails [[Taiwan]] by 1-2 nodes

## What it reveals about TSMC

- Execution certainty over speed
- Geographic expansion as cost to manage, not growth vector
- [[Taiwan]] remains center of leading-edge learning

## US vs [[Taiwan]] economics (SemiAnalysis, Nov 2025)

**The margin compression is severe:**

| Metric | [[Taiwan]] (Fab 18) | US (Fab 21) | Premium |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Gross margin per wafer** | **62%** | **8%** | **~8x compression** |
| Total cost per wafer | $6,681 | $16,123 | +141% |
| Gross margin $ per wafer | $10,819 | $1,377 | -87% |

**Cost breakdown (5nm, $/wafer):**

| Item | [[Taiwan]] | US | Premium |
|------|--------|-----|---------|
| Depreciation | $1,500 | $7,289 | **+386%** |
| Labor cost | $1,800 | $3,600 | +100% |
| Raw materials | $1,520 | $3,040 | +100% |
| Overhead | $471 | $803 | +70% |
| Utilities | $630 | $630 | 0% |
| Consumables | $760 | $760 | 0% |
| Variable costs | $5,181 | $8,833 | +71% |

**Capacity difference:**

| Metric | [[Taiwan]] | US |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Wafer starts/month | 90,000 | 24,000 |
| Fab capex | $27.0B | $14.4B |
| Wafer equipment | $22.95B | $8.6B |
| Non-wafer equipment | $4.05B | $5.69B |

**Why depreciation is 4x higher:**
- US fab produces 4x fewer wafers (24K vs 90K/month)
- Same equipment costs spread over fewer units
- Wafers carry a "mortgage payment" from underutilization

**Why labor is 2x higher:**
- US workers less experienced, require more per wafer
- [[Taiwan]] work culture (Morris Chang): "If it breaks at 1 AM, in [[Taiwan]] it's fixed at 2 AM. In the US, it's fixed the next morning."
- Option to bring [[Taiwan]] engineers adds cost

**Strategic implication:**
- Arizona is a **geopolitical cost center**, not a profit center
- Customers ([[NVIDIA]], [[Apple]]) support it for supply chain resilience
- TSMC accepts margin compression as insurance premium
- US expansion serves purpose beyond economics

## Contrast with [[Samsung Taylor pivot]]

| | TSMC Arizona | [[Samsung]] Taylor |
|--|--------------|----------------|
| Philosophy | [[Insurance]] | Competitive reset |
| Node approach | Lag [[Taiwan]] | Leapfrog to leading edge |
| Risk profile | Low variance | High variance |
