**Date**: Ongoing (announced 2020, phased buildout through 2028+)

## What happened

[[TSMC]] is building advanced fabs in Arizona as geographic diversification and geopolitical risk mitigation.

## Timeline

| Phase | Node | Target |
|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 4nm/5nm | Mass production 2025 |
| Phase 2 | 3nm | 2027 |
| Phase 3 | 2nm | 2028 |

## Why it matters

This is [[TSMC]]'s answer to [[Taiwan concentration risk]] — but it's **insurance, not replacement**.

Key point: Arizona is ~5% of TSMC's total capacity. It cannot absorb Taiwan's role in a real contingency.

## Strategic logic

- Respond to customer pressure (Apple, NVIDIA, AMD want U.S. supply)
- Qualify for [[CHIPS Act]] subsidies ($6.6B)
- Reduce single-point-of-failure exposure
- Deliberate [[Node lag as strategy]] — Arizona trails Taiwan by 1-2 nodes

## What it reveals about TSMC

- Execution certainty over speed
- Geographic expansion as cost to manage, not growth vector
- Taiwan remains center of leading-edge learning

## Contrast with [[Samsung Taylor pivot]]

| | TSMC Arizona | Samsung Taylor |
|--|--------------|----------------|
| Philosophy | Insurance | Competitive reset |
| Node approach | Lag Taiwan | Leapfrog to leading edge |
| Risk profile | Low variance | High variance |
