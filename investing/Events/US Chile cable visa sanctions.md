**US Chile cable visa sanctions** — US State Department revoked visas for three [[Chile]]an government officials (Feb 20, 2026) over their role advancing the [[Chile-China Express]] submarine cable project linking Valparaiso to Hong Kong. First use of visa sanctions against a treaty ally over telecom infrastructure.

## What happened

On Feb 20, 2026, Secretary of State [[Marco Rubio]] announced visa restrictions on three Chilean nationals who "knowingly directed, authorized, funded, provided significant support to, and/or carried out activities that compromised critical telecommunications infrastructure and undermined regional security."

| Official | Role |
|----------|------|
| Juan Carlos Muñoz | Minister of Transport and Telecommunications |
| Claudio Araya | Undersecretary of Telecommunications |
| Guillermo Petersen | Head of [[Subtel]] cabinet |

All three — plus immediate family members — are now ineligible for US entry. Existing US visas revoked.

## The cable at issue

The [[Chile-China Express]] (CChE) — a proposed submarine cable from Valparaiso to Hong Kong, operated by [[China Mobile]] and [[Inchcape Shipping Services]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Route | Valparaiso → Hong Kong |
| Length | 10,000+ km |
| Capacity | Up to 16 Tbps per fiber |
| Operators | [[China Mobile]], Inchcape Shipping Services |
| Status | Under consideration |

## US rationale

Data sovereignty and intelligence risk. [[China]]'s 2017 Cybersecurity Law requires companies and citizens to cooperate with state intelligence services. Data transiting Chinese-managed infrastructure could be made available to Beijing.

US Ambassador Brandon Judd framed it as a question of "who will have hegemony over communications infrastructure in the 21st century" and flagged "the risks we see in redundant Chinese submarine cables."

The US prefers the [[Humboldt Cable]] — a [[Google]]-partnered alternative routing Chile to [[Australia]] via French Polynesia, using NEC ([[Japan]]) technology. Already under installation.

## Chilean response

Minister Muñoz: "Lo lamento profundamente" (I deeply regret it). Stressed that [[Chile]] evaluates projects "based on their own merits" without discriminating by origin, and would not approve projects threatening sovereignty.

[[Chile]] is caught between its largest trading partner ([[China]] — mostly copper exports) and its security ally (US). The Boric government is in its final stretch, limiting its room to maneuver.

## Why this matters

| Dimension | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|
| Precedent | First visa sanctions against a sitting allied cabinet minister over telecom infrastructure |
| Escalation | US moving from diplomatic pressure to personal sanctions on allied officials |
| Pattern | Extends US [[Submarine Cables]] strategy from blocking Chinese vendors to punishing allied governments that engage them |
| LatAm signal | Message to other LatAm nations ([[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]]) considering Chinese infrastructure |
| Chile squeeze | [[China]] is Chile's #1 trade partner; US is primary security partner. Binary choice imposed. |
