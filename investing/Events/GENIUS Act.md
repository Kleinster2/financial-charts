## Strategic Impact

**Domestic:**
*   Legitimizes **USDC** ([[Circle]]) and **PYUSD** ([[PayPal]]) as part of the US payment system.
*   Clears the path for **Circle IPO**.
*   Likely squeezes algorithmic or under-collateralized stablecoins.

**Geopolitical:**
*   Positions USD stablecoins as the "Digital Dollar" to fight the [[Digital Yuan]].
*   Part of the [[US-China financial war]].

## Winners & Losers

**Winners:**
*   [[Circle]] (Fully compliant, IPO ready)
*   [[PayPal]] (PYUSD legitimized)
*   [[Coinbase]] (USDC revenue share)
*   **US Treasury** (Stablecoins become major buyers of T-bills)

**Losers:**
*   **[[Tether]] (USDT)** (Offshore, opaque, faces pressure)
*   **Algorithmic Stablecoins** (Likely banned/restricted)

## Implementation timeline

Regulators expected to finalize licensing, custody, and compliance requirements by **July 18, 2026** (one-year anniversary). OCC has begun granting conditional bank charters to stablecoin firms — [[Stripe]]'s Bridge subsidiary received one in Feb 2026.

## Meta stablecoin integration (Feb 2026)

The GENIUS Act's regulatory clarity is enabling the largest potential stablecoin deployment yet: [[Meta]] is testing stablecoin payments across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp for H2 2026, with [[Stripe]]/Bridge as the likely infrastructure partner. 3.5B daily active users. Focus on creator payouts and ~$100 cross-border transfers.

This is precisely what the Act was designed to unlock — Big Tech adopting USD stablecoins as payment rails, reinforcing dollar dominance in digital commerce. [[Circle]] (USDC) is the likely beneficiary as the primary regulated, US-compliant stablecoin.
