# EU "Made in Europe" Tech Rules (Industrial Accelerator Act)

On **February 26, 2026**, the [[European Commission]] will publish the **Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA)** — a landmark law requiring that products receiving public subsidies or purchased through public procurement meet minimum "made in [[Europe]]" content thresholds. The proposal was developed by Industry Commissioner **Stéphane Séjourné** (France).

## What's Being Proposed

The IAA ties **€2+ trillion** in annual EU public procurement (14% of GDP) to local content requirements across strategic sectors:

| Sector | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Solar panels** | Inverter + 2 main components EU-made after Year 1; 3 components after Year 3 |
| **Electric vehicles** | Assembly in EU + 70% of components by value (excl. battery) EU-made |
| **Aluminium** | 25% minimum EU-made and low-carbon for subsidized production |
| **Concrete** | 5% EU-made minimum |
| **Steel** | Voluntary low-carbon label for emissions intensity |
| **Batteries** | Covered as "key strategic sector" (specifics TBD) |
| **Hydrogen manufacturing** | Covered |
| **Nuclear power plants** | Covered |
| **Wind energy** | Covered |

**Goal:** Manufacturing to reach **20% of EU GDP by 2035** (not seen since early 1990s).

### Foreign Investment Restrictions

For investments **>€100M** in strategic sectors where the investor's home country controls **≥40% of global manufacturing capacity** (targeting [[China]]):
- Foreign investor **cannot hold majority stake** in EU company
- Investor must **license IP** to benefit EU investment
- Effectively mirrors China's 1980s forced joint venture model — turned against China itself

### Definition of "Europe"

- **European Economic Area** (27 EU + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)
- Excludes [[United Kingdom]] initially
- Commission can add **"trusted partners"** later — countries with WTO GPA commitments or contributing to EU competitiveness/security
- UK and [[Japan]] expected to qualify as trusted partners

### Exceptions

- Product made by only one company worldwide → exemption
- Switching to EU-made would cost **≥30% more** → exemption possible

## Political Dynamics

**Supporters:**
- **[[France]]** — strongest backer; Séjourné is the architect; [[Macron]] pushing industrial sovereignty agenda
- **1,100+ business leaders** co-signed Séjourné's article supporting the plan (Feb 2026)
- **[[Ursula von der Leyen]]** — called European preference a "necessary instrument" but wants "robust economic analysis"

**Skeptics/Opponents:**
- **[[Germany]]** — Chancellor [[Friedrich Merz]] wants "made *with* Europe" (inclusive of trade partners), called European preference a "last resort"
- **[[Italy]]** — PM [[Meloni]] aligned with Germany on openness
- **Sweden, Czech Republic** — warned of deterred investment and higher prices
- **Carmakers** — notably absent from the 1,100 signatories; global supply chains at risk
- **German VDA (auto industry)** — "critical of local content approaches" given 70% of jobs are export-dependent
- **Aerospace (ASD Europe)** — reliant on global supply chains, 40% global market share at risk
- **Chinese Chamber of Commerce to EU** — called measures "likely to undermine investment confidence"

## Comparison to US and China

| | EU IAA | US [[CHIPS Act]] / [[IRA]] | China |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Public procurement + subsidy conditions | Direct subsidies + tax credits | Direct subsidies + market access requirements |
| **Local content** | Explicit % thresholds | Domestic manufacturing required for credits | Forced JVs (historically), subsidies |
| **Scope** | Clean tech, batteries, EVs, steel, nuclear | Semiconductors (CHIPS), clean energy (IRA) | Broad industrial policy |
| **FDI restrictions** | >€100M cap in dominated sectors | CFIUS review | Case-by-case |

The EU is converging toward the US/China model of **explicit industrial protectionism**, but via procurement leverage rather than direct subsidies (which EU state aid rules constrain).

## Relation to European Chips Act

The **€43B [[European Chips Act]]** (2023) focused on semiconductor manufacturing subsidies — [[TSMC]] Dresden (€5B), [[Intel]] Magdeburg (€10B subsidy, now delayed/uncertain). The IAA is **complementary, not a replacement** — it adds procurement-side demand creation to supply-side subsidies. Semiconductors are not explicitly listed in the draft's sector requirements but fall under "key strategic technologies."

## Timeline & Legislative Process

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Feb 26, 2026 | Commission publishes proposal |
| H1 2026 | European Parliament committee review |
| 2026-2027 | Parliament + Council negotiations (ordinary legislative procedure) |
| 2027-2028? | Earliest possible entry into force |

The proposal has already been **delayed twice**. Fierce debate between France and Germany/Nordics means significant amendments are likely. Final law could look quite different from the draft.

## Investment Implications

**Potential beneficiaries of EU industrial sovereignty push:**
- **EU clean tech manufacturers** — solar, wind, battery makers with EU production
- **EU steel/aluminium** with low-carbon processes
- **EU auto suppliers** with high domestic content
- Companies already manufacturing in EU benefit from procurement preference

**At risk:**
- **Chinese manufacturers** — direct target of FDI restrictions and procurement exclusion
- **Companies with non-EU supply chains** — higher compliance costs
- **Export-oriented EU industries** — retaliation risk

**Notable:** Semiconductors not explicitly covered in the draft's detailed requirements, so direct impact on [[ASML]], [[Infineon]], etc. is **indirect** — they benefit from the broader EU industrial sovereignty narrative and potential future inclusion.
