## What Apple gets

**Silent speech technology:** AI that interprets facial micro-movements to understand mouthed/whispered speech. Enables non-verbal device interaction.

**Use cases:**
- Silent Siri commands through AirPods
- Speech recognition in noisy environments
- Non-verbal control for Vision Pro
- Private conversations in public spaces

**Proven leadership:** CEO [[Aviad Maizels]] previously sold [[PrimeSense]] to Apple (2013), which became Face ID.

## Strategic context

Apple has lagged in AI. Tim Cook acknowledged in Q3 2025 earnings call: "We're open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap."

This is Apple's first major AI acquisition under that mandate. The timing — as competitors ship AI features — signals urgency.

**Apple SVP Johny Srouji:** Q.ai "is a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning."

## Why it matters

1. **Differentiated AI approach** — Not another LLM play; hardware-integrated silent speech is unique
2. **Wearables upgrade path** — AirPods, Vision Pro, future glasses all benefit
3. **Maizels track record** — Face ID was transformative; Apple is betting on repeat
4. **Scale** — 2nd largest acquisition signals seriousness about AI catch-up
