**Apple MP Materials partnership (July 2025)** — $500M deal for [[Apple]] to source recycled rare earth magnets from [[MP Materials]]. First major US tech company to secure domestic rare earth supply.

---

## Deal terms

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Value | $500M |
| Announcement | July 15, 2025 |
| Product | Recycled rare earth magnets |
| Facility | Fort Worth, Texas ("Independence") |
| Feedstock | Mountain Pass, California |
| First shipments | 2027 |
| Volume | Hundreds of millions of Apple devices |

---

## What Apple gets

- Domestic magnet supply (reduces China dependence)
- Recycled feedstock (sustainability angle)
- Priority access to US rare earth capacity
- Hedge against [[Rare earth leverage]] escalation

---

## What MP Materials gets

- $500M anchor investment
- Apple engineering partnership
- Volume commitment for scale economics
- Credibility for other customer discussions
- Stock +20% on announcement

---

## The recycling innovation

Apple and MP spent 5 years developing:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Pilot program | 2020-2025 |
| Commercial line | Mountain Pass |
| Inputs | End-of-life magnets, scrap, device components |
| Output | Recycled rare earth feedstock |

**Significance**: Recycling reduces dependence on mining. Apple's device ecosystem = massive feedstock source.

## Pentagon connection

Same month, DoD announced:
- Multibillion-dollar MP Materials investment
- Magnet plant expansion
- 11,000 short tons/year capacity by 2028

Apple and DoD both backing MP = validation of strategic importance.

---

## Limitations

| Gap | Implication |
|-----|-------------|
| No [[Dysprosium]] | Heavy REE still China-sourced |
| 2027 start | No protection today |
| Volume | Small vs global demand |

MP does light rare earths (Nd, Pr). The critical heavy REEs for high-temp applications still come from China.

---

## Strategic context

This deal happened amid:
- China's April 2025 rare earth controls
- October 2025 control escalation
- 6x price gap between China domestic and export markets
- [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] and retaliation

Apple saw the writing on the wall. See [[Rare earth leverage]], [[China retaliatory toolkit]].

---

## Implications

**For Apple:**
- Partial supply chain hedge
- Sustainability narrative
- First-mover advantage in domestic rare earth sourcing

**For MP Materials:**
- Anchor customer enables scale
- Validates US rare earth strategy
- Sets template for other tech/defense deals

**For industry:**
- Proves demand for non-China rare earths
- Recycling as viable supply source
- Model for other companies to follow
