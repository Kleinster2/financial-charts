## What happened

### Dash for dollars

COVID uncertainty triggered simultaneous:
- **Corporate drawdowns** — companies drew credit lines for cash buffer
- **Fund redemptions** — investors fled to cash
- **Margin calls** — leveraged positions unwound
- **FX hedging demand** — non-US institutions needed USD to meet obligations

Result: acute shortage of dollar funding globally.

### Cross-currency basis blowout

| Currency pair | Widening (Jan → Mar peak) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| EUR/USD | ~55 bp |
| JPY/USD | ~80 bp |
| MYR/USD | ~90 bp |
| PHP/USD | ~90 bp |

Negative basis = premium to access synthetic dollar funding via FX swaps. Wider = more stress.

### Treasury market dysfunction

Even US Treasuries — the "risk-free" asset — traded erratically:
- Bid-ask spreads widened 10x
- Dealers couldn't intermediate
- Forced selling by leveraged funds (basis trade unwind)
- Fed had to buy Treasuries to restore functioning

## Fed response

### Swap lines

**Standing arrangements (reactivated Mar 15):**
- [[Bank of Canada]]
- [[Bank of England]]
- [[Bank of Japan]]
- [[European Central Bank]]
- [[Swiss National Bank]]

**Temporary arrangements (Mar 19):**
- [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]
- [[Banco Central do Brasil]]
- [[Bank of Korea]]
- [[Banco de México]]
- [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]]
- [[Sveriges Riksbank]]
- [[Danmarks Nationalbank]]
- [[Norges Bank]]
- [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]

### Swap line terms

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Rate | OIS + 25bp |
| Tenor | 7-day and 84-day |
| Frequency | Daily auctions |
| Peak usage | ~$450B (late March) |

### FIMA repo facility

Allowed foreign central banks to temporarily exchange Treasury holdings for dollars — backstop for those without swap lines.

## Market impact

### Immediate

| Market | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Cross-currency basis | Normalized by April |
| VIX | Peaked at 82.69 (Mar 16) |
| S&P 500 | -34% peak-to-trough |
| Corporate spreads | IG +300bp, HY +600bp |
| EM currencies | Sharp depreciation, then recovery |

### Policy precedent

Fed demonstrated willingness to:
- Provide unlimited USD liquidity globally
- Backstop Treasury market functioning
- Act as global lender of last resort for dollars

This backstop now implicitly limits how wide cross-currency basis can go — market knows Fed will intervene.

---

## Lessons

### For cross-currency basis

1. **Basis is a stress indicator** — widening precedes broader market stress
2. **Fed swap lines are the backstop** — limits tail risk for short basis positions
3. **EM basis moves faster/further** — less swap line access, thinner markets
4. **Corporate hedging costs spike in crises** — timing matters

### For portfolio construction

1. **Dollar funding risk is systemic** — affects all non-USD assets
2. **Liquidity can vanish simultaneously everywhere** — correlations go to 1
3. **Central bank intervention is the circuit breaker** — but timing uncertain

## EM-specific dynamics

### Brazil

[[Banco Central do Brasil]] accessed Fed swap line:
- Provided USD liquidity to domestic market
- Supplemented existing [[Cupom cambial|swap cambial]] program
- Helped stabilize BRL

### Broader EM

Countries without swap line access faced:
- Sharper currency depreciation
- Higher local funding costs
- Forced reserve sales

This reinforced importance of reserve adequacy and Fed relationship.
