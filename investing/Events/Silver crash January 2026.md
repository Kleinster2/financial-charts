**Silver crash January 2026** — January 31, 2026. Silver plunges 26% ($40/oz) in less than 20 hours — largest single-day drop on record. Gold falls 9% in worst day in over a decade. Trigger: [[Kevin Warsh]] Fed Chair nomination strengthens dollar; Chinese speculators take profits.

> **Key insight:** The crash exposed how options-driven momentum (gamma squeeze dynamics) can amplify both rallies and reversals. When dealers stopped buying to hedge call options, the same mechanics that pushed silver to $121 unwound violently.

## Charts

### Full rally and crash (2024-2026)

![[slv-gld-crash-2026.png]]

*SLV (silver) rose +380% before crashing to +225%. GLD (gold) peaked at +165% before falling to +125%. The parabolic rally in silver far exceeded gold's gains, reflecting speculative excess in the smaller market.*

### Detail view (Oct 2025-Jan 2026)

![[slv-gld-crash-2026-detail.png]]

*From Oct 2025 base, SLV gained +150% before crashing to +80% — a ~45% peak-to-trough decline. GLD fell from +40% to +23% — roughly 12% peak-to-trough.*

## The trigger

[[Kevin Warsh]] nomination as Fed Chair strengthened the dollar:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Warsh = Fed credibility | Dollar rallied on nomination news |
| Less dovish expectations | Long-duration Warsh = hawkish long-term |
| Safe haven unwind | Strong dollar reduces gold demand |

But the rally was already overstretched — the nomination was catalyst, not cause.

## Why it happened: [[Gamma squeeze]] mechanics

### The rally (Dec-Jan)

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Chinese retail buying | Physical demand + futures speculation |
| Record call option buying | Dealers hedged by buying underlying |
| CTA trend-following | Momentum algorithms piled in |
| Reflexive loop | Higher prices → more call buying → more dealer hedging → higher prices |

### The reversal

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Dollar rally trigger | Warsh news sparked profit-taking |
| Chinese sellers | "China sold and now we're suffering the consequences" |
| Gamma unwind | Dealers sell underlying as calls lose value |
| Same mechanics in reverse | Lower prices → call options worthless → dealers sell → lower prices |

---

## Options market extremes

### SLV (iShares Silver Trust)

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Friday turnover | $41B | More than Apple + Amazon combined |
| Call option volume | Exceeded QQQ | Silver ETF more active than Nasdaq 100 ETF |
| Call OI | Record | Set conditions for squeeze |

### GLD (SPDR Gold Shares)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Call OI | Record |
| Call volume | Record |

**The setup:** Heavy call option open interest creates squeeze conditions. When prices rise, dealers hedge by buying the underlying (pushing prices higher). When prices fall, they sell (pushing prices lower).

## Market structure observations

### Silver's vulnerability

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Market size | Annual supply ~$98B at current prices |
| vs Gold | Gold market ~$787B annually |
| Implication | Smaller market = larger price swings from same capital flows |

### Reddit/retail participation

Posts showed 1,000%+ gains from silver call options during the rally. Retail options activity contributed to gamma dynamics.

## Industry reaction

| Source | Quote/observation |
|--------|-------------------|
| Dominik Sperzel, [[Heraeus Precious Metals]] | "In my career it's definitely the wildest that I have seen" |
| Nicky Shiels, [[MKS PAMP]] | January 2026 = "most volatile month in precious metals history" |
| Traders | "Parabolic," "frenzied," "untradeable" |
| [[Heraeus]] | Sold out weeks in advance; operating at max capacity |

### European retail

Physical gold/silver shops saw queues for hours. Reminiscent of 1979-1980 — the only comparable period for such dramatic price swings.

## Chinese intervention

Several Chinese banks announced fresh measures to curb retail gold accumulation products:

| Bank | Measure |
|------|---------|
| China Construction Bank | Raised minimum deposit amounts |
| ICBC | Implemented quota controls for Ruyi Gold Savings during holidays |
| Exchanges | Multiple steps to rein in speculation |

## What happens next

### Near-term

| Factor | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| Lunar New Year | Traditional buying season — may support prices |
| Shanghai open (Sunday evening NY time) | Key test of whether Chinese demand revives |
| Price limits | 16-19% daily limits on Shanghai silver contracts may extend adjustment |

### Shuibei (major bullion trading hub)

| Observation | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Silver tightness | Eased; more selling than buying over weekend |
| Panic selling | Not observed |
| Premium | Shuibei silver still trading above exchange contracts |
| Gold | "Relatively strong" with dip buyers before Lunar New Year |

## Comparison to historical crashes

| Event | Silver move | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Jan 31, 2026** | **-26%** | Gamma squeeze reversal |
| Hunt Brothers (March 1980) | -50% over 4 days | Margin requirement changes |
| 2011 selloff | -30% over weeks | Post-QE2 correction |

## Thesis implications

### For precious metals as safe haven

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Gold = stability" | "Such a move is not a symbol of stability" |
| Fundamental driver | Momentum/speculation dominant short-term |

### For gamma/options dynamics

| Lesson | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Squeeze both ways | Same mechanics that drive rallies can reverse |
| Dealer positioning | Heavy call OI creates fragility |
| Size matters | Silver's small market amplifies everything |

### For China watching

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Chinese buyers drove rally | [[China]] retail/institutional speculation can move global markets |
| Chinese sellers drove crash | Profit-taking in Asia triggered global unwind |
| Lunar New Year | Holiday patterns affect timing |
