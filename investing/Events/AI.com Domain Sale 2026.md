## AI.com product

An "agentic AI" personal assistant offering:

- Personal AI agent

Marszalek to FT: "If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years — [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime."

## The irony

This is the same [[Crypto.com]] that:
- Spent $700M renaming the Staples Center (2021)
- Ran Matt Damon "Fortune Favors the Brave" [[Super Bowl LX|Super Bowl]] ads (2022) — now widely mocked
- Survived the 2022 crypto crash that killed [[FTX]], Celsius, Voyager, and others
- Is now pivoting from crypto branding to AI branding with the same playbook: buy the category domain, buy the Super Bowl ad

See [[Crypto Super Bowl 2022]] for the full cautionary tale. Whether AI.com becomes the next Crypto.com Arena (brand-defining) or the next "Fortune Favors the Brave" (mocked) depends on whether the product delivers.
