**Learning Resources v. Trump**, 607 U.S. ___ (2026) — Landmark Supreme Court decision striking down President Trump's sweeping tariffs imposed under IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act). In a **6-3 ruling** on February 20, 2026, the Court held that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. The most significant check on presidential trade power in modern history, and the biggest single-day policy shift for markets since the tariffs were imposed.

| Tariff | Target | Rate | Status |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **Fentanyl/border tariffs** | China | 10% on all imports | ❌ Struck down |

| **Fentanyl/border tariffs** | Canada | 35% on non-USMCA | ❌ Struck down |
| **"Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs** | Nearly all trading partners | 10-50% | ❌ Struck down |
| **De minimis exemption removal** | All countries | Ended duty-free <$800 packages | ❌ Struck down |

## What REMAINS in place

Tariffs imposed under **other legal authorities** were NOT affected:

| Tariff | Authority | Products |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Section 232** (Trade Expansion Act 1962) | National security | Steel, aluminum, autos, heavy trucks, copper, lumber, kitchen cabinets — worldwide |
| **Section 301** (Trade Act 1974) | Unfair trade practices | Various Chinese goods (Biden-era + Trump additions) |
| **Existing trade law tariffs** | Various | Pre-IEEPA tariffs on specific products |

The Section 232 tariffs on **steel, aluminum, and autos** are the most significant survivors.

## The legal reasoning

**Roberts (majority):** *"Based on two words separated by 16 others in IEEPA—'regulate' and 'importation'—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such weight."*

Key points:
- IEEPA "contains no reference to tariffs or duties"
- No president had ever read IEEPA as conferring tariff power until Trump
- **Major questions doctrine** applied — delegating "the core congressional power of the purse" requires clear congressional authorization, not ambiguous language
- Same doctrine used to strike down Biden's student loan forgiveness (2023)

**Kavanaugh (dissent, 63 pages):** Warned of "billions of dollars" in refunds and uncertainty over trade deals "worth trillions" negotiated using IEEPA tariffs as leverage, including deals with China, UK, Japan.

**Thomas (separate dissent):** Tariffs consistent with separation of powers "as an original matter."

## Market impact (Feb 20, 2026)

### Immediate reaction
| Market | Move |
|--------|------|
| S&P 500 | +0.6% |
| Nasdaq | +1.0% (led indices) |
| European autos | Rallied |
| Dollar index | -0.2% |
| 10-year Treasury yield | +2 bps to 4.096% (deficit concerns) |

### Biggest stock winners

**E-commerce / importers** (most directly impacted by de minimis removal + reciprocal tariffs):
| Stock | Move | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Etsy** | +8% | Small sellers crushed by de minimis removal |
| **eBay** | +3% | Marketplace sellers hurt by import costs |
| **Amazon** | +2% | Massive importer, third-party sellers |
| **Wayfair** | +2% | Furniture/home goods heavily imported |
| **PDD/Temu** | +2% | Entire US model built on de minimis loophole |
| **Shopify** | +1% | Merchant base reliant on imports |

**Broad beneficiaries:**
- Consumer discretionary / retail — anyone importing goods
- Industrial importers — manufacturers sourcing parts abroad
- European automakers — tariffs on EU cars eliminated
- Emerging market equities — reduced trade war risk

### The refund bomb
$150-200B in tariffs already paid may need to be refunded. This is:
- A **windfall for importers** (but unclear how much passed through to consumers)
- A **deficit bomb** — government loses both future revenue AND must refund past collections
- Bond yields rose (not fell) on the ruling — markets pricing in higher deficits
- Kavanaugh: refund process "could be difficult"

Remanded to US Court of International Trade to sort out refund mechanics.

## What happens next

### Trump's response
- **JD Vance:** Called it *"lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple"* — pointed to "wide range of other tariff powers"
- **Trump:** Announced plans for workarounds using other tariff authorities
- Administration expected to attempt reimposing tariffs via **Section 301, Section 232, Section 122, or Section 338** — all face their own legal and procedural constraints

### Cato Institute warning
*"Don't pop the champagne yet"* — unfettered use of Sections 122 and 338, along with Sections 301 and 232, "could essentially recreate the IEEPA predicament." Congress has delegated broad tariff powers under multiple statutes; IEEPA was just the broadest.

### Key upcoming events
- **April 2026:** Trump-Xi summit — tariffs were Trump's main negotiating leverage
- **Court of International Trade:** Refund proceedings begin
- **Congressional response:** Congress could pass new legislation explicitly granting (or denying) tariff authority
- **Market uncertainty:** Rick Meckler (Cherry Lane Investments): *"The confusion it's going to lead to is probably going to keep this market going back and forth over the next couple of days"*

## The refund bomb

### Scale
- **Penn Wharton Budget Model:** Up to **$175B** in refunds projected
- **Reuters:** $150-200B range
- **Tax Foundation:** At least $160B collected under IEEPA through Feb 20, 2026
- **CBP reported** $133.5B collected through December 14, 2025 (last public update before ruling)
- IEEPA tariffs represented **~50% of all US customs duties** at the time of the ruling

### Who collected what (by trading partner)
IEEPA tariffs began with China (Feb 2025), expanded to Canada/Mexico (March 2025), then went global with "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs (April 2025). China was the largest source of IEEPA revenue, followed by the EU, Canada, and Mexico.

### Refund mechanics
1. **Importers** are the legal payees — they paid the tariffs to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
2. Importers generally have **180 days after goods are "liquidated"** to protest and request refunds from CBP
3. Many entries are **not yet liquidated** — so the refund window is still open for most importers
4. CBP began issuing refunds electronically via ACH as of February 6, 2026
5. Case **remanded to US Court of International Trade** to work out refund procedures

### The complications
- **Passed-through costs:** Many importers already raised prices, passing tariff costs to consumers. Do they keep the refund AND the higher prices? Kavanaugh flagged this: *"some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others"*
- **Bankrupt businesses:** Some small businesses went under because of tariff costs. Refunds can't resurrect them.
- **Supply chain restructuring:** Companies that spent billions relocating supply chains (e.g., Temu building US logistics, manufacturers moving out of China) can't un-restructure
- **Trade deal uncertainty:** Deals negotiated using IEEPA tariffs as leverage (China, UK, Japan) are now legally ambiguous — were concessions given for tariffs that were illegal?
- **Timeline:** Could take **years** of litigation. Class action-style proceedings likely.
- **Deficit impact:** Government loses IEEPA revenue (~50% of customs duties) AND must refund past collections. Penn Wharton: future tariff revenue collections will **"fall by half"** unless replaced. Bond market already pricing this in (yields rose on the ruling).

### Who benefits most from refunds
| Beneficiary | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Large importers** (Amazon, Walmart, Target) | Biggest volumes, most tariffs paid, best legal teams to file claims |
| **Auto importers** | IEEPA reciprocal tariffs hit European/Japanese cars hard |
| **Electronics importers** | China tariffs hit consumer electronics |
| **Small businesses on Etsy/eBay/Shopify** | De minimis removal devastated them — but many already closed |
| **Temu/Shein** | Built entire US model on de minimis; refund of tariffs paid since removal |

### Who gets hurt
| Loser | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **US Treasury** | $175B outflow + lost future revenue |
| **Domestic producers** | Tariff protection removed — foreign competition returns |
| **Workers in protected industries** | Jobs created by tariff protection may disappear |
| **Bond holders** | Higher deficits → higher yields → lower bond prices |
| **Trump's negotiating leverage** | Tariffs were the main card for trade deals; now invalidated |

## Historical significance

This is the most significant judicial check on presidential trade power since the founding era. The Constitution gives Congress (not the president) the power to impose tariffs (Article I, Section 8). Over the 20th century, Congress gradually delegated trade authority to the executive through various statutes. *Learning Resources v. Trump* draws a line: emergency powers don't include tariffs.

Combined with the **major questions doctrine**, this ruling limits the president's ability to use vague statutory language to claim vast economic powers — the same principle that struck down Biden's student loan forgiveness. The conservative legal movement's favorite doctrine is now being used against a conservative president.
