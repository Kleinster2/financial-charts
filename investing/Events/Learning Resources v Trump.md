**Learning Resources v. Trump**, 607 U.S. ___ (2026) — Landmark Supreme Court decision striking down President Trump's sweeping tariffs imposed under IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act). In a **6-3 ruling** on February 20, 2026, the Court held that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. The most significant check on presidential trade power in modern history, and the biggest single-day policy shift for markets since the tariffs were imposed.

## What was struck down

All tariffs imposed under IEEPA — the first time the 1977 emergency law was used for tariffs:

| Tariff | Target | Rate | Status |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **Fentanyl/border tariffs** | China | 10% on all imports | ❌ Struck down |
| **Fentanyl/border tariffs** | Mexico | 25% on non-USMCA | ❌ Struck down |
| **Fentanyl/border tariffs** | Canada | 35% on non-USMCA | ❌ Struck down |
| **"Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs** | Nearly all trading partners | 10-50% | ❌ Struck down |
| **De minimis exemption removal** | All countries | Ended duty-free <$800 packages | ❌ Struck down |
| **Russian oil tariffs** (on India) | India | Various | ❌ Struck down |
| **Brazil tariffs** | Brazil | Various | ❌ Struck down |

---

## What REMAINS in place

Tariffs imposed under **other legal authorities** were NOT affected:

| Tariff | Authority | Products |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Section 232** (Trade Expansion Act 1962) | National security | Steel, aluminum, autos, heavy trucks, copper, lumber, kitchen cabinets — worldwide |
| **Section 301** (Trade Act 1974) | Unfair trade practices | Various Chinese goods (Biden-era + Trump additions) |
| **Existing trade law tariffs** | Various | Pre-IEEPA tariffs on specific products |

The Section 232 tariffs on **steel, aluminum, and autos** are the most significant survivors.

---

## The legal reasoning

**Roberts (majority):** *"Based on two words separated by 16 others in IEEPA—'regulate' and 'importation'—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such weight."*

Key points:
- IEEPA "contains no reference to tariffs or duties"
- No president had ever read IEEPA as conferring tariff power until Trump
- **Major questions doctrine** applied — delegating "the core congressional power of the purse" requires clear congressional authorization, not ambiguous language
- Same doctrine used to strike down Biden's student loan forgiveness (2023)

**Kavanaugh (dissent, 63 pages):** Warned of "billions of dollars" in refunds and uncertainty over trade deals "worth trillions" negotiated using IEEPA tariffs as leverage, including deals with China, UK, Japan.

**Thomas (separate dissent):** Tariffs consistent with separation of powers "as an original matter."

## Market impact (Feb 20, 2026)

### Immediate reaction
| Market | Move |
|--------|------|
| S&P 500 | +0.6% |
| Nasdaq | +1.0% (led indices) |
| European autos | Rallied |
| Dollar index | -0.2% |
| 10-year Treasury yield | +2 bps to 4.096% (deficit concerns) |

### Biggest stock winners

**E-commerce / importers** (most directly impacted by de minimis removal + reciprocal tariffs):
| Stock | Move | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Etsy** | +8% | Small sellers crushed by de minimis removal |
| **eBay** | +3% | Marketplace sellers hurt by import costs |
| **Amazon** | +2% | Massive importer, third-party sellers |
| **Wayfair** | +2% | Furniture/home goods heavily imported |
| **PDD/Temu** | +2% | Entire US model built on de minimis loophole |
| **Shopify** | +1% | Merchant base reliant on imports |

**Broad beneficiaries:**
- Consumer discretionary / retail — anyone importing goods
- Industrial importers — manufacturers sourcing parts abroad
- European automakers — tariffs on EU cars eliminated
- Emerging market equities — reduced trade war risk

### The refund bomb
$150-200B in tariffs already paid may need to be refunded. This is:
- A **windfall for importers** (but unclear how much passed through to consumers)
- A **deficit bomb** — government loses both future revenue AND must refund past collections
- Bond yields rose (not fell) on the ruling — markets pricing in higher deficits
- Kavanaugh: refund process "could be difficult"

Remanded to US Court of International Trade to sort out refund mechanics.

## What happens next

### Trump's response
- **JD Vance:** Called it *"lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple"* — pointed to "wide range of other tariff powers"
- **Trump:** Announced plans for workarounds using other tariff authorities
- Administration expected to attempt reimposing tariffs via **Section 301, Section 232, Section 122, or Section 338** — all face their own legal and procedural constraints

### Cato Institute warning
*"Don't pop the champagne yet"* — unfettered use of Sections 122 and 338, along with Sections 301 and 232, "could essentially recreate the IEEPA predicament." Congress has delegated broad tariff powers under multiple statutes; IEEPA was just the broadest.

### Key upcoming events
- **April 2026:** Trump-Xi summit — tariffs were Trump's main negotiating leverage
- **Court of International Trade:** Refund proceedings begin
- **Congressional response:** Congress could pass new legislation explicitly granting (or denying) tariff authority
- **Market uncertainty:** Rick Meckler (Cherry Lane Investments): *"The confusion it's going to lead to is probably going to keep this market going back and forth over the next couple of days"*

---

## The refund bomb

### Scale
- **Penn Wharton Budget Model:** Up to **$175B** in refunds projected
- **Reuters:** $150-200B range
- **Tax Foundation:** At least $160B collected under IEEPA through Feb 20, 2026
- **CBP reported** $133.5B collected through December 14, 2025 (last public update before ruling)
- IEEPA tariffs represented **~50% of all US customs duties** at the time of the ruling

### Who collected what (by trading partner)
IEEPA tariffs began with China (Feb 2025), expanded to Canada/Mexico (March 2025), then went global with "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs (April 2025). China was the largest source of IEEPA revenue, followed by the EU, Canada, and Mexico.

### Refund mechanics
1. **Importers** are the legal payees — they paid the tariffs to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
2. Importers generally have **180 days after goods are "liquidated"** to protest and request refunds from CBP
3. Many entries are **not yet liquidated** — so the refund window is still open for most importers
4. CBP began issuing refunds electronically via ACH as of February 6, 2026
5. Case **remanded to US Court of International Trade** to work out refund procedures

### The complications
- **Passed-through costs:** Many importers already raised prices, passing tariff costs to consumers. Do they keep the refund AND the higher prices? Kavanaugh flagged this: *"some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others"*
- **Bankrupt businesses:** Some small businesses went under because of tariff costs. Refunds can't resurrect them.
- **Supply chain restructuring:** Companies that spent billions relocating supply chains (e.g., Temu building US logistics, manufacturers moving out of China) can't un-restructure
- **Trade deal uncertainty:** Deals negotiated using IEEPA tariffs as leverage (China, UK, Japan) are now legally ambiguous — were concessions given for tariffs that were illegal?
- **Timeline:** Could take **years** of litigation. Class action-style proceedings likely.
- **Deficit impact:** Government loses IEEPA revenue (~50% of customs duties) AND must refund past collections. Penn Wharton: future tariff revenue collections will **"fall by half"** unless replaced. Bond market already pricing this in (yields rose on the ruling).

### Who benefits most from refunds
| Beneficiary | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Large importers** (Amazon, Walmart, Target) | Biggest volumes, most tariffs paid, best legal teams to file claims |
| **Auto importers** | IEEPA reciprocal tariffs hit European/Japanese cars hard |
| **Electronics importers** | China tariffs hit consumer electronics |
| **Small businesses on Etsy/eBay/Shopify** | De minimis removal devastated them — but many already closed |
| **Temu/Shein** | Built entire US model on de minimis; refund of tariffs paid since removal |

### Who gets hurt
| Loser | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **US Treasury** | $175B outflow + lost future revenue |
| **Domestic producers** | Tariff protection removed — foreign competition returns |
| **Workers in protected industries** | Jobs created by tariff protection may disappear |
| **Bond holders** | Higher deficits → higher yields → lower bond prices |
| **Trump's negotiating leverage** | Tariffs were the main card for trade deals; now invalidated |

## Tariff exposure baskets — who benefits most from the ruling

### Published baskets
- **Goldman Sachs** (David Kostin, Feb 2025): compiled basket of stocks "most at risk" from IEEPA tariffs — heavy on retailers with high China import exposure. Full list behind paywall.
- **Morningstar** (April 2025): event study around Liberation Day — filtered for stocks with >5% abnormal decline AND "direct first-order" tariff impact. Sectors: autos/parts, apparel, cyclical retail, defensive retail, medical devices, industrial distribution. Full list behind paywall.

### Liberation Day revealed basket (April 3, 2025)
The real-world stress test — stocks that got hammered hardest when tariffs were announced. These are the names with most to gain from the SCOTUS ruling:

| Stock | Ticker | Liberation Day drop | Sector | Tariff exposure |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Best Buy** | BBY | -18% | Electronics retail | Heavy China imports (TVs, appliances, components) |
| **Nike** | NKE | -14% | Apparel/footwear | ~50% manufactured in China/Vietnam |
| **Dollar Tree** | DLTR | -13% | Discount retail | Majority of goods China-sourced |
| **Target** | TGT | -11% | General retail | Large private-label import program |
| **Five Below** | FIVE | -10%+ | Discount | Nearly all products China-sourced |
| **Deckers (UGG/Hoka)** | DECK | -10%+ | Footwear | Asia manufacturing |
| **Ralph Lauren** | RL | -10%+ | Apparel | Global supply chain, China/Vietnam |
| **Urban Outfitters** | URBN | -9% | Apparel | Asia imports |
| **Skechers** | SKX | -9% | Footwear | China/Vietnam manufacturing |
| **Crocs** | CROX | -9% | Footwear | Vietnam/China |
| **VF Corp (North Face, Vans)** | VFC | -8% | Apparel | Global sourcing |
| **Williams-Sonoma (Pottery Barn)** | WSM | -8% | Home furnishings | Asia imports |

![[liberation-day-basket-vs-spy-price-chart.png]]
*Liberation Day basket vs SPY, normalized from April 1, 2025. FIVE and DLTR are the standout recoveries — both discount retailers benefited from the trade-down effect even as tariffs compressed margins. BBY and CROX remain underwater vs pre-Liberation levels. The Feb 20 ruling produced muted moves (biggest: CROX +3.7%, RL +2.2%) — JPM's 64% "immediately replaced" probability capped upside. SKX (Skechers) excluded — delisted/taken private.*

#### Performance data (Apr 1, 2025 → Feb 20, 2026)

| Ticker | Pre-Liberation | Post-Liberation | Liberation Day | Ruling day | Since Liberation |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **SPY** | $557.05 | $534.97 | -4.0% | +0.7% | +24.0% |
| **FIVE** | $76.43 | $58.80 | -23.1% | +1.9% | +187.8% |
| **DLTR** | $71.39 | $62.41 | -12.6% | +0.9% | +74.8% |
| **RL** | $247.37 | $217.03 | -12.3% | +2.2% | +72.7% |
| **DECK** | $138.11 | $122.13 | -11.6% | +1.3% | +28.1% |
| **WSM** | $174.30 | $153.16 | -12.1% | +1.9% | +23.3% |
| **TGT** | $113.05 | $100.38 | -11.2% | +0.1% | +22.7% |
| **URBN** | $62.52 | $56.42 | -9.8% | -0.5% | +9.3% |
| **NKE** | $63.64 | $54.54 | -14.3% | +0.3% | +5.3% |
| **VFC** | $22.09 | $16.02 | -27.5% | +2.0% | -3.9% |
| **CROX** | $109.07 | $95.29 | -12.6% | +3.7% | -8.3% |
| **BBY** | $75.43 | $62.71 | -16.9% | -2.7% | -11.6% |

*Sorted by total return since Liberation Day. FIVE's +188% reflects both tariff sensitivity and a secular re-rating of the discount model during the trade-down cycle. BBY's continued underperformance (-11.6%) suggests the market sees Section 301 tariffs on Chinese electronics as the binding constraint, not IEEPA.*

### E-commerce / de minimis beneficiaries (ruling day movers)
Stocks that rallied on the ruling day (Feb 20, 2026) because de minimis exemption removal was struck down:

| Stock | Ticker | Feb 20 move | Why |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Etsy** | ETSY | +8% | Small sellers devastated by de minimis removal |
| **eBay** | EBAY | +3% | Marketplace sellers, import costs |
| **Amazon** | AMZN | +2% | Massive importer, third-party seller ecosystem |
| **Wayfair** | W | +2% | Furniture/home goods heavily imported |
| **PDD (Temu)** | PDD | +2% | Entire US model built on de minimis loophole |
| **Shopify** | SHOP | +1% | Merchant base reliant on imports |

![[scotus-ruling-day-basket-vs-spy-price-chart.png]]
*SCOTUS ruling day movers vs SPY, normalized from April 1, 2025. Wayfair (+155%) dominates — a dual beneficiary of tariff relief and housing recovery. EBAY (+33%) and SHOP (+29%) beat SPY. PDD (-14%) is the only name still underwater since pre-Liberation, reflecting permanent China decoupling damage that the ruling can't fix.*

#### Performance data (Apr 1, 2025 → Feb 20, 2026)

| Ticker | Pre-Liberation | Post-Liberation | Liberation Day | Ruling day | Since Liberation |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **SPY** | $556.13 | $533.64 | -4.0% | +0.7% | +24.0% |
| **W** | $31.94 | $25.09 | -21.4% | +2.3% | +154.9% |
| **EBAY** | $66.10 | $65.66 | -0.7% | +3.9% | +33.2% |
| **SHOP** | $97.64 | $82.29 | -15.7% | +1.9% | +29.3% |
| **ETSY** | $46.92 | $48.41 | +3.2% | +8.4% | +11.2% |
| **AMZN** | $201.36 | $178.41 | -11.4% | +2.6% | +4.3% |
| **PDD** | $122.19 | $113.67 | -7.0% | +2.9% | -14.1% |

*Sorted by total return since Liberation Day. ETSY actually rallied on Liberation Day (+3.2%) — the market initially saw tariffs as a net positive for domestic marketplace sellers. AMZN (+4.3%) has badly lagged SPY (+24.0%) since — its China-sourced third-party seller exposure weighs more than the de minimis relief helps.*

### Two baskets, two stories

These are distinct groups with surprisingly little overlap. The **Liberation Day basket** (physical importers — retailers, footwear, apparel) identifies who was most *exposed* to IEEPA tariffs. The **ruling day basket** (e-commerce platforms) identifies who had the most *remaining upside* at the moment of the decision.

The key finding: **Liberation Day losers barely moved on ruling day.** BBY was actually *down* 2.7% on Feb 20. The market had already repriced physical importers over the prior 10 months — many recovered substantially as supply chains adjusted. The ruling day winners were e-commerce names where the de minimis reversal was a more binary surprise.

This divergence reflects JPM's 64% "immediately replaced" scenario. Physical importers face replacement tariffs under Section 232/301 regardless. E-commerce platforms — especially those built on the de minimis loophole (PDD/Temu, ETSY sellers, Shopify merchants) — got a cleaner win, since de minimis is harder to replicate under other statutory authorities.

### Companies that sued the government
These companies had the strongest conviction that tariffs were illegal — and now may be first in line for refunds:

| Company | Ticker | Sector |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Costco** | COST | Retail (wholesale) |
| **EssilorLuxottica** (Ray-Ban) | ESLX.PA | Eyewear |
| **Yokohama Tire** | 5101.T | Auto parts |
| **Kawasaki Motors** | 7012.T | Motorcycles/industrial |
| **Bumble Bee Foods** | Private | Food (canned seafood) |
| **Revlon** | Private | Cosmetics |

### Sectors with most relief potential

| Sector | Why | Key names |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Discount retail** | Near-100% import dependence on China | FIVE, DLTR, DG |
| **Footwear** | Asia manufacturing dominance | NKE, SKX, CROX, DECK |
| **Apparel** | China/Vietnam sourcing | VFC, RL, URBN, GPS |
| **Consumer electronics** | Component and finished goods imports | BBY, AAPL (partial) |
| **Home furnishings** | Asia manufacturing | WSM, W, RH |
| **Autos (European/Japanese)** | Reciprocal tariffs on imports | BMW, Toyota, VW |
| **E-commerce platforms** | De minimis + marketplace sellers | ETSY, EBAY, AMZN, SHOP |
| **Medical devices** | Specialized imported components | Various |

**Note:** Section 232 tariffs (steel, aluminum, autos) REMAIN — so auto-related relief is partial. European/Japanese automakers still face Section 232 duties even with IEEPA tariffs gone.

## Historical significance

This is the most significant judicial check on presidential trade power since the founding era. The Constitution gives Congress (not the president) the power to impose tariffs (Article I, Section 8). Over the 20th century, Congress gradually delegated trade authority to the executive through various statutes. *Learning Resources v. Trump* draws a line: emergency powers don't include tariffs.

Combined with the **major questions doctrine**, this ruling limits the president's ability to use vague statutory language to claim vast economic powers — the same principle that struck down Biden's student loan forgiveness. The conservative legal movement's favorite doctrine is now being used against a conservative president.
