# Jan-Feb 2026 sector drawdowns

Two successive waves of sector-specific drawdowns beneath a flat-to-up broad market. January hit 460 stocks (7%+ drawdowns) while SPY gained +1.5%. February hit 202 stocks while SPY fell just -1.5%. Different sectors led each wave, but some groups (gaming, fintech, SaaS) were hit in both — cumulative damage of -25% to -35% YTD while the index sits near flat.

## January wave — SaaS, quantum, fintech, managed care

460 stocks with 7%+ peak-to-close drawdowns in January. SPY barely dipped (-0.5% peak-to-close, +1.5% for the month). The "SaaSpocalypse" (Jan 27-31) was the main event — [[DeepSeek]] R1 launch triggered a repricing of AI-exposed SaaS and IT services stocks.

*January-led drawdown groups vs SPY. SaaS/AI Disruption and Quantum started falling mid-January; Fintech and Managed Care joined the rout in late January. All four groups then continued falling into February.*

| Group | Basket | Jan drawdown | YTD (Feb 13) | Constituents |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Quantum Computing | DDQC | -27.5% avg | -28.0% | [[D-Wave Quantum\|QBTS]], [[Rigetti Computing\|RGTI]], [[IonQ\|IONQ]], [[Arqit Quantum\|ARQQ]] |
| SaaS/AI Disruption | AIWD | -23.7% avg | -20.0% | [[Intuit\|INTU]], [[ServiceNow\|NOW]], [[Salesforce\|CRM]], [[LegalZoom\|LZ]], [[Thomson Reuters\|TRI]], [[RELX]], +6 more |
| Fintech | DDFT | -20.4% avg | -27.9% | [[Affirm\|AFRM]], [[Klarna\|KLAR]], [[Coinbase\|COIN]], [[Upstart\|UPST]], [[SoFi\|SOFI]], [[LendingClub\|LC]], [[Robinhood\|HOOD]], [[Block\|XYZ]], [[PayPal\|PYPL]] |
| Managed Care | DDMC | -15.9% avg | -14.7% | [[Humana\|HUM]], [[UnitedHealth\|UNH]], [[Elevance Health\|ELV]], [[Centene\|CNC]], [[Molina Healthcare\|MOH]] |

January catalysts:
- [[DeepSeek]] R1 launch (Jan 20) — repriced AI moats for SaaS/cloud incumbents
- Quantum hype unwinding — [[NVIDIA]] Jensen Huang "15-20 years away" comments
- [[Bitcoin]] decline from $100K+ to $80K range — dragged fintech/crypto
- [[Humana]] Medicare Advantage enrollment miss — managed care sold off on membership fears

## February wave — nuclear, space/defense, gaming, financials

### Catalyst

Multiple overlapping shocks:
- January 2026 CPI release (Feb 13) — 2.4% headline / 2.5% core (below consensus) but market sold off anyway on methodology concerns ([[BLS]] carry-forward from shutdown)
- Tariff escalation fears — reciprocal tariff framework uncertainty
- Earnings misses in high-beta sectors ([[DraftKings]], [[Coinbase]], [[Flutter Entertainment]])
- Nuclear/space momentum unwind — sectors that rallied 20-30% in January gave it all back

## February sector drawdowns vs SPY

## YTD context

![[sector-drawdowns-vs-spy-ytd-feb2026.png]]

*YTD view reveals the pattern: Space/Defense and Nuclear were January's biggest winners (+22-30% at peak), then gave it all back. Classic momentum unwind — the groups that ran hardest got hit hardest. Gaming was already weak YTD and kept falling. Financials and IT Services were roughly flat before the shock.*

## Combined YTD view — all drawdown groups

![[jan-feb-2026-drawdown-baskets-vs-spy.png]]

*All eight drawdown baskets vs SPY, YTD. SPY is roughly flat while every thematic group is -7% to -28%. The worst damage is in Quantum (-28%), Fintech (-28%), and SaaS (-20%) — all hit in January and never recovered. Nuclear rallied +30% in January before giving it all back in February. The broad market masked severe rotational damage underneath.*
