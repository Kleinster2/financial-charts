# Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026

[[Altruist]] launched AI-powered tax planning in its Hazel platform on February 10, 2026 — the tool reads 1040s, paystubs, account statements, meeting notes, and CRM data to generate personalized tax strategies in minutes. Wealth management and brokerage stocks sold off immediately. Third [[AI disintermediation]] shock in eight days, following the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] (Feb 3-8) and the [[Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026|Insurify selloff]] (Feb 9).

## What Altruist launched

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Product | Hazel AI tax planning (within existing Hazel platform) |
| Function | Reads 1040s, paystubs, statements, meeting notes, emails, CRM data → generates personalized tax strategies with scenario modeling |
| Time | Minutes (vs. hours/days for manual tax planning) |
| Pricing | $60/seat/month or $600/seat/year (standalone) |
| Adoption | 1,000+ wealth managers already on Hazel since Sep 2025 launch |
| Availability | Any advisory firm, regardless of custodian |

The threat isn't Hazel replacing advisors — it's Hazel making a $60/month tool do what firms charge $5,000-$25,000 per client for. Tax planning is one of the highest-value advisory services, and Altruist just commoditized it.

## Market impact: Feb 10, 2026

### Wealth management stocks YTD

![[schw-vs-rjf-vs-lpla-vs-sf-price-chart.png]]

*All four wealth managers dropped sharply on Feb 10. SCHW and RJF had been holding up through the SaaSpocalypse week — this was the first direct hit to traditional advisory.*

### Disintermediation spectrum: advisory vs. execution

![[schw-vs-wtw-vs-hood-vs-ibkr-price-chart.png]]

*IBKR (+15% YTD) and SCHW held up through the SaaSpocalypse because they're execution platforms, not advisory middlemen. Today's Altruist catalyst hit SCHW (-8%) because Schwab has a large advisory/wealth management business. HOOD (-25% YTD) was already destroyed by the broader AI fear. WTW (-10% YTD) hit by the Insurify catalyst yesterday.*

### Stock moves (Feb 10)

| Company | Ticker | Move | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| [[Raymond James]] | RJF | -8.5% | Heavy advisory/wealth management exposure |
| [[LPL Financial]] | LPLA | -8.4% | Largest independent broker-dealer |
| [[Charles Schwab]] | SCHW | -8.1% | $9T+ AUM, large advisory business |
| [[Stifel Financial]] | SF | -7.2% | Mid-cap wealth management |

## Why this hit hard

1. Tax planning is high-margin advisory work — it's the service that justifies 1% AUM fees. If AI does it for $60/month, the fee compression thesis becomes concrete.

2. Cumulative narrative — this is shock #3 in 8 days. Investors are pattern-matching: SaaS middlemen (Feb 3), insurance middlemen (Feb 9), wealth management middlemen (Feb 10). The market is repricing every advisory/intermediation business model simultaneously.

3. Altruist is credible — $1.9B valuation, backed by [[GIC]], [[Salesforce]] Ventures, Baillie Gifford. 1,000+ advisors already on Hazel. This isn't a demo; it's a product with distribution.

4. Custody-agnostic — Hazel works for any advisory firm regardless of custodian. This means Schwab's and Fidelity's own RIA clients can use it to reduce the value they need from their custodian's advisory tools.

## Altruist's position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2013, by Jason Wenk |
| HQ | Los Angeles |
| Valuation | ~$1.9B (Series F, Apr 2025) |
| Total raised | $500M+ |
| Key investors | [[GIC]], [[Salesforce]] Ventures, Baillie Gifford, Vanguard, Iconiq Growth |
| Custodial market share | 6.25% (T3 survey, doubling YoY) |
| Revenue growth | 550% in 2023, triple-digit in 2024 |
| Advisors on Hazel | 1,000+ |

Altruist is both a custodian (competing with Schwab, [[Fidelity]], Pershing) and an AI platform (competing with everyone's advisory tools). The custodian business gives it proprietary data access; the AI platform monetizes that data.

| Scale | $611B, 164 stocks | S&P Insurance -3.9% | SCHW -8%, RJF -8.5%, LPLA -8.4% |
| AI function | Replace professional workflows | Replace comparison/shopping | Replace tax planning/advisory |
| Pattern | [[AI disintermediation]] | [[AI disintermediation]] | [[AI disintermediation]] |

## Bull case (advisory defense)

- Relationship is the product — high-net-worth clients pay for trust, not tax planning. The 1% fee buys behavioral coaching, estate planning, access.
- Schwab's moat is custody + NII — advisory is one segment. Net interest income (~40% of revenue) and $9T in custody assets don't change.
- Hazel is a tool for advisors, not against them — Altruist positions Hazel as making advisors better, not replacing them. 1,000+ advisors are paying customers.
- Tax planning requires CPA sign-off — AI can draft strategies but licensed professionals must approve and file.

## Bear case (disruption thesis)

- Fee compression accelerates — if AI handles tax planning, portfolio construction, and rebalancing, what justifies 1% AUM on $5M+ portfolios?
- Advisory firms need fewer people — one advisor with Hazel can serve 200+ clients vs. 75-100 without AI. Headcount reduction at advisory firms = fewer seats needed at custodians.
- Altruist is the wedge — custodian + AI platform is a powerful combination. If Altruist takes custody share from Schwab while also commoditizing advisory, it's a double threat.
- Generational shift — younger wealth inheritors may prefer AI-first advice over human advisors. $84T great wealth transfer meets AI-native generation.
