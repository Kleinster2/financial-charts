## Deal terms

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Price | $950M ($900M upfront + $50M milestones) |
| Currency | ~€808M |
| Target revenue | ~$300M (2024) |
| Expected close | H1 2026 |
| Financing | Existing liquidity |

## Strategic rationale

**For STMicro:**
- Jumps from #6 to #3 in MEMS rankings
- Strengthens automotive safety sensors
- Expands industrial sensor portfolio
- Accretive margins (NXP MEMS higher margin than ST average)

**For NXP:**
- Focus on core automotive/IoT (radar, V2X, secure elements)
- Monetize non-core asset
- Simplify portfolio

## MEMS market context

| Rank | Company | 2024 Revenue |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Bosch | ~$2B |
| 2 | Broadcom | — |
| 3 | **STMicro (post-deal)** | — |
| ... | | |
| 6 | STMicro (pre-deal) | — |
| 13 | NXP MEMS | ~$300M |

## Products included

- Automotive MEMS sensors (safety, airbags)
- Industrial sensors
- Accelerometers, gyroscopes
- Pressure sensors

---

## Implications

- European semiconductor consolidation continues
- STMicro becomes more formidable competitor to [[Infineon]]
- NXP sharpens focus on higher-value automotive silicon
- Regulatory approval needed (EU, likely smooth for intra-European deal)
