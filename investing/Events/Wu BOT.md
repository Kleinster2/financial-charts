Wu BOT (武BOT) — [[Unitree]]'s martial arts performance at the [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]]. H1 and H2 humanoid robots performed parkour, Drunken Fist, nunchaku, and trampoline backflips alongside child kung fu students from Henan Tagou Martial Arts School.

## Naming

"Wu BOT" = 武 (wǔ, "martial") + BOT. Follows 2025's "YangBOT" = 秧歌 (yāngge, folk dance) + BOT. Both names fuse a traditional Chinese art form with "robot."

## Robots

| Model | Height | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| H1 | — | Parkour, trampolines, group choreography |
| H2 | 1.8m | Sword routines (finale) |

## Martial arts vocabulary

- Drunken Fist (醉拳, zuìquán) — kung fu style imitating a drunk person's movements. Swaying, stumbling, unpredictable weight shifts. Harder for robots than standard choreography because the movements are deliberately off-center and fluid; demonstrates force control and dynamic balance in non-standard postures.
- Nunchaku (双截棍) — two short sticks connected by a chain or rope. Swinging them requires precise timing, grip modulation, and dynamic balance. Demonstrates fine motor control.
- Airflare — a breakdancing power move where the body rotates horizontally in the air, supported by alternating hand plants.

---

## Technical highlights

- Force control enabled precise strikes with swords and batons
- Dynamic balance supported trampoline jumps and 3-meter aerial flips
- Single-leg flips and Airflare grand spins (7.5 rotations)
- World's first high-speed cluster repositioning (max 4 m/s arbitrary repositioning)
- Significant upgrade from 2025's YangBOT — weapons, parkour, and combat choreography replaced folk dance

## Why it matters

The [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]] reaches ~80% of active televisions in [[China]]. The 2025 YangBOT performance made [[Unitree]] a household name and led to founder [[Wang Xingxing]] meeting President [[Xi Jinping]] at a tech symposium. Wu BOT raises the bar: the shift from synchronized dance to weapons handling and combat choreography demonstrates rapid year-over-year capability improvement in force control, dynamic balance, and multi-robot coordination.

Collaboration partner: Henan Tagou Martial Arts School (child kung fu performers alongside robots).
