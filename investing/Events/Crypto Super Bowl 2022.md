#event #crypto #advertising #media

Super Bowl LVI (Feb 13, 2022) became known as the "Crypto Super Bowl" — crypto companies spent a combined **$54 million** on ads during peak crypto mania. Nine months later, [[FTX]] collapsed. By the 2023 Super Bowl, crypto had "zero representation."

The event is now a case study in peak-cycle advertising, celebrity endorsement risk, and the destruction of retail investor trust.

## The ads

| Company | Celebrity | Ad concept | What happened next |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| [[FTX]] | Larry David | Dismissed inventions throughout history, implied skeptics of FTX were like skeptics of the wheel. "Don't miss out" | FTX bankrupt Nov 2022. SBF convicted of fraud. Larry David's skepticism in the ad was accidentally correct |
| [[Coinbase]] | None (QR code) | Bouncing QR code offered $15 in Bitcoin. So much traffic it crashed the app | Stock fell ~86% from 2021 peak. Survived the crash, recovered by 2025 |
| [[Crypto.com]] | LeBron James | LeBron talks to his younger self about not missing opportunities | Laid off 20% of staff. Platform survived but shrank significantly |
| [[Crypto.com]] | Matt Damon | "Fortune favors the brave" — compared crypto investing to space exploration | Became the most mocked crypto ad. Damon faced years of ridicule |
| [[eToro]] | None | Social investing platform pitch | Pulled back from US market |
| [[FTX]] | Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen | Celebrity couple endorsed FTX | Both named in class-action lawsuit. Lost reported $650M+ combined |

## Why it matters

**Peak indicator:** The Crypto Super Bowl is now shorthand for "when an industry buys Super Bowl ads, it's probably the top." Comparable to the dot-com Super Bowl ads of 2000 (Pets.com, E-Trade).

**Celebrity endorsement liability:** Brady, Damon, David, LeBron all faced lawsuits or reputational damage. SEC later tightened rules on crypto celebrity endorsements (Kim Kardashian fined $1.26M for promoting EthereumMax).

**Retail investor harm:** The ads specifically targeted mainstream audiences with FOMO messaging ("Don't miss out," "Fortune favors the brave") right before a ~75% market drawdown.

**Regulatory catalyst:** The spectacle of mass crypto advertising followed by mass losses accelerated SEC enforcement actions and Congressional hearings on crypto regulation.

## The irony

Larry David's FTX ad literally showed him being wrong about every great invention — the joke being that skeptics of FTX were like skeptics of the wheel. David was playing a character who was *wrong* to be skeptical. In reality, being skeptical of FTX was the only correct take. The ad aged into the greatest unintentional truth in advertising history.
