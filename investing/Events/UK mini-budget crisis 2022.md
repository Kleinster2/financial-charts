**UK mini-budget crisis (Sep 2022)** — Bond vigilantes forced UK policy reversal in days. £45B unfunded tax cuts triggered gilt crash, pension fund margin calls, BoE emergency intervention. Truss resigned after 45 days. Key precedent for Fed independence debates.

## The mini-budget

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Total tax cuts | **£45B** — largest since 1972 |
| Funded by | Nothing — entirely debt-financed |
| Income tax | 20% → 19% |
| Top rate abolished | 45% rate eliminated |
| Corporation tax | Reversed planned increase |
| National Insurance | Reversed recent increase |

**Fatal flaw:** No Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast. Markets had no independent analysis.

## Market reaction

### Gilt yields

| Tenor | Sep 20 | Sep 27 | Change |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 10-year | 3.2% | 4.5%+ | **+130bp** |
| 30-year | ~3.8% | ~5.0% | **+120bp in 3 days** |

**Context:** One of largest yield spikes ever seen in developed market sovereign debt.

### Sterling

| Date | GBP/USD |
|------|---------|
| Sep 22 | ~1.13 |
| Sep 26 | **1.03** (record low, near parity) |

## Pension fund crisis (LDI)

### What is LDI?

**Liability-Driven Investment** — pension funds use derivatives to hedge long-dated liabilities. Requires posting collateral (gilts) as yields move.

### The doom loop

```
Gilt yields spike
    → Pension funds face margin calls
    → Forced to sell gilts to raise cash
    → Selling pushes yields higher
    → More margin calls
    → More forced selling
    → Repeat
```

### Scale of crisis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pension fund asset losses (2022) | **£425B** (-24%) |
| Near-failure scenario | 90% of UK pension funds would have been "wiped out" without BoE intervention |
| Potential gilt yield without intervention | **7-8%** (vs 4.5% at intervention) |

**Kerrin Rosenberg (Cardano):** "If there was no intervention today, around 90% of UK pension funds would have run out of collateral."

## Bank of England intervention

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | Sep 28, 2022 |
| Program size | **£65B** authorized |
| Actual purchases | **£19.3B** (30% of allocation) |
| Duration | Sep 28 - Oct 14 (17 days) |
| Purpose | Restore market function, not suppress yields |

**Irony:** BoE was supposed to be *selling* gilts (QT) while Truss was announcing massive borrowing.

---

## Responsibility debate

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Mini-budget fiscal shock | ~50% |
| LDI forced selling | ~50% |
| Pre-existing LDI fragility | Underlying vulnerability |
| No OBR forecast | Removed credibility anchor |

**Research finding:** "LDI selling accounted for at least half of the fall in gilt prices during the crisis."

---

## Aftermath

### Political
- Truss: Shortest-serving PM in UK history (45 days)
- Kwarteng: Shortest-serving Chancellor since 1970
- Sunak: Reversed nearly all tax cuts

### Regulatory reforms
- Higher liquidity buffers for pension funds
- Tighter leverage limits on LDI strategies
- Stronger governance and oversight
- Stress testing requirements

## Lessons / precedent

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bond vigilantes are real** | Sovereign debt markets can force policy reversal in days |
| **Speed matters** | 3 days from announcement to emergency intervention |
| **Credibility is fragile** | No independent forecast (OBR) = no anchor for markets |
| **Leverage amplifies** | LDI turned policy shock into near-systemic crisis |
| **Central banks get dragged in** | BoE had to intervene despite conflicting with its own QT |
| **Political consequences** | Markets can end governments (45-day PM) |

### Theoretical framework

This crisis illustrates the [[Time consistency]] problem identified by [[Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward Prescott]]. The UK government's credibility — built over decades through institutional constraints (OBR forecasts, BoE independence) — was destroyed in hours by bypassing those constraints. Markets immediately priced in the loss of commitment mechanism.

### Why this matters

This is the modern template for how bond markets discipline fiscal policy:

1. **Government announces unfunded spending/tax cuts**
2. **Bond yields spike immediately** (no waiting for inflation)
3. **Leveraged players (pensions, hedge funds) face margin calls**
4. **Forced selling creates doom loop**
5. **Central bank must intervene** (even if contradicts policy)
6. **Government forced to reverse** or fall

Any country with large debt, leveraged financial system, and policy credibility questions faces this risk.
