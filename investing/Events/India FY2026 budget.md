## Charts

### Rupee under pressure

*Rupee has depreciated from 83 to 92 vs USD since Jan 2024 — accelerating in late 2025. RBI FX interventions to defend currency drain liquidity from the bond market.*

## Market impact

**10-year yield:** 6.73% (Jan 31, 2026), highest since March 2025. Could push to 7%.

**Supply pressure:**
- Record gross issuance
- Heavy state government borrowing
- ₹5.5T redemption wall (70% YoY increase)

**Demand weakness:**
- Pension funds shifting toward equities
- Slower premium growth curbing insurer purchases
- [[Reserve Bank of India]] FX interventions draining liquidity
- Limited room for further rate cuts

**State borrowing:** IDFC First Bank expects gross state borrowing to rise 7% to ₹13T in FY27, adding to supply pressure as states boost welfare spending ahead of elections.

## RBI response

Central bank has stepped up bond purchases to inject liquidity, but yields remain elevated despite 125bp of rate cuts in 2025.

**Expected OMO purchases (FY27):**

| Bank | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| DBS Bank | ₹3-4T |
| Nomura | ₹2.5T |

ANZ: "A disciplined central government fiscal stance is necessary but not sufficient to mitigate bond market stress. Increased central bank support will be necessary."

Next catalyst: RBI monetary policy statement Feb 6, 2026.

## Analyst reactions

**ICICI Securities (Abhishek Upadhyay):**
> Pace of fiscal consolidation is quite modest — government may be running out of space to curb spending.

**ICBC (Alok Sharma):**
> Active liquidity management will be required, or the path of least resistance is only upwards for yields.

**Mirae Asset (Basant Bafna):**
> Central government has remained prudent on fiscal consolidation, but state finances have been stretched. The trend is likely to continue.

**Bull case — ICICI Prudential AMC:**
> The fear around demand supply may be overstated. Major demand sources like banks, pension and insurance have the capacity and appetite to add government and state bond assets.

## Technical details

- **T-bill issuance:** Nomura expects ₹1T net T-bill issuance due to bank demand (replacing bonds given in RBI OMO auctions)
- **RBI bilateral switch:** RBI holds ₹700B of govt bonds maturing in FY27 (IDFC First estimate). Bilateral switch could reduce gross borrowing
- **GST Compensation Cess Fund:** Usage unclear — proceeds may be distributed between central/state govts, potentially funding deficit (QuantEco)
- **Future consolidation:** ICICI Bank expects pace to slow amid shift to targeting debt-to-GDP ratio
