**Delhi Declaration (2026)** — Non-binding multilateral declaration on AI signed by 75–80+ countries at the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]] on February 20, 2026. The fourth in a series of AI summit declarations (after Bletchley Park 2023, Seoul 2024, Paris 2025), and the one with the most signatories — surpassing the Paris Action Summit's ~60. Drafted under [[India]]'s presidency, it centers the idea that *"AI's promise is best realised only when its benefits are shared by humanity"* (per EU press release).

## Key principles (reported)

Full text not yet released at time of writing (due Feb 21). Based on reporting and government press releases:

- **Inclusive AI** — AI benefits must be shared across all of humanity, not concentrated in a few countries/companies
- **Human-centric governance** — aligned with Modi's "MANAV Vision" (MANAV = "human" in Hindi) framework unveiled at the summit
- **Frontier AI commitments** — voluntary commitments on sharing data about real-world AI usage and improving AI for underrepresented languages
- **No binding regulation** — consistent with US position rejecting global AI governance
- **Global South representation** — first AI declaration shaped primarily by a developing country

### What's notably absent (per TIME)
- No overt mention of previous summits' attempts to coordinate government action on **AI safety risks**
- No binding commitments on frontier AI risk mitigation
- Emphasis shifted from "AI safety" (Bletchley/Seoul framing) to "AI for development" (Delhi framing)

## Evolution of AI summit declarations

| Summit | Date | Location | Signatories | Focus |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Bletchley Park** | Nov 2023 | UK | 28 countries + EU | AI safety; existential risk; first global agreement on frontier AI risks |
| **Seoul** | May 2024 | South Korea | ~28 | AI safety commitments; voluntary testing; company pledges |
| **Paris Action Summit** | Feb 2025 | France | ~60 | Broader scope; "AI for humanity"; Global South inclusion; still safety-focused |
| **Delhi Declaration** | Feb 2026 | India | **75–80+** | **Inclusive development; human-centric; Global South-led; safety language diluted** |

**Trend:** Each successive summit has been larger in participation but weaker in safety-specific commitments. As the tent grows bigger, the language gets more general.

## Context and tensions

### US rejection of global governance
[[Sriram Krishnan]] (White House AI adviser) and Michael Kratsios stated at the summit that the US "totally rejects global governance of AI." This effectively caps what any declaration can achieve — the world's leading AI power won't accept binding rules.

### China's absence
China was "all but absent" from the summit (TIME), which fell during Chinese New Year. As the world's #2 AI power and India's strategic rival, China's non-participation limits the declaration's universality.

### Shift from safety to development
The Delhi Declaration reflects India's strategic reframing: AI summits started as UK/Seoul-driven conversations about **existential risk from frontier AI** and have evolved into broader discussions about **AI for development and inclusion**. India, as first Global South host, pushed this shift deliberately — positioning itself as voice of developing nations rather than safety regulator.

Chatham House's Isabella Wilkinson: *"Full global consensus on how to govern AI is a far cry from reality. The core issue is how to incentivize countries and companies to get around the same table despite fragmented geopolitics, intense competition, and the drive for ever-more powerful and profitable AI."*

### "New Delhi Frontier AI" pact (separate)
Also announced Feb 20 — a parallel voluntary commitment signed by [[Google]], [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Microsoft]], [[Meta]] + Indian firms [[Sarvam AI]], [[BharatGen]], [[Gnani AI]], [[Soket AI]]. This covers AI companies specifically (vs. the Delhi Declaration which is country-level).

## Significance

The Delhi Declaration matters less for what it says (non-binding, general language) and more for what it represents:

1. **Largest AI consensus ever** — 75–80+ countries vs 28 at Bletchley
2. **Global South ownership** — first AI declaration drafted by a developing country
3. **Normative shift** — from "AI safety" to "AI inclusion" as the organizing principle
4. **Platform for India** — positions India as broker between US and Global South on AI

But it also exposes the limits of multilateral AI governance: the more countries sign, the more vague the commitments become. With the US rejecting binding governance and China absent, the declaration is aspirational rather than actionable.

## Next summit

**Switzerland** to host the AI Summit 2027 in Geneva (announced by Swiss President Guy Parmelin at the Delhi summit).
