## Why Netflix walked away

[[Ted Sarandos]] had telegraphed discipline throughout: "We're super-disciplined buyers... willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things."

Netflix had 4 business days to match or raise after the "Superior Proposal" declaration. It immediately declined. The $2.8B breakup fee partially compensates the months of deal costs and strategic distraction.

Netflix stock rose on the news — the market read it as avoiding an overpriced acquisition. Netflix retains its $20B annual content budget and the option to pursue other studio assets.

## What Netflix would have gotten

- HBO/HBO Max — prestige content brand, ~117M subscribers
- Warner Bros studio — theatrical + TV production (one of "Big Five")
- Content library — DC, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, Sopranos
- DC Studios — superhero franchise
- Warner Bros Games, Tours, Retail
- Studio facilities — Burbank + Leavesden (UK)

---

## Regulatory and political dynamics

- DOJ Antitrust Division reviewing both bids
- [[EU]] authorities reviewing
- Senate Judiciary hearing Feb 3 — key question was market definition: SVOD-only (Netflix+HBO >30% share, presumption of illegality) vs. all TV viewing (~10%, easily defensible)
- [[YouTube]] as competitor was Netflix's core antitrust argument (~13% TV viewing share vs Netflix ~9%)
- Paramount's CLO is Makan Delrahim, former Trump DOJ Antitrust Division chief
- Trump bought $2M in NFLX/WBD bonds post-announcement

---

## Activist pressure

- [[Ancora Holdings]] (~$200M stake) — opposed Netflix bid, backed Paramount, planned proxy fight
- [[Pentwater Capital]] (~50M shares) — backed Paramount; CEO Matt Halbower eyed as potential WBD board nominee

## Why WBD isn't trading at $31 (Feb 27)

WBD closed ~$28.90 — a ~7% spread to the $31 deal price. The market isn't doubting the deal happens; it's pricing the risk and the wait.

**1. Shareholder vote (March 20):** Not a rubber stamp. Ancora Holdings and Pentwater Capital may still oppose. Proxy fights can delay or create noise even if they don't kill the deal.

**2. DOJ antitrust:** Combining two major studios (Warner Bros + Paramount) is significant horizontal content consolidation. Paramount cleared HSR second request, but full DOJ review is ongoing. Timeline uncertain — deal expected Q3-Q4 2026, that's 6-9 months of carry.

**3. The $7B reverse breakup fee tells you something:** Paramount committed a massive regulatory break fee. They wouldn't do that if antitrust clearance were a formality. The market reads this as real risk.

**4. Financing risk:** $111B all-cash deal. Paramount needs to finance this in credit markets that are tightening — IG spreads widening, private credit under stress. [[Larry Ellison]]'s $40B personal equity guarantee helps, but the debt portion still needs to get done.

**5. Time value of money:** Even if the deal closes at $31, capital is locked for 6-9 months. At current rates, ~7% annualized spread is roughly market-rate merger arb return — not a screaming discount, just fair compensation for the duration and risk.

Bottom line: the spread is pricing it about right for a deal with real regulatory/vote/financing hurdles and a long close timeline. It's not skepticism about *whether* — it's pricing the *when* and the *what if*.

## Open questions (as of Feb 27)

- Shareholder vote March 20 — will activists try to block or extract concessions?
- DOJ timeline — how long for full antitrust review of horizontal studio consolidation?
- Paramount financing execution in tightening credit markets
- What does Paramount do with [[Linear TV]] assets (CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery)?
- Will Netflix pursue alternative studio acquisitions with the HBO thesis still valid?
