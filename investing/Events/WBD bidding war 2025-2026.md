## Why Netflix walked away

[[Ted Sarandos]] had telegraphed discipline throughout: "We're super-disciplined buyers... willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things."

Netflix had 4 business days to match or raise after the "Superior Proposal" declaration. It immediately declined. The $2.8B breakup fee partially compensates the months of deal costs and strategic distraction.

Netflix stock rose on the news — the market read it as avoiding an overpriced acquisition. Netflix retains its $20B annual content budget and the option to pursue other studio assets.

---

## What Netflix would have gotten

- HBO/HBO Max — prestige content brand, ~117M subscribers
- Warner Bros studio — theatrical + TV production (one of "Big Five")
- Content library — DC, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, Sopranos
- DC Studios — superhero franchise
- Warner Bros Games, Tours, Retail
- Studio facilities — Burbank + Leavesden (UK)

---

## Regulatory and political dynamics

- DOJ Antitrust Division reviewing both bids
- [[EU]] authorities reviewing
- Senate Judiciary hearing Feb 3 — key question was market definition: SVOD-only (Netflix+HBO >30% share, presumption of illegality) vs. all TV viewing (~10%, easily defensible)
- [[YouTube]] as competitor was Netflix's core antitrust argument (~13% TV viewing share vs Netflix ~9%)
- Paramount's CLO is Makan Delrahim, former Trump DOJ Antitrust Division chief
- Trump bought $2M in NFLX/WBD bonds post-announcement

### The Trump factor

The political dimension of this deal cannot be separated from the outcome.

**Trump-Ellison axis:**
- David Ellison is Trump's "good friend" — attended Trump's State of the Union on Feb 24 (two days before WBD declared Superior Proposal)
- Ellison had declined to testify before the Senate subcommittee earlier in 2026, unlike Sarandos who showed up for a "MAGA roasting" on Feb 3
- Paramount-Skydance initially had backing interest from Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners (withdrew) and Gulf sovereign wealth funds (PIF, QIA, L'imad — may rejoin at close)

**Trump-Netflix hostility:**
- **Feb 21:** Trump on Truth Social: "Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences"
- Triggered by Laura Loomer, who called to "kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now" after Rice warned on a podcast that institutions that appease Trump will be held "accountable" when Democrats regain power
- Sarandos tried to play it down on BBC Radio (Feb 23): "This is a business deal. It's not a political deal... Yeah, he likes to do a lot of things on social media"

**The White House visit — "the fix was in":**

Sarandos went to the White House on Feb 26 for a "long scheduled" visit to discuss regulatory approval and the Susan Rice situation. He met with WH staff and DOJ officials — **not Trump**. A White House official confirmed: "This meeting is not with POTUS."

The timing was devastating. At 1:18 PM PT, *while Sarandos was sitting in meetings*, the WBD board issued the Superior Proposal declaration. Ninety minutes later, at ~2:45 PM PT, Netflix issued its walkaway statement. Deadline reported Sarandos signed off on the retreat while still at the White House — Netflix disputed this but wouldn't say what specifically was inaccurate.

An Oscar-winning producer told Deadline: "I don't know if it was pre-planned, but the timing was brutal. And so embarrassing for Ted, to be at the White House."

**Reading between the lines:** Sarandos went to DC to gauge his political standing and found out — either from the meetings themselves or from the news landing while he was there — that the political wind was blowing toward Ellison. He killed the deal within 90 minutes of the Superior Proposal. The speed of the decision (not using any of the 4-day matching window) suggests he either already knew he was walking, or learned something at the White House that made the path forward untenable.

### Congressional reaction (post-walkaway)

| Lawmaker | Position |
|----------|----------|
| **Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA)** | Paramount-WBD deal should be subject to "highest levels of scrutiny" and "free from White House political influence" |
| **Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)** | Called it an "antitrust disaster," questioned Trump influence |
| **Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)** | Calling for David Ellison to testify at March 4 Senate subcommittee hearing |
| **Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)** | Clearly "Team Paramount" along with other Republicans |

**March 4 Senate antitrust hearing** already scheduled — Booker wants Ellison to appear. This could be the next flashpoint.

## Activist pressure

- [[Ancora Holdings]] (~$200M stake) — opposed Netflix bid, backed Paramount, planned proxy fight
- [[Pentwater Capital]] (~50M shares) — backed Paramount; CEO Matt Halbower eyed as potential WBD board nominee

## Merger arb spread

![[wbd-spread-to-deal-price.png]]
*WBD premium/discount to best bid. Netflix $27.75 (Dec 5) → Paramount $30 (Feb 10, step-down) → Paramount $31 (Feb 24). Stock briefly traded at a premium to Netflix's bid in early Dec, then persistent 4-9% discount once Paramount's higher bids came in. Discount widened to -9.1% on day of formal announcement.*

Key observations:
- WBD briefly traded **above** Netflix's $27.75 in early Dec — market correctly anticipated a bidding war
- Settled at 1-3% premium to $27.75 through Jan — comfortable the Netflix deal would close
- **Feb 10 step-down:** Paramount's $30 resets the reference higher → instant -7% discount because the market sees more execution risk with a hostile all-of-WBD deal
- **Feb 24-27:** $31 bid → discount **widened** from -6% to -9.1% into the formal announcement. Not confidence.

## Why WBD isn't trading at $31 (Feb 27)

WBD closed ~$28.90 — a ~7% spread to the $31 deal price. The market isn't doubting the deal happens; it's pricing the risk and the wait.

**1. Shareholder vote (March 20):** Not a rubber stamp. Ancora Holdings and Pentwater Capital may still oppose. Proxy fights can delay or create noise even if they don't kill the deal.

**2. DOJ antitrust:** Combining two major studios (Warner Bros + Paramount) is significant horizontal content consolidation. Paramount cleared HSR second request, but full DOJ review is ongoing. Timeline uncertain — deal expected Q3-Q4 2026, that's 6-9 months of carry.

**3. The $7B reverse breakup fee tells you something:** Paramount committed a massive regulatory break fee. They wouldn't do that if antitrust clearance were a formality. The market reads this as real risk.

**4. Financing risk:** $110B deal requiring $39B in new debt + $15B bridge backstop from BofA/Citi/Apollo — in credit markets that are tightening (IG spreads widening, private credit under stress). The $47B equity commitment from Ellison/RedBird is solid, but $54B+ of debt still needs to get placed. The Kushner and Tencent withdrawals aren't confidence-inspiring.

**5. Time value of money:** Even if the deal closes at $31, capital is locked for 6-9 months. At current rates, ~7% annualized spread is roughly market-rate merger arb return — not a screaming discount, just fair compensation for the duration and risk.

Bottom line: the spread is pricing it about right for a deal with real regulatory/vote/financing hurdles and a long close timeline. It's not skepticism about *whether* — it's pricing the *when* and the *what if*.

## Open questions (as of Feb 27)

- Shareholder vote early spring — will activists try to block or extract concessions?
- Paramount conference call **Mon Mar 2, 8:30 AM ET** — watch for detail on financing terms, synergy timeline, integration plan
- DOJ timeline — how long for full antitrust review of horizontal studio consolidation?
- Paramount financing execution in tightening credit markets
- What does Paramount do with [[Linear TV]] assets (CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery)?
- Will Netflix pursue alternative studio acquisitions with the HBO thesis still valid?
