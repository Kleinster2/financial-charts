# 2026 State of the Union — economic claims fact-check

Trump's record-length 2026 SOTU included sweeping economic claims. Steve Rattner (Morning Joe economic analyst, former Treasury official) systematically debunked them with data.

## Inflation

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Inherited record inflation" | Inherited sub-3% (down from 9% peak under Biden) |
| "Inflation is plummeting" | CPI dipped slightly; PCE (Fed's preferred measure) actually **up** |
| Liberation Day tariffs visible | PCE uptick tracks post-tariff timeline |

Trump inherited the *tail end* of disinflation, not record inflation.

## GDP growth

| Period | Annual GDP growth |
|--------|------------------|
| Biden (last two years) | 2.4%, 3.4% |
| Trump Year 1 | 2.2% |

Drag from: tariff uncertainty, immigration cuts (labor force), Q4 government shutdown.

## Jobs

| Metric | Biden | Trump |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Monthly job growth (avg) | 122,000 | 15,000 |
| Unemployment trend | Declining | Rising |
| Long-term unemployed (26+ wks) | — | 25% of unemployed |
| Youth unemployment | — | ~10% |

## Manufacturing

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Factories pouring into the US" | Manufacturing construction spending **declining** |
| Record manufacturing growth | Manufacturing employment **down** since inauguration |

Biden-era [[CHIPS Act]] and [[IRA]] drove a manufacturing construction spike. Under Trump, no replacement legislation — spending and employment both falling. WSJ reporting extensively on the manufacturing jobs slump, attributing it partly to tariff effects.

## Tariffs replacing income tax

| Revenue source | Share of federal revenue |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Individual income tax | 51% (~$12T) |
| Custom duties (tariffs) | 4% |

Total US imports ≈ $12T — would need ~100% tariff on everything to replace income tax. Math doesn't work.

**Who pays?** NY Fed study: **86-94% absorbed by US importers**, only 6-14% by foreign exporters. Trump's chief economic advisor called it "the worst study he'd ever seen" — which Rattner took as a compliment.
