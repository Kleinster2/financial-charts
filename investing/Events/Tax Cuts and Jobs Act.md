# Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

Major US tax reform signed December 22, 2017. The largest overhaul of the US tax code since 1986.

---

## Key provisions

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Corporate tax rate | 35% | 21% |
| Repatriation tax | 35% on return | One-time 15.5% (cash) / 8% (illiquid) |
| Territorial system | Worldwide taxation | Exempts most foreign profits |

## Impact on corporate earnings

**One-time windfalls (2017-2018):**
- Companies booked massive deferred tax asset revaluations
- Repatriation holiday triggered profit recognition on overseas cash
- Some companies showed net income exceeding revenue (impossible from operations)

**Example — [[Broadcom]]:**
- Q1 FY18: Net income 117% of revenue
- Entirely from tax benefit recognition, not operating performance

**Ongoing benefit:**
- Permanent 14pp reduction in effective tax rate
- Boosted EPS across US corporates ~15-20%

## Repatriation wave

US multinationals held ~$2.6T overseas pre-TCJA. The one-time tax holiday triggered massive capital return:

**Tech (largest overseas hoards):**

| Company | Repatriated | Use |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| [[Apple]] | $252B | Buybacks, dividends |
| [[Microsoft]] | ~$130B | Buybacks, acquisitions |
| [[Cisco]] | $67B | Buybacks |
| [[Google]] (Alphabet) | ~$50B | Buybacks |
| [[Oracle]] | ~$35B | M&A spree |
| [[Qualcomm]] | ~$30B | Buybacks, attempted NXP deal |
| [[Broadcom]] | Large (undisclosed) | Acquisitions |

**Pharma:**

| Company | Repatriated | Use |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| [[Pfizer]] | $24B | M&A, buybacks |
| [[Johnson & Johnson]] | Large | Diversified deployment |
| [[Merck]] | Significant | M&A |
| [[Amgen]] | Significant | Buybacks |
| [[Gilead]] | Significant | Buybacks, dividends |

**Other:**

| Company | Repatriated | Use |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| [[General Electric]] | Large | Debt reduction (struggling) |

Apple's $252B was ~10% of the estimated $2.6T total brought back.
