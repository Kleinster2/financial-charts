## Energy

Largest IRA rollback. Reorients federal energy policy away from net-zero:

Renewable credits phased out:
- Wind/solar investment & production tax credits sunset after 2027 (loophole extends to 2030 for early-committed projects)
- Tech-neutral clean electricity credits (geothermal, batteries, nuclear) phase out starting 2032

Fossil fuel expansion:
- Mandated new oil & gas lease sales onshore/offshore
- Delinked from renewable lease requirements
- Restored pre-IRA royalty rates
- Full deduction for intangible drilling costs restored
- Methane emissions fee delayed to 2035
- Enhanced carbon capture credits (especially for enhanced oil recovery)

BNEF forecasts **23% less** renewable deployment by 2035.

## Social program cuts (~$1.4T)

### Medicaid (~$900B over 10 years)

- Work requirements: nondisabled adults 18-64 must work/train/volunteer 80 hrs/month
- Age expansion: work requirements now cover ages 55-64 (new)
- Eligibility checks increased to every 6 months (from annually) for expansion enrollees, effective Dec 31, 2026
- States must implement by Jan 1, 2027
- CBO: 10.9M lose health insurance coverage by 2034
- $325B of cuts from work requirements alone

### SNAP (~$187B over 10 years)

- Work requirement age expanded to cover 55-64 (new)
- States must contribute up to 15% of SNAP food benefit costs starting FY2028, based on payment error rates
- Limits on USDA's ability to update benefit levels

### Education

- Parent PLUS loans: $20,000/yr per child cap, $65,000 lifetime cap (eff. Jul 1, 2026)

## Bond market reaction

The fiscal expansion triggered a sustained bond selloff:

| Metric | Level |
|--------|-------|
| 10-year Treasury | >4.61% |
| 30-year Treasury | >5.14% (highest since Oct 2023) |
| Goldman forecast | 30Y could exceed 6%, 10Y above 5% |
| Deficit/GDP | >7% by 2026 |

The bill shifts fiscal risk higher by extending unfunded tax cuts while adding defense and immigration spending. The spending cuts ($1.4T) cover less than a third of the revenue loss ($4.5T).

## Sector implications

| Sector | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Defense/aerospace | +$150B, [[Golden Dome]] prime contractors benefit |
| Fossil fuels | Lease mandates, drilling deductions, methane fee delay |
| Renewables/solar | Negative — IRA credits phased out, 23% less deployment forecast |
| EVs | Negative — tax credits eliminated |
| Healthcare/hospitals | Negative — 10.9M coverage losses |
| Private prisons/detention | +$45B detention capacity |
| Housing/real estate | SALT relief ($40K cap) benefits high-tax state homeowners |
| Crypto | "Trump accounts" could create early investment vehicles |
| Homebuilders | SALT cap increase modestly positive for high-tax markets |
