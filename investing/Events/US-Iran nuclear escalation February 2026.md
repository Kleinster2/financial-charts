# US-Iran nuclear escalation February 2026

Rapid escalation between the US and [[Iran]] following failed Geneva nuclear talks. VP Vance declared Iran failed to meet US red lines; military strikes described as "on the table." [[Polymarket]] odds of a US strike at **67%**, with a March 31 window surging **+32%**.

## Military posture

### US force buildup

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) | Deployed to region |
| USS Gerald Ford (CVN-78) | En route |
| F-35 Lightning II | 50+ aircraft surge |
| F-22 Raptor | Part of surge deployment |
| F-16 Fighting Falcon | Part of surge deployment |

Two carrier strike groups is the standard posture for major operations (Iraq 2003 had five).

### Iran preparations

- Revolutionary Guard exercises in [[Strait of Hormuz]]
- Joint military exercises with [[Russia]] in Gulf of Oman
- Satellite imagery shows repair/fortification of underground nuclear sites
- Hardened bunker complexes designed to withstand conventional strikes

## Market impact (Feb 18, 2026)

### Commodities

| Asset | Move | Level |
|-------|------|-------|
| WTI crude | **+4.6%** | $65.19 |
| Brent crude | **+4.4%** | $70.35 |
| Gold | **+$61** | $4,957/oz |

Gold flirting with $5,000 psychological level. Oil spike reflects [[Strait of Hormuz]] closure risk (~20% of global oil transits).

### European defense (leading)

| Company | Move | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[Thales]] | **+5.9%** | Electronics, missile systems |
| [[Leonardo]] | **+5.4%** | Helicopters, electronics |
| [[Rheinmetall]] | **+5.0%** | Munitions, air defense |
| [[Saab]] | **+4.7%** | Fighters, missiles |
| [[BAE Systems]] | **+4.4%** | Full spectrum |
| Hensoldt | **+3.8%** | Sensors, radar |
| Safran | **+2.3%** | Engines, missiles |

### US large-cap defense (lagging)

| Company | Move | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[L3Harris]] | **+1.6%** | Communications, ISR |
| [[General Dynamics]] | **+1.3%** | Submarines, IT |
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | **+1.0%** | F-35, missiles |

### US small-cap defense (outperforming)

| Company | Move | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[Karman Holdings]] | **+5.1%** | Warheads, hypersonics, penetrators |
| [[Kratos Defense]] | **+5-9%** | Drones, hypersonic targets |

### Key observation: European > US primes

European defense stocks outperformed US primes **4-6x**. Two explanations:

1. **US primes already priced for conflict** — [[Trump defense budget]] expansion ($1.5T FY27) already baked in. Marginal Iran conflict impact is smaller.
2. **European names have more beta to geopolitical shock** — less priced for war, more room to re-rate on threat escalation.

US small-caps ([[Karman Holdings]], [[Kratos Defense]]) with direct hypersonic/missile/penetrator exposure outperformed large-cap primes, suggesting market is pricing specific capability needs (bunker busters, precision munitions) rather than broad defense spending.

### Prediction markets

| Market | Metric | Level |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Polymarket]] | US strike on Iran | **67%** |
| [[Polymarket]] | March 31 window | **+32% surge** |

---

## Key players

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| VP JD Vance | Lead US voice on escalation |
| FM Hossein Amir-Abdollahian / Araghchi | Iran diplomatic lead |
| [[Iran]] Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) | Military exercises, Hormuz control |
| [[Russia]] | Joint exercises with Iran |
| US Navy (CENTCOM) | Two carrier groups deployed |

---

## Scenario analysis

### Bull case for conflict (67% Polymarket)

- Geneva talks failed by US assessment
- Force deployment matches pre-strike patterns
- Axios reporting suggests planning for sustained campaign
- Iran fortifying sites suggests expectation of strikes
- Trump admin historically hawkish on Iran (2020 Soleimani precedent)

### Bear case (33% no strike)

- Araghchi claims talks were "constructive" — diplomatic off-ramp possible
- Carrier deployments can be coercive without kinetic action
- Full campaign ("weeks") would be enormously costly and unpopular
- Iran's Russia alliance raises escalation risk
- [[Strait of Hormuz]] closure would spike oil, hurt US consumers

### If strikes happen — market implications

| Sector | Expected impact |
|--------|----------------|
| Oil | Spike to $80-100+ if Hormuz disrupted |
| Gold | Break $5,000 convincingly |
| Defense | Further upside, especially munitions/missile makers |
| Airlines | Negative (fuel costs) |
| Shipping | Massive disruption |
| Emerging markets | Risk-off selloff |

### Specific defense beneficiaries in strike scenario

| Company | Why |
|---------|-----|
| [[Karman Holdings]] | Advanced penetrator warheads for deeply buried targets |
| [[Kratos Defense]] | Hypersonic target drones, thermal protection |
| [[RTX]] | Tomahawk missiles, Patriot systems |
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | JASSM cruise missiles, F-35 operations |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | B-21 bomber, penetrating ISR |
| [[L3Harris]] | EW, communications |

## Strait of Hormuz risk

~20% of global oil passes through the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. Iran has repeatedly threatened closure in past confrontations. Current Revolutionary Guard exercises demonstrate capability. A closure or mining scenario would be the most economically damaging aspect of any conflict.
