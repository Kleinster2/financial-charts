**Ranking Member:** Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)
**Witnesses:** Ted Sarandos (Co-CEO, Netflix), Bruce Campbell (CRO/CSO, Warner Bros. Discovery)

---

## Deal Overview

- **Netflix acquiring Warner Bros. studios + HBO/HBO Max** for ~$83B in cash
- WBD splitting off news/sports networks (CNN, TBS, HGTV) into separate company "Discovery Global"
- Paramount Skydance made rival hostile bid of $108B for all of WBD (David Ellison declined to testify)
- Netflix recently switched to all-cash offer from cash-and-stock

## Key Themes

### 1. Market Definition (YouTube as Competitor?)
- **Netflix's argument:** YouTube is the #1 platform by TV viewing time (~13% vs Netflix ~9%). They compete for same viewers, content, ad dollars, and creators. "YouTube is not just cat videos anymore. YouTube is TV."
- **Lee's pushback:** YouTube is free, doesn't produce studio content, not the same business. "They're not producing full-length feature films written by screenwriters produced by full studios."
- **Paramount's Delrahim** called Netflix's market definition "tortured and absurd" and "psychedelic antitrust"
- This is THE key regulatory question — if market = SVOD only, Netflix+HBO would exceed 30% share (presumption of illegality). If market = all TV viewing, they'd be ~10%.

### 2. Vertical vs. Horizontal Concerns
- Netflix frames this as primarily **vertical** (distribution + production)
- Lee identified **horizontal** overlap: both have streaming services, both produce content, both compete for creative talent
- **Monopsony concern:** Combined entity could suppress wages for writers, actors, directors (citing DOJ blocking of Penguin Random House / Simon & Schuster)

### 3. Theatrical Distribution
- Sarandos pledged under oath to maintain **45-day theatrical windows** for WB films
- Concern that Netflix would shift WB releases to streaming-only
- WB earned $4B+ at box office last year, received 30 Academy Award nominations

### 4. Political Dynamics
- **Trump involvement:** Bought $2M in Netflix/WBD bonds after deal announced; said he'd be "involved" in review
- Sarandos met with Trump; said deal was "very small part" of conversation
- Sarandos: "I have confidence in this case on the merits" — DOJ will decide
- **Heritage Foundation / MAGA angle:** Oversight Project report attacked Netflix as "left-wing propaganda machine"
- Sen. Hawley grilled Sarandos on "transgender ideology" in children's content
- Sen. Cruz alleged Netflix is a "left-wing company" (Obama deal, Susan Rice on board)
- Sarandos: "Netflix has no political agenda of any kind"

### 5. Labor & Jobs
- Netflix claims 155,000+ US jobs created, $225B contributed to US economy over 10 years
- $20B content spend planned for 2026 (up from $12B in 2018)
- $1B Fort Monmouth (NJ) studio conversion underway
- Hawley pressed on residuals — Sarandos called it "very complicated"
- Netflix statement: WGA residuals hit all-time high $493.9M, streaming = ~45%, mostly Netflix

### 6. Consumer Impact
- Netflix argues 80% of HBO Max subscribers also have Netflix (complementary, not competing)
- Promise of discounted bundle for dual subscribers
- Klobuchar asked about price guarantees — Sarandos: "We are a one-click cancel"
- Netflix: consumers spend ~35¢/hour vs Paramount+ at 90¢+/hour

## Warner Bros. Discovery's Position (Campbell Testimony)

- Board unanimously chose Netflix over Paramount Skydance and a third unnamed bidder
- Framed as continuation of existing separation strategy
- HBO Max positioned as "add-on" to anchor services like Netflix, not direct competitor
- 80% subscriber overlap supports this framing
- WBD continues evaluating competing offers per Delaware law obligations
- Discovery Global (CNN, TBS, HGTV, sports) to be separate company

## Sarandos Key Arguments

1. **Pro-consumer:** More content for less, bundle discount
2. **Pro-jobs:** Will increase production investment, not cut
3. **Vertical deal:** "Not the Noah's Ark problem — two of everything"
4. **WB assets are different:** 100 years of IP, theatrical distribution, studio production — things Netflix doesn't have
5. **Competition is fierce:** YouTube, Amazon, Apple, Disney all competing; Netflix is only 9% of TV viewing
6. **45-day theatrical windows preserved** (sworn testimony)
7. **Will keep producing for other networks/streamers** (WB TV studio)

## Regulatory Path Forward

- DOJ Antitrust Division reviewing (would need to sue to block)
- EU authorities also reviewing
- Some state AGs engaged
- Netflix signaling willingness to fight in court if DOJ sues
- Wild card: Trump's involvement and political dynamics
- Key question: Will DOJ chief Abigail Slater maintain independence?
