# Block AI layoffs February 2026

On February 26, 2026, [[Block]] CEO [[Jack Dorsey]] announced the company would cut ~4,000 employees — nearly 40% of its workforce — reducing headcount from 10,205 to under 6,000. The announcement came alongside Q4 2025 earnings. Stock surged ~24% after-hours.

What made this different from typical tech layoffs: Dorsey explicitly attributed the cuts to AI, not restructuring, not macro, not overhiring. He framed it as a permanent structural shift and predicted most companies would reach the same conclusion within a year.

## The numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Employees before | 10,205 (Dec 31, 2025) |
| Employees after | ~6,000 |
| Jobs cut | ~4,000 |
| Cut depth | ~40% |
| Restructuring charge | $450-500M (severance, benefits, vesting) |
| Timeline | Complete by end of Q2 2026 |

## Q4 2025 earnings (same day)

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $6.25B | — |
| Gross profit | $2.87B | +24% |
| Adj EPS | $0.65 | +38% (vs $0.47) |
| FY2025 gross profit | $10B+ | +17% |
| FY2026 gross profit guide | $12.2B | +18% |
| FY2026 adj EPS guide | $3.66 | vs $3.22 est |

This was not a struggling company. Block was growing, profitable, and guiding up — then cut 40% of its workforce anyway.

## Market reaction

Stock (ticker: XYZ, formerly SQ) surged ~24% after-hours on Feb 26, +18% premarket Feb 27. Billions in market cap created the moment Dorsey announced he was eliminating 4,000 jobs.

The signal to every CEO: **the market will reward you for replacing humans with AI.**

## Dorsey's framing

From the shareholder letter and X post:

- "We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong."
- "The intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company."
- "Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes."
- "I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively."
- Chose one deep cut over repeated rounds — "destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead."

## The Dorsey paradox

Forbes flagged the irony: Dorsey spent two decades building companies that were, by most accounts, overstaffed. Twitter had ~7,500 employees when [[Elon Musk]] acquired it in 2022 — Musk cut 80% and the platform kept running. Block itself had done three prior rounds of cuts since late 2023 (8% in late 2023, ~1,000 in Jan 2024, 931 in March 2025) without mentioning AI.

The question: is this genuinely AI-driven transformation, or a belated right-sizing dressed up in the language of the moment?

[[Oxford Economics]]' Ben May: "We suspect some firms are trying to dress up layoffs as a good news story rather than a bad one — pointing to technological change instead of past overhiring."

## Part of a pattern

Block is the largest and most explicit [[AI labor displacement]] event to date, but not the first:

| Company | Date | Cuts | AI attribution |
|---------|------|------|----------------|
| [[Chegg]] | Oct 2025 | 45% workforce | "New realities of AI" |
| [[Pinterest]] | Jan 2026 | Undisclosed | Redirect resources to AI |
| [[Dow Inc]] | Jan 2026 | 4,500 | AI + automation |
| [[CrowdStrike]] | Feb 2026 | Undisclosed | AI reshaping workforce |
| [[Salesforce]] | 2025 | ~4,000 support roles | AI customer service |
| [[Amazon]] | Jan 2026 | 16,000 | AI implied (not explicit) |
| **[[Block]]** | **Feb 2026** | **4,000 (40%)** | **Direct, unambiguous** |

Challenger, Gray and Christmas data: 55,000 jobs in 2025 directly attributed to AI — 12× the number two years prior.

## Why this matters for the cascade

Block fits squarely in the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] — payments intermediation was already identified as a threatened layer. But this event is distinct: it's not the *market* repricing a company on AI disruption fears. It's the *company itself* confirming the thesis and acting on it. Dorsey validated what the cascade was pricing in.

The stock reaction (+24%) creates a template: announce AI-driven workforce reduction → stock pops → other CEOs take notice. This is the mechanism by which the cascade becomes self-reinforcing — not just market fear, but actual corporate action.
