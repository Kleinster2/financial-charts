## What happened

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Filing date | May 7, 2020 |
| Chapter | Chapter 11 |
| Trigger | COVID-19 store closures |
| Prior owners | [[Ares Management]], [[Canada]] Pension Plan |
| Emerged | September 2020 |

**First major US retailer to file bankruptcy during COVID pandemic.**

## Pre-bankruptcy ownership

| Owner | Stake | Entry |
|-------|-------|-------|
| [[Ares Management]] | ~50% | 2013 LBO |
| [[Canada]] Pension Plan | ~50% | 2013 LBO |

**2013 LBO:** $6B deal loaded company with debt.

---

## Restructuring

| Metric | Pre | Post |
|--------|-----|------|
| Debt | ~$5B | ~$1B (reduced) |
| Ownership | Ares/CPPIB | Creditors |

**Key terms:**
- Creditors took ownership
- Debt reduced but not eliminated
- Emerged as "leaner" company
- Legacy obligations remained

---

## Why it matters

**Set up the Saks disaster:**
- Neiman emerged with restructured but still significant debt
- When [[Saks-Neiman merger]] happened (2024), Saks assumed this legacy
- Combined debt load proved fatal → [[Saks bankruptcy]]

**The lesson:** Emerging from bankruptcy doesn't mean debt-free. Neiman's "fresh start" still carried ~$2.8B that became [[Saks Global]]'s burden.
