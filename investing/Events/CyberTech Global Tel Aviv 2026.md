# CyberTech Global Tel Aviv 2026

The 13th edition of [[Israel]]'s flagship cybersecurity conference (Jan 26-28, Expo [[Tel Aviv]]) doubled as a victory lap for the sector — $8.27B raised in 2025, exits valued at $72.6B — and a post-hostage-return moment of national catharsis.

## Key numbers (IVC / Cybertech joint report)

| Metric | 2025 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| VC funding raised | $8.27B | $3.96B | +109% |
| Active cyber companies | 597 | 546 | +9% |
| Average deal size | ~$60M | ~$30M | ~2x |
| Exit value (total) | $72.6B | — | — |
| Exit value (ex-Wiz/CyberArk/Armis) | $2B | — | — |
| Number of exits | 32 | 27 | +19% |
| Late-stage capital | $5.43B | — | lion's share |

The $8.27B figure surpasses the previous record of $7.5B set in 2021. Cyber and AI combined accounted for 70% of all Israeli tech capital raised in 2025.

> The exit headline is dominated by three pending mega-deals — [[Wiz]], [[CyberArk]], and [[Armis]]. Strip those out and exit value actually fell, even as exit count rose. Concentration risk in Israeli cyber liquidity.

## Stage breakdown (YL Ventures data, 130 rounds)

| Stage | Rounds | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Seed | 71 | +97% vs 2023; avg size $9.6M (was $2.9M in 2015) |

## Themes on stage

- AI security — 12 companies funded in "security for AI" (vs 8 in 2024); the sector is bifurcating into AI-for-security and security-for-AI
- Critical infrastructure — Ashdod Port case study: 14% of [[Israel]]'s cargo, 100K attacks/week, port remained fully operational through wartime thanks to dedicated cyber teams and [[INCD]] collaboration
- Endpoint resurgence — 11 endpoint security rounds in 2025 vs 1 in 2024
- Vulnerability & risk management — 20 companies funded, largest category
- Consolidation via M&A — [[Check Point]], Cato Networks, Cyera, Pentera, Orca Security collectively acquired 12 domestic startups in 2025

## What matters

Israeli cyber is structurally advantaged — mandatory military service feeds Unit 8200 → startup pipeline → exits → recycled capital. The 2025 numbers confirm the flywheel survived the war. But the concentration in three mega-exits and the shift to global (mostly US) VC dominance at seed stage are worth watching — it may mean Israeli founders increasingly build for US acquirers from day one, hollowing out the domestic ecosystem over time.

The 93% software focus also means Israel plays almost no role in cybersecurity hardware or silicon — a potential gap as edge security and sovereign compute become themes.
