# February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade

A rolling, sector-by-sector market panic triggered by a sequence of AI product launches and research that made the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis concrete and tradeable. Over three weeks, the selloff rippled from software → legal/data → insurance → wealth management → industrial software → transport → cybersecurity → payments/private credit, culminating in the [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citrini report]] tying them all together into one macro narrative.

**Total estimated market cap destruction:** >$1 trillion across all sub-events.

The unifying thesis: **AI is collapsing the value of intermediation** — businesses that sit between buyers and products/services, earning fees on information asymmetry, comparison complexity, or advisory work. Each sub-event hit a different sector but exposed the same underlying vulnerability.

## Catalyst

**January 30, 2026:** [[Anthropic]] launched **Cowork Plugins** — 11 open-source, job-specific plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, financial, and data workflows. This made AI disruption of white-collar work tangible and immediate, not theoretical.

Prior Cowork milestones (Jan 12 research preview → Jan 16 Pro → Jan 23 Team/Enterprise) built capability. The Plugins launch on Jan 30 was the spark that hit the market on Feb 3.

## Timeline

### Week 1: Software & Data (Feb 3-8)

**[[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Cowork Plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, data workflows |
| Damage | **$611B** erased from software/services stocks |
| Key victims | [[Thomson Reuters]] (legal data), [[RELX]] (analytics), [[FactSet]] (financial data), [[Morningstar]] (investment research), [[Intuit]] -34%, [[ServiceNow]] -28%, [[Salesforce]] -26% |
| Pattern | Information intermediaries — companies that aggregate, present, or advise on data |

Wall Street dubbed it the "SaaSpocalypse." The [[AI workflow disruption basket]] emerged as a distinct factor.

### Week 2: Insurance (Feb 9)

**[[Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026|Insurify selloff]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | [[Insurify]]'s ChatGPT app enabled AI-powered insurance comparison inside a 300M-user platform |
| Damage | S&P Insurance index -3.9% in one day |
| Key victims | [[Willis Towers Watson]] -12%, [[Arthur J. Gallagher]] -9.9%, [[Aon]] -9.3% |
| Pattern | Comparison intermediaries — brokers who earn commissions matching buyers to carriers |
| Survivors | Insurance carriers ([[Progressive]], [[Chubb]]) relatively spared — they manufacture the product |

### Week 2: Wealth Management (Feb 10)

**[[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI tax planning tool commoditized high-value advisory work |
| Key victims | [[Raymond James]] -8.5%, [[LPL Financial]] -8.4%, [[Charles Schwab]] -8.1%, [[Stifel Financial]] -7.2% |
| Pattern | Advisory intermediaries — firms earning fees on tax planning, portfolio construction, financial planning |
| Survivors | Pure execution platforms like [[Interactive Brokers]] (IBKR, +15% YTD through all shocks) |

### Week 2: Financial Data & Industrial Software (Feb 11)

**Multiple concurrent hits:**

- **[[ION Group]]** bonds sold off — parent of [[Dealogic]] (deal league tables) and [[Mergermarket]] (M&A intelligence). Classic information intermediaries with leveraged debt structure
- **[[Dassault Systèmes]]** crashed **-18 to 21%** — worst day in company history, ~€6B wiped. Biggest European SaaSpocalypse casualty. AI threatens CAD/PLM/simulation workflows
- **European wealth management contagion** — Altruist selloff crossed the Atlantic: [[St. James's Place]], [[Quilter]] -5%, [[AJ Bell]] -6.5%, [[Rathbones]] -4%, [[Julius Baer]]

### Week 3: Transport (early-mid Feb)

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Per WSJ: "a onetime karaoke machine-maker touted new AI tools to streamline trucking" |
| Damage | Transport stocks had "one of their worst days ever." Dow Jones Transportation Average hit hard |
| Pattern | Logistics intermediaries — dispatch, routing, fleet management |
| Note | Many stocks "clawed back much of their losses," leaving investors describing the market as "trigger-happy" |

### Week 3: Cybersecurity (Feb 21)

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Anthropic unveiled a new Claude security tool |
| Key victim | [[CrowdStrike]] -8% Friday, -10% Monday (Feb 23). Down 25%+ YTD |
| Pattern | Security software — AI threatening to automate threat detection/response |

### Week 3 Climax: The Citrini Synthesis (Feb 22-23)

**[[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Viral Substack scenario exercise tying all the threads together into one macro narrative |
| Damage | **Dow -822 (-1.7%), S&P -1%, Nasdaq -1.1%.** IGV (software ETF) hit 52-week low, erased all post-ChatGPT gains |
| Key victims | [[IBM]] **-13%** (worst day since 2000), [[Intuit]] -8%, [[CrowdStrike]] -10%, [[Zscaler]] -10%, [[American Express]] -7.7%, [[DoorDash]] -6.6%, [[Mastercard]] -6.3%, [[Apollo Global]] -5%, [[Salesforce]] -5.3% |
| New contagion | **Private credit** — [[Blue Owl Capital]] -3.4%, [[Apollo Global]] -5%. Lenders from Wall Street banks to regionals sold off |
| Pattern | Citrini's "one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth" — the synthesis that connected all prior sub-events into a single macro risk |

Flight to safety: 10Y Treasury → 4.026% (lowest since Nov), gold → $5,204/oz, silver → $86.52/oz.

## The Common Thread

Every sub-event hit the **distribution/advisory/middleware layer**, not the production/execution layer:

| Layer hit | Example victims | Example survivors |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Data aggregation | Thomson Reuters, RELX, FactSet | Primary data sources |
| Insurance broking | WTW, Aon, Gallagher | Progressive, Chubb (carriers) |
| Wealth advisory | Schwab, Raymond James, LPL | Interactive Brokers (execution) |
| SaaS workflows | ServiceNow, Salesforce, Intuit | Infrastructure (AWS, Azure) |
| Payments intermediation | Visa, Mastercard, AmEx | — |
| Customer service outsourcing | [[Teleperformance]], [[Concentrix]] | — |
| Private credit to SaaS | Apollo, Blue Owl, KKR | — |

The market learned to ask one question: **"Is this company's revenue a function of human friction?"** If yes, sell.

---

## Cumulative YTD damage (as of Feb 23)

| Stock | YTD return |
|-------|-----------|
| INTU | **-47%** |
| DOCU | -40% |
| ZS | -37% |
| NOW | -35% |
| CRM | -34% |
| ADBE | -30% |
| CRWD | -26% |

IGV (software ETF): **-30% YTD**, back to pre-ChatGPT levels.

## Key quotes

- **Citrini:** *"One long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth"*
- **UBS:** *"The key risk is speed of disruption rather than its existence. A rapid shock within 12 months could overwhelm contractual protections"*
- **Jordan Rizzuto** (GammaRoad): *"Be careful what kind of rotation you wish for"*
- **Jim Cramer:** *"I can't help but grow more pessimistic when I see how easily a piece of science fiction can crush the market as if it's science fact"*
- **DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang:** *"The ground is shifting underneath our feet"*
- **Jared Sleeper** (Avenir): *"If there was any effort to outsource your job to India, that's at risk"*

## Ongoing: BPO sector (Feb 24+)

**[[Teleperformance]] short interest surge**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Signal | Short interest rose to **6.4%** (from 3.8% in late Jan), vs 2.4% EU tech-services avg |
| Stock | Down **85% from €402 ATH** (Jan 2022) to ~€60 |
| Context | The OG AI disruption victim — [[Klarna]] chatbot crash (Feb 2024) was the first concrete proof point |
| Pattern | Labor intermediaries — companies profiting from cheap human labor that AI directly replaces |
| Catalyst | Rising evidence from [[Klarna]], [[Insurify]], and others that AI chatbots handle 60-70% of customer interactions |
| Upcoming | TEP earnings Thursday Feb 27 — next data point |

Teleperformance is the **canary that's been dying longest**. Unlike the SaaSpocalypse stocks (which crashed suddenly in Feb 2026), TEP has been in a slow-motion collapse since early 2024. It validates the Citrini thesis: AI disruption doesn't need to be sudden — gradual replacement of intermediary labor is equally destructive to equity value.

## Week 4: The Anthropic reversal (Feb 24)

**Anthropic enterprise agents event — the same company that started the cascade now reverses it**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Anthropic announced Claude Cowork partnerships with [[Intuit]], [[Salesforce]]/Slack, [[DocuSign]], [[LegalZoom]], [[FactSet]], Gmail |
| Market reaction | **Software stocks rallied sharply** — the first major bounce since the cascade began |

| Stock | Feb 24 move |
|-------|-------------|
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | **+11%** |
| [[FactSet]] | +6% |
| [[Salesforce]] | +4% |
| [[DocuSign]] | +2% |
| [[LegalZoom]] | +2% |
| [[IBM]] | +2% (reversal from -13% the day before) |
| Cybersecurity (OKTA, NET, ZS, TENB, S) | +2-4% bounce |

### The narrative flip

Three weeks earlier, Anthropic's Cowork Plugins launch **triggered** the SaaSpocalypse — $611B wiped from software stocks. Now the same company's partnership announcements **reversed** it. The message shifted from "AI replaces software" to "AI augments software."

**Wedbush:** AI competition risk is "overblown" — models can't replace workflows "deeply embedded" in software infrastructure. "These new AI tools will not rip and replace existing software ecosystems."

### Why it matters

The Intuit deal is the template. Rather than Claude replacing TurboTax/QuickBooks, Anthropic is embedding Intuit's domain expertise *inside* Claude via [[MCP]] integrations. Both companies benefit:
- **Intuit** gets distribution through Claude's user base + AI-powered agents on its platform
- **Anthropic** gets trusted financial data/tools that make Claude more useful
- **Mid-market businesses** get custom AI agents built on Intuit's compliance framework

This is the **"if you can't beat them, join them"** moment. The market realized that AI labs need software companies' data, compliance, and domain expertise — creating partnership value, not just displacement.

### Caveat

The bounce may be temporary. Partnerships don't prevent long-term disruption — they may just slow it. If Claude becomes the interface and Intuit becomes a back-end data provider, Intuit's pricing power could still erode over time. The stock is still -47% YTD despite the bounce.

## The incumbency debate (Feb 24)

A day after the Anthropic partnership announcements, the SaaS industry was split on whether the cascade represents genuine structural disruption or cloud-transition-style panic. The central question: do AI agents replace enterprise software, or plug into it?

### The disaggregation risk

[[RBC]]'s Rishi Jaluria framed the bear case: AI agents sitting on top of SaaS apps create "long-term disaggregation risk" — value migrates from the application layer to the agent orchestration layer. Simultaneously, enterprises are diverting IT budgets toward AI spending, making traditional software cross-selling harder.

AI revenue remains tiny relative to total SaaS revenue despite the narrative dominance:

| Company | AI revenue | Total revenue | AI as % of total |
|---------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| [[ServiceNow]] | ~$600M annual (ahead of target) | ~$16B expected FY2026 | ~3.75% |
| [[Salesforce]] | $540M ARR (Q3) → $800M (Q4) | ~$41.5B FY26 | ~1.3-1.9% |

### The cloud transition analogy

The bull case came from [[Aaron Levie]] ([[Box]]): the cloud was initially seen as an existential threat, but incumbents' business model "post-cloud was even better." [[Bernstein|AllianceBernstein]]'s Jim Tierney leaned toward agents plugging into existing systems rather than replacing them.

[[ServiceNow]] CFO Gina Mastantuono's defense: ServiceNow has governance controls, security infrastructure, and business context that standalone AI agents lack.

### The orchestration question

"Orchestration" — managing constellations of AI agents alongside human workers — emerged as the key control point for the next computing platform. [[OpenAI]]'s Frontier agent framework claims to solve "fragmentation" between clouds, platforms, and applications. If the orchestration layer becomes the primary interface, companies like [[ServiceNow]] and [[Salesforce]] risk becoming back-end service providers — still necessary, but with diminished pricing power.

The SaaS stocks chart tells the story: [[ServiceNow]], [[SAP]], [[Salesforce]], [[Atlassian]], [[Workday]] all peaked between Q1 and Q3 2025, declining since.

## The financial structure problem

The cascade exposed a structural vulnerability in SaaS financials that predates AI: there is no valuation floor.

Jared Sleeper (Avenir, growth investor, ex-Coatue public software) on Bloomberg Odd Lots (Feb 11):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median public software co GAAP net income margin | **5%** |
| Median growth rate (Q3 2025) | 18% (stable) |
| Net revenue retention | ~110% (stable) |
| Companies accelerating growth | Increasing each of last 3 quarters |

Management teams are "addicted to reporting non-GAAP" which excludes stock-based compensation. A CFO tells the CEO they're running a 25% operating margin when reality is breakeven. No material GAAP earnings → no buybacks → no dividends → no value investors → no floor under the stock.

FreshWorks example: 1.5x EV/sales, top-line results "pretty good," but no material GAAP earnings and no trajectory toward them. Stock -16% on earnings.

### Terminal value vs current performance

The disconnect is stark: fundamentals are not deteriorating, but stocks are pricing in terminal value destruction 3-5 years out. Sleeper's framework — two arguments against software:

1. World stays the same, software just gets cheaper to build → he doesn't buy this (cost savings benefit incumbents too)
2. World gets "really weird" — knowledge work itself changes, maybe no customer support reps, sales reps, or software engineers in 3-5 years → this is what's driving the selloff

Pod shop dynamics amplify: [[Citadel]], Balyasny, Millennium are large share of trading volume, can't afford drawdowns, and "have no idea when it will stop" because the selloff isn't fundamental. One [[OpenAI]] or [[Anthropic]] model release away from more fear.

### The intelligence reselling opportunity (bull case)

If software companies capture the AI transition, the pricing paradigm shifts dramatically:

| Old model | New model |
|-----------|-----------|
| $1,000/seat/year (tool for a $250-300K employee) | $50,000 to replace that employee |
| Selling tools | Selling outcomes |
| Per-seat pricing | Per-result or per-conversation pricing |

Gross margins on reselling intelligence: 20-80% range, ~50% considered "about right." Intercom (customer support software) already demonstrating this: Fin AI product at ~$100M ARR on a ~$300M base — built on reselling model vendor intelligence with domain-specific context.

[[DocuSign]] has more employees today than [[OpenAI]] and [[Anthropic]] combined — suggesting significant labor inefficiency across the sector that could be unlocked.

## Open questions

1. **Is the market trigger-happy or prescient?** Transport stocks bounced back quickly. Will software/payments follow, or is this structural?
2. **Salesforce earnings (Feb 25):** Q4 showed $800M [[Agentforce]] ARR (+169%) and fastest growth in 2 years, but FY27 guide barely missed ($46.0B vs $46.02B est). Organic growth ex-[[Informatica]] only ~7-8%. Seat compression risk vs AI consumption upside remains unresolved
3. **Private credit marks** — the Citrini scenario's most actionable risk. PE-backed SaaS LBOs at peak multiples face a reckoning if revenues compress
4. **Does the cascade continue?** Each week has hit a new sector. What's next — healthcare IT? Education tech? Consulting firms?
5. **Policy response** — no government or central bank has addressed AI displacement risk. Will this cascade force the conversation?
