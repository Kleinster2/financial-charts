# February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade

A rolling, sector-by-sector market panic triggered by a sequence of AI product launches and research that made the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis concrete and tradeable. Over three weeks, the selloff rippled from software → legal/data → insurance → wealth management → industrial software → transport → cybersecurity → payments/private credit, culminating in the [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citrini report]] tying them all together into one macro narrative.

**Total estimated market cap destruction:** >$1 trillion across all sub-events.

The unifying thesis: **AI is collapsing the value of intermediation** — businesses that sit between buyers and products/services, earning fees on information asymmetry, comparison complexity, or advisory work. Each sub-event hit a different sector but exposed the same underlying vulnerability.

---

## Synthesis

Four weeks in, the cascade has revealed its true structure: this is not a panic — it's a repricing of the entire intermediation layer of the economy, and the market is still sorting winners from losers in real time.

The sell side initially called it overdone ([[JPMorgan]]: "sentenced before trial"). Then Anthropic's own partnership announcements on Feb 24 flipped the narrative from "AI replaces software" to "AI augments software," bouncing [[Thomson Reuters]] +11% and [[Salesforce]] +4% in a day. But the bounce didn't stick for application software — [[Polar Capital]]'s Nick Evans (99th percentile fund, $12B AUM) has liquidated all app software positions and says most companies will go the way of newspapers. [[Workday]] beat on every metric and still trades -50% from 2024 highs. The market is pricing terminal value destruction 3-5 years out while current fundamentals are fine — median public software GAAP net income margin is just 5%, so there's no earnings floor to catch the falling knife.

The key distinction that's emerging: **application software** (seats, workflows — [[Intuit]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Salesforce]], [[Adobe]]) faces existential risk. **Infrastructure software** (plumbing — [[Cloudflare]], [[Datadog]], [[Snowflake]], [[Fastly]]) benefits from AI traffic growth and is recovering while the broader software ETF stays down 22%. SOX vs IGV divergence: ~77 percentage points. The rotation into hardware, energy, and infrastructure is accelerating.

The structural vulnerability is the SBC vicious cycle: stock-based compensation loses value as shares fall → companies must pay more cash → free cash flow compressed → stock falls further. Add the cost of acquiring AI startups to stay competitive and many SaaS businesses face a financial squeeze even if revenues hold.

Unresolved: Is the Anthropic partnership model (AI labs *need* software companies' data and compliance) a durable moat, or just a slower path to the same disintermediation? The [[Intuit]] deal — Claude embeds Intuit's domain expertise via [[MCP]] — is the template. Both sides benefit today. But if Claude becomes the interface and Intuit becomes a back-end data provider, Intuit's pricing power erodes over time. The cascade may have paused, but the structural question remains open.

## Catalyst

**January 30, 2026:** [[Anthropic]] launched **Cowork Plugins** — 11 open-source, job-specific plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, financial, and data workflows. This made AI disruption of white-collar work tangible and immediate, not theoretical.

Prior Cowork milestones (Jan 12 research preview → Jan 16 Pro → Jan 23 Team/Enterprise) built capability. The Plugins launch on Jan 30 was the spark that hit the market on Feb 3.

| Pattern | Comparison intermediaries — brokers who earn commissions matching buyers to carriers |
| Survivors | Insurance carriers ([[Progressive]], [[Chubb]]) relatively spared — they manufacture the product |

### Week 2: Wealth Management (Feb 10)

**[[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]]**

### Week 2: Financial Data & Industrial Software (Feb 11)

**Multiple concurrent hits:**

- **[[ION Group]]** bonds sold off — parent of [[Dealogic]] (deal league tables) and [[Mergermarket]] (M&A intelligence). Classic information intermediaries with leveraged debt structure
- **[[Dassault Systèmes]]** crashed **-18 to 21%** — worst day in company history, ~€6B wiped. Biggest European SaaSpocalypse casualty. AI threatens CAD/PLM/simulation workflows
- **European wealth management contagion** — Altruist selloff crossed the Atlantic: [[St. James's Place]], [[Quilter]] -5%, [[AJ Bell]] -6.5%, [[Rathbones]] -4%, [[Julius Baer]]

### Week 3: Transport (early-mid Feb)

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Per WSJ: "a onetime karaoke machine-maker touted new AI tools to streamline trucking" |
| Damage | Transport stocks had "one of their worst days ever." Dow Jones Transportation Average hit hard |
| Pattern | Logistics intermediaries — dispatch, routing, fleet management |
| Note | Many stocks "clawed back much of their losses," leaving investors describing the market as "trigger-happy" |

### Week 3: Cybersecurity (Feb 21)

| New contagion | **Private credit** — [[Blue Owl Capital]] -3.4%, [[Apollo Global]] -5%. Lenders from Wall Street banks to regionals sold off |
| Pattern | Citrini's "one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth" — the synthesis that connected all prior sub-events into a single macro risk |

Flight to safety: 10Y Treasury → 4.026% (lowest since Nov), gold → $5,204/oz, silver → $86.52/oz.

## The Common Thread

Every sub-event hit the **distribution/advisory/middleware layer**, not the production/execution layer:

| Layer hit | Example victims | Example survivors |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Data aggregation | Thomson Reuters, RELX, FactSet | Primary data sources |
| Insurance broking | WTW, Aon, Gallagher | Progressive, Chubb (carriers) |
| Wealth advisory | Schwab, Raymond James, LPL | Interactive Brokers (execution) |
| SaaS workflows | ServiceNow, Salesforce, Intuit | Infrastructure (AWS, Azure) |
| Payments intermediation | Visa, Mastercard, AmEx | — |
| Customer service outsourcing | [[Teleperformance]], [[Concentrix]] | — |
| Private credit to SaaS | Apollo, Blue Owl, KKR | — |

The market learned to ask one question: **"Is this company's revenue a function of human friction?"** If yes, sell.

---

## Cumulative YTD damage (as of Feb 23)

| Stock | YTD return |
|-------|-----------|
| INTU | **-47%** |
| DOCU | -40% |
| ZS | -37% |
| NOW | -35% |
| CRM | -34% |
| ADBE | -30% |
| CRWD | -26% |

IGV (software ETF): **-30% YTD**, back to pre-ChatGPT levels.

## Key quotes

- **Citrini:** *"One long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth"*
- **UBS:** *"The key risk is speed of disruption rather than its existence. A rapid shock within 12 months could overwhelm contractual protections"*
- **Jordan Rizzuto** (GammaRoad): *"Be careful what kind of rotation you wish for"*
- **Jim Cramer:** *"I can't help but grow more pessimistic when I see how easily a piece of science fiction can crush the market as if it's science fact"*
- **DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang:** *"The ground is shifting underneath our feet"*
- **Jared Sleeper** (Avenir): *"If there was any effort to outsource your job to India, that's at risk"*

---

## Ongoing: BPO sector (Feb 24+)

**[[Teleperformance]] short interest surge**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Signal | Short interest rose to **6.4%** (from 3.8% in late Jan), vs 2.4% EU tech-services avg |
| Stock | Down **85% from €402 ATH** (Jan 2022) to ~€60 |
| Context | The OG AI disruption victim — [[Klarna]] chatbot crash (Feb 2024) was the first concrete proof point |
| Pattern | Labor intermediaries — companies profiting from cheap human labor that AI directly replaces |
| Catalyst | Rising evidence from [[Klarna]], [[Insurify]], and others that AI chatbots handle 60-70% of customer interactions |
| Upcoming | TEP earnings Thursday Feb 27 — next data point |

Teleperformance is the **canary that's been dying longest**. Unlike the SaaSpocalypse stocks (which crashed suddenly in Feb 2026), TEP has been in a slow-motion collapse since early 2024. It validates the Citrini thesis: AI disruption doesn't need to be sudden — gradual replacement of intermediary labor is equally destructive to equity value.

See [[Teleperformance]] for full deep dive including bull/bear case.

### Feb 26: Teleperformance earnings — the first test

[[Teleperformance]] FY2025: revenue €10.21B (-0.7%), adj EBITA €1.49B (-3.4%). FY2026 guide: LFL growth 0-2%, margin 14.6% (beat est. 14.3%), FCF €800-850M (miss est. €918M). CEO succession: Daniel Julien exits, Jorge Amar takes over March 15.

The bears expected faster collapse. Revenue is declining but not collapsing. Does this validate "melting ice cube" or "the market overreacted"? At 85% below ATH, the stock was already pricing near-zero growth — which is roughly what the company delivered. The AI disruption thesis isn't wrong, but its timeline may be slower than the equity market assumed.

## Week 4: The Anthropic reversal (Feb 24)

**Anthropic enterprise agents event — the same company that started the cascade now reverses it**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Anthropic announced Claude Cowork partnerships with [[Intuit]], [[Salesforce]]/Slack, [[DocuSign]], [[LegalZoom]], [[FactSet]], Gmail |
| Market reaction | **Software stocks rallied sharply** — the first major bounce since the cascade began |

| Stock | Feb 24 move |
|-------|-------------|
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | **+11%** |
| [[FactSet]] | +6% |
| [[Salesforce]] | +4% |
| [[DocuSign]] | +2% |
| [[LegalZoom]] | +2% |
| [[IBM]] | +2% (reversal from -13% the day before) |
| Cybersecurity (OKTA, NET, ZS, TENB, S) | +2-4% bounce |

### The narrative flip

Three weeks earlier, Anthropic's Cowork Plugins launch **triggered** the SaaSpocalypse — $611B wiped from software stocks. Now the same company's partnership announcements **reversed** it. The message shifted from "AI replaces software" to "AI augments software."

**Wedbush:** AI competition risk is "overblown" — models can't replace workflows "deeply embedded" in software infrastructure. "These new AI tools will not rip and replace existing software ecosystems."

### Why it matters

The Intuit deal is the template. Rather than Claude replacing TurboTax/QuickBooks, Anthropic is embedding Intuit's domain expertise *inside* Claude via [[MCP]] integrations. Both companies benefit:
- **Intuit** gets distribution through Claude's user base + AI-powered agents on its platform
- **Anthropic** gets trusted financial data/tools that make Claude more useful
- **Mid-market businesses** get custom AI agents built on Intuit's compliance framework

This is the **"if you can't beat them, join them"** moment. The market realized that AI labs need software companies' data, compliance, and domain expertise — creating partnership value, not just displacement.

### Caveat

The bounce may be temporary. Partnerships don't prevent long-term disruption — they may just slow it. If Claude becomes the interface and Intuit becomes a back-end data provider, Intuit's pricing power could still erode over time. The stock is still -47% YTD despite the bounce.

---

## The incumbency debate (Feb 24)

A day after the Anthropic partnership announcements, the SaaS industry was split on whether the cascade represents genuine structural disruption or cloud-transition-style panic. The central question: do AI agents replace enterprise software, or plug into it?

### The disaggregation risk

[[RBC]]'s Rishi Jaluria framed the bear case: AI agents sitting on top of SaaS apps create "long-term disaggregation risk" — value migrates from the application layer to the agent orchestration layer. Simultaneously, enterprises are diverting IT budgets toward AI spending, making traditional software cross-selling harder.

AI revenue remains tiny relative to total SaaS revenue despite the narrative dominance:

| Company | AI revenue | Total revenue | AI as % of total |
|---------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| [[ServiceNow]] | ~$600M annual (ahead of target) | ~$16B expected FY2026 | ~3.75% |
| [[Salesforce]] | $540M ARR (Q3) → $800M (Q4) | ~$41.5B FY26 | ~1.3-1.9% |

### The cloud transition analogy

The bull case came from [[Aaron Levie]] ([[Box]]): the cloud was initially seen as an existential threat, but incumbents' business model "post-cloud was even better." [[Bernstein|AllianceBernstein]]'s Jim Tierney leaned toward agents plugging into existing systems rather than replacing them.

[[ServiceNow]] CFO Gina Mastantuono's defense: ServiceNow has governance controls, security infrastructure, and business context that standalone AI agents lack.

### The orchestration question

"Orchestration" — managing constellations of AI agents alongside human workers — emerged as the key control point for the next computing platform. [[OpenAI]]'s Frontier agent framework claims to solve "fragmentation" between clouds, platforms, and applications. If the orchestration layer becomes the primary interface, companies like [[ServiceNow]] and [[Salesforce]] risk becoming back-end service providers — still necessary, but with diminished pricing power.

The SaaS stocks chart tells the story: [[ServiceNow]], [[SAP]], [[Salesforce]], [[Atlassian]], [[Workday]] all peaked between Q1 and Q3 2025, declining since.

## The financial structure problem

The cascade exposed a structural vulnerability in SaaS financials that predates AI: there is no valuation floor.

Jared Sleeper (Avenir, growth investor, ex-Coatue public software) on Bloomberg Odd Lots (Feb 11):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median public software co GAAP net income margin | **5%** |
| Median growth rate (Q3 2025) | 18% (stable) |
| Net revenue retention | ~110% (stable) |
| Companies accelerating growth | Increasing each of last 3 quarters |

Management teams are "addicted to reporting non-GAAP" which excludes stock-based compensation. A CFO tells the CEO they're running a 25% operating margin when reality is breakeven. No material GAAP earnings → no buybacks → no dividends → no value investors → no floor under the stock.

FreshWorks example: 1.5x EV/sales, top-line results "pretty good," but no material GAAP earnings and no trajectory toward them. Stock -16% on earnings.

### Terminal value vs current performance

The disconnect is stark: fundamentals are not deteriorating, but stocks are pricing in terminal value destruction 3-5 years out. Sleeper's framework — two arguments against software:

1. World stays the same, software just gets cheaper to build → he doesn't buy this (cost savings benefit incumbents too)
2. World gets "really weird" — knowledge work itself changes, maybe no customer support reps, sales reps, or software engineers in 3-5 years → this is what's driving the selloff

Pod shop dynamics amplify: [[Citadel]], Balyasny, Millennium are large share of trading volume, can't afford drawdowns, and "have no idea when it will stop" because the selloff isn't fundamental. One [[OpenAI]] or [[Anthropic]] model release away from more fear.

### The intelligence reselling opportunity (bull case)

If software companies capture the AI transition, the pricing paradigm shifts dramatically:

| Old model | New model |
|-----------|-----------|
| $1,000/seat/year (tool for a $250-300K employee) | $50,000 to replace that employee |
| Selling tools | Selling outcomes |
| Per-seat pricing | Per-result or per-conversation pricing |

Gross margins on reselling intelligence: 20-80% range, ~50% considered "about right." Intercom (customer support software) already demonstrating this: Fin AI product at ~$100M ARR on a ~$300M base — built on reselling model vendor intelligence with domain-specific context.

[[DocuSign]] has more employees today than [[OpenAI]] and [[Anthropic]] combined — suggesting significant labor inefficiency across the sector that could be unlocked.

*Source: Bloomberg Odd Lots, Jared Sleeper (Avenir), Feb 11 2026*

---

## Open questions

1. **Is the market trigger-happy or prescient?** Transport stocks bounced back quickly. Will software/payments follow, or is this structural?
2. **Salesforce earnings (Feb 25):** Q4 showed $800M [[Agentforce]] ARR (+169%) and fastest growth in 2 years, but FY27 guide barely missed ($46.0B vs $46.02B est). Organic growth ex-[[Informatica]] only ~7-8%. Seat compression risk vs AI consumption upside remains unresolved
3. **Private credit marks** — the Citrini scenario's most actionable risk. PE-backed SaaS LBOs at peak multiples face a reckoning if revenues compress
4. **Does the cascade continue?** Each week has hit a new sector. What's next — healthcare IT? Education tech? Consulting firms?
5. **Policy response** — no government or central bank has addressed AI displacement risk. Will this cascade force the conversation?

---

## Central bank response (Feb 26)

**ECB President [[Christine Lagarde]]:** AI is boosting eurozone productivity but has "not yet" triggered a wave of layoffs. ECB will be "extremely attentive." First major central bank statement on AI employment effects since the cascade began.

Lagarde's "not yet" framing aligns with the [[Citadel Securities 2026 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citadel Securities]] data (flat AI adoption at work, SW eng jobs +11% Y/Y) rather than the [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citrini]] displacement scenario. The macro data and the market data are telling opposite stories: employment is stable, but stocks are pricing in displacement.

**Policy question #5 (updated):** The ECB is now watching. The cascade has forced the conversation — but monitoring is not intervention. If AI-driven layoffs materialize in H2 2026, Lagarde's "extremely attentive" becomes a policy constraint on rate decisions.

---

## The Productivity Panic (Feb 26)

Bloomberg Businessweek (Issie Lapowsky) profiled the cultural transformation driven by AI coding agents — [[Claude Code]] and [[OpenAI]] Codex specifically named.

| Signal | Data |
|--------|------|
| Working hours | UC Berkeley: people offloading to AI agents but **working longer hours** |
| C-suite perception gap | 40%+ execs say AI saves 8+ hrs/week; 67% non-managers say <2 hrs |
| Productivity gains | [[Intuit]] engineers 30% more productive (code velocity) |
| "Task expansion" | Non-technical staff vibe-coding creates cleanup work for engineers |
| Monitoring | Companies tracking "interactions per day" with coding agents |

The paradox: AI agents make workers more productive but also more anxious, surveilled, and overworked. "Vibe coding" — coined by [[Andrej Karpathy]] in Feb 2025 — has become a mandate to accelerate, not a path to leisure.

This is the micro-level manifestation of the cascade's macro thesis: AI doesn't just destroy intermediary businesses, it also transforms the labor dynamics within surviving businesses.

---

## Polar Capital: "application software faces an existential threat" (Feb 27)

Nick Evans, [[Polar Capital]] fund manager running a $12B global technology fund (beat 99% of peers over 1 year, 97% over 5), has liquidated virtually all application software positions. Sold [[SAP]], [[ServiceNow]], [[Adobe]], [[HubSpot]] — "we won't go back to these companies."

Only software position retained: small [[Microsoft]] holding + call options.

*SOX (Philadelphia Semiconductor Index) vs iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF since Feb 2025. Chips +55%, software -22% — ~77pp divergence. Source: Bloomberg.*

### Evans thesis

| Claim | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Core threat | AI coding tools ([[Claude Code|Claude Cowork]] named) can replicate and modify existing software |
| Competition source | Clients building tools internally + AI startups |
| Analogy | Application software = newspapers in the 2000s — most will die |
| SAP resilience | Complex enterprise packages more resilient, but "considerable uncertainty" on long-term valuations |
| Terminal value | "Current prices don't reflect the terminal value uncertainty or the pressure on free cash flow" |

### Portfolio positioning (Jan 2026)

| Allocation | Holdings |
|------------|----------|
| Top 10 | 7 of 10 are semiconductor companies |
| Largest position | [[NVIDIA]] (~10% of fund) |
| Bullish | Networking, fiber optics, power/energy infrastructure for data centers |
| Added | [[Cloudflare]], [[Snowflake]] (infrastructure software) |
| Neutral | Cybersecurity |
| Total infra software + cyber | <7% of fund |

### The SBC squeeze — second-order damage

Stock-based compensation creates a vicious cycle when share prices fall: employees' equity comp loses value → management must pay more cash to retain talent → free cash flow compressed → further stock decline. Acquiring AI startups to stay competitive adds to the financial strain.

### Infrastructure software divergence

![[bloomberg-infra-software-recovery.png]]
*iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF vs [[Datadog]] and [[Cloudflare]] since Dec 31, 2025. Infrastructure software recovering from lows while broader software ETF down ~22%. Source: Bloomberg.*

Evans' distinction: application software (seats, workflows) is existentially threatened. Infrastructure software (plumbing — CDN, observability, data platforms) benefits from AI traffic growth. [[Datadog]] +10% on earnings, [[Fastly]] more than doubled.

### JPMorgan counterpoint

[[JPMorgan]] strategists argued software stocks could rebound following "extreme price action." They favor [[Microsoft]] and [[ServiceNow]]. Evans disagrees on ServiceNow.
