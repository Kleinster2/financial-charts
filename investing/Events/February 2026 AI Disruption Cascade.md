# February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade

A rolling, sector-by-sector market panic triggered by a sequence of AI product launches and research that made the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis concrete and tradeable. Over three weeks, the selloff rippled from software → legal/data → insurance → wealth management → industrial software → transport → cybersecurity → payments/private credit, culminating in the [[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis|Citrini report]] tying them all together into one macro narrative.

**Total estimated market cap destruction:** >$1 trillion across all sub-events.

The unifying thesis: **AI is collapsing the value of intermediation** — businesses that sit between buyers and products/services, earning fees on information asymmetry, comparison complexity, or advisory work. Each sub-event hit a different sector but exposed the same underlying vulnerability.

## Catalyst

**January 30, 2026:** [[Anthropic]] launched **Cowork Plugins** — 11 open-source, job-specific plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, financial, and data workflows. This made AI disruption of white-collar work tangible and immediate, not theoretical.

Prior Cowork milestones (Jan 12 research preview → Jan 16 Pro → Jan 23 Team/Enterprise) built capability. The Plugins launch on Jan 30 was the spark that hit the market on Feb 3.

## Timeline

### Week 1: Software & Data (Feb 3-8)

**[[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Cowork Plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, data workflows |
| Damage | **$611B** erased from software/services stocks |
| Key victims | [[Thomson Reuters]] (legal data), [[RELX]] (analytics), [[FactSet]] (financial data), [[Morningstar]] (investment research), [[Intuit]] -34%, [[ServiceNow]] -28%, [[Salesforce]] -26% |
| Pattern | Information intermediaries — companies that aggregate, present, or advise on data |

Wall Street dubbed it the "SaaSpocalypse." The [[AI workflow disruption basket]] emerged as a distinct factor.

### Week 2: Insurance (Feb 9)

**[[Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026|Insurify selloff]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | [[Insurify]]'s ChatGPT app enabled AI-powered insurance comparison inside a 300M-user platform |
| Damage | S&P Insurance index -3.9% in one day |
| Key victims | [[Willis Towers Watson]] -12%, [[Arthur J. Gallagher]] -9.9%, [[Aon]] -9.3% |
| Pattern | Comparison intermediaries — brokers who earn commissions matching buyers to carriers |
| Survivors | Insurance carriers ([[Progressive]], [[Chubb]]) relatively spared — they manufacture the product |

### Week 2: Wealth Management (Feb 10)

**[[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI tax planning tool commoditized high-value advisory work |

### Week 2: Financial Data & Industrial Software (Feb 11)

**Multiple concurrent hits:**

- **[[ION Group]]** bonds sold off — parent of [[Dealogic]] (deal league tables) and [[Mergermarket]] (M&A intelligence). Classic information intermediaries with leveraged debt structure
- **[[Dassault Systèmes]]** crashed **-18 to 21%** — worst day in company history, ~€6B wiped. Biggest European SaaSpocalypse casualty. AI threatens CAD/PLM/simulation workflows
- **European wealth management contagion** — Altruist selloff crossed the Atlantic: [[St. James's Place]], [[Quilter]] -5%, [[AJ Bell]] -6.5%, [[Rathbones]] -4%, [[Julius Baer]]

### Week 3: Transport (early-mid Feb)

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Per WSJ: "a onetime karaoke machine-maker touted new AI tools to streamline trucking" |
| Damage | Transport stocks had "one of their worst days ever." Dow Jones Transportation Average hit hard |
| Pattern | Logistics intermediaries — dispatch, routing, fleet management |
| Note | Many stocks "clawed back much of their losses," leaving investors describing the market as "trigger-happy" |

### Week 3: Cybersecurity (Feb 21)

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Anthropic unveiled a new Claude security tool |
| Key victim | [[CrowdStrike]] -8% Friday, -10% Monday (Feb 23). Down 25%+ YTD |

### Week 3 Climax: The Citrini Synthesis (Feb 22-23)

**[[Citrini 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis]]**

| Detail | |
|--------|---|
| Trigger | Viral Substack scenario exercise tying all the threads together into one macro narrative |
| Damage | **Dow -822 (-1.7%), S&P -1%, Nasdaq -1.1%.** IGV (software ETF) hit 52-week low, erased all post-ChatGPT gains |

| New contagion | **Private credit** — [[Blue Owl Capital]] -3.4%, [[Apollo Global]] -5%. Lenders from Wall Street banks to regionals sold off |
| Pattern | Citrini's "one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth" — the synthesis that connected all prior sub-events into a single macro risk |

Flight to safety: 10Y Treasury → 4.026% (lowest since Nov), gold → $5,204/oz, silver → $86.52/oz.

## The Common Thread

Every sub-event hit the **distribution/advisory/middleware layer**, not the production/execution layer:

| Layer hit | Example victims | Example survivors |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Data aggregation | Thomson Reuters, RELX, FactSet | Primary data sources |
| Insurance broking | WTW, Aon, Gallagher | Progressive, Chubb (carriers) |
| Wealth advisory | Schwab, Raymond James, LPL | Interactive Brokers (execution) |
| SaaS workflows | ServiceNow, Salesforce, Intuit | Infrastructure (AWS, Azure) |
| Payments intermediation | Visa, Mastercard, AmEx | — |
| Private credit to SaaS | Apollo, Blue Owl, KKR | — |

The market learned to ask one question: **"Is this company's revenue a function of human friction?"** If yes, sell.

## Cumulative YTD damage (as of Feb 23)

| Stock | YTD return |
|-------|-----------|
| INTU | **-47%** |
| DOCU | -40% |
| ZS | -37% |
| NOW | -35% |
| CRM | -34% |
| ADBE | -30% |
| CRWD | -26% |

IGV (software ETF): **-30% YTD**, back to pre-ChatGPT levels.

## Key quotes

- **Citrini:** *"One long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth"*
- **UBS:** *"The key risk is speed of disruption rather than its existence. A rapid shock within 12 months could overwhelm contractual protections"*
- **Jordan Rizzuto** (GammaRoad): *"Be careful what kind of rotation you wish for"*
- **Jim Cramer:** *"I can't help but grow more pessimistic when I see how easily a piece of science fiction can crush the market as if it's science fact"*
- **DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang:** *"The ground is shifting underneath our feet"*

## Open questions

1. **Is the market trigger-happy or prescient?** Transport stocks bounced back quickly. Will software/payments follow, or is this structural?
2. **Salesforce earnings this week** — the bellwether. AI pricing pressure commentary will determine if this is panic or early recognition
3. **Private credit marks** — the Citrini scenario's most actionable risk. PE-backed SaaS LBOs at peak multiples face a reckoning if revenues compress
4. **Does the cascade continue?** Each week has hit a new sector. What's next — healthcare IT? Education tech? Consulting firms?
5. **Policy response** — no government or central bank has addressed AI displacement risk. Will this cascade force the conversation?
