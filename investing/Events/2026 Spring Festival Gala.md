2026 Spring Festival Gala — [[China Media Group]] (CMG) annual broadcast, Feb 16, 2026 (Year of the Horse). Humanoid robots were a centerpiece for the second consecutive year, with four robotics companies paying ~100M yuan (~$14M) combined for gala partnerships.

## Why this matters

The Spring Festival Gala is [[China]]'s most-watched TV event (~80% of active televisions tuned in for 2025 edition). It functions as [[China]]'s Super Bowl — a mainstream cultural signal, not a tech demo. Robotics moving from [[CES 2026]] trade show floors to prime-time entertainment validates the [[Humanoid robotics inflection]] thesis at the cultural level.

2025 precedent: [[Unitree]]'s "YangBOT" Yangge folk dance with 16 humanoid robots went viral. Unitree founder [[Wang Xingxing]] met President [[Xi Jinping]] at a tech symposium weeks later. Companies that appear on the gala stage receive tangible rewards in government orders, investor attention, and market access.

## Investment signal

The gala is a government-endorsed showcase. [[China]] has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation manufacturing strategy, betting that automation offsets its aging workforce. The progression from 2025 (novelty) to 2026 (weapons handling, force control, multi-company competition for gala slots) shows rapid capability improvement.

Key reads:
- [[Humanoid robotics inflection]] — cost curves and deployment thesis
- [[Robotics]] — sector overview with funding data
- [[China]] — industrial policy context
