**Clawdbot viral growth** — February 2025; fastest-growing open-source project in GitHub history, hitting 82k+ stars in weeks. Demonstrated pent-up demand for [[Agentic AI]] that "actually does things."

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Early Feb 2025** | Project launches as "Claudebot" |
| **~Feb 10** | [[Anthropic]] lawyers force rename |
| **10-second gap** | Scammers grab old GitHub/social handles |
| **Hours later** | Fake CLAW token hits $16M market cap before rugpull |
| **~Feb 15** | Security researchers find localhost auth bypass |
| **Feb 2025** | 82,000+ GitHub stars |
| **Feb 2025** | [[Cloudflare]] stock +20% |

## What it is

Clawdbot is a [[Local-first AI]] agent that:
- Runs as local daemon on your machine
- Orchestrates AI models ([[Claude]], [[GPT-4]], others)
- Executes tools: file operations, shell commands, web browsing
- Keeps conversation history and credentials local
- Uses [[Cloudflare]] Tunnels for safe internet exposure

Created by **Peter Steinberger**, who previously sold his PDF company to Insight Partners.

## Why it mattered

### 1. Demand signal

82k+ stars in weeks = massive pent-up demand for "AI that does things" vs "AI that suggests things." Users willing to accept security tradeoffs for capability.

### 2. Infrastructure validation

Clawdbot's recommended setup uses **Cloudflare Tunnels** — proving the [[Cloudflare agentic infrastructure]] thesis. Stock moved +20% on adoption.

### 3. Security wake-up call

Security researchers found:
- Localhost authentication bypass
- Exposed instances accessible from internet
- No rate limiting on some endpoints

This accelerated discussion about [[Agentic AI]] security requirements.

### 4. Scam ecosystem speed

The 10-second rename gap showed how fast crypto scammers operate:
- Old handles grabbed instantly
- Fake token launched within hours
- $16M market cap before rugpull
- Illustrates risks of AI + crypto intersection

## Market impact

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **[[Cloudflare]] +20%** | Single project adoption moved stock |
| [[Apple]] Mac Mini | Supply squeeze attributed partly to local AI demand |
| [[Memory squeeze thesis]] | Demand for high-RAM local machines |
| AI agent category | Validated consumer appetite |

---

## Lessons

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Demand is real** | Consumers want agents, not advisors |
| **Infrastructure matters** | Cloudflare Tunnels = picks and shovels |
| **Security is unsolved** | Agent security will be a major category |
| **Local-first wins** | Privacy + capability > cloud-only |
| **Naming matters** | Anthropic protecting Claude brand |
