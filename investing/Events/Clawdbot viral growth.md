## What Claude Code is

Claude Code is [[Anthropic]]'s official agentic coding tool:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Interface | Terminal CLI, VS Code, JetBrains, web |
| Core capability | Edit files, run commands, create commits |
| Integration | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Slack |
| MCP protocol | Connects to Figma, Google Drive, Slack |
| Requirement | Claude subscription (Pro/Max/Teams/Enterprise) |

**Key differentiator:** "Takes action" — directly edits files and runs commands vs just suggesting code.

## Market context

The broader [[Agentic AI]] space is exploding:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Organizations experimenting with agents | **62%** | McKinsey 2025 |
| Organizations scaling agentic AI | **23%** | McKinsey 2025 |
| Leading functions | IT, knowledge management | McKinsey 2025 |
| Leading sectors | Tech, media, telecom, healthcare | McKinsey 2025 |

## Why it matters

### 1. Demand signal

Massive developer interest in AI coding tools that actually execute rather than just suggest. Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot X, Devin all competing for this space.

### 2. Infrastructure implications

Local-first AI agents need secure tunneling:
- [[Cloudflare]] Tunnels for localhost exposure
- Authentication, encryption, DDoS protection
- Drives [[Cloudflare agentic infrastructure]] thesis

### 3. Security wake-up call

Agentic tools with file/command access create new attack surface:
- Credential exposure
- Prompt injection risks
- Localhost authentication challenges

This is accelerating discussion about [[Agentic AI]] security requirements.

## Anthropic context

[[Anthropic]] has been aggressively building around agents:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Sep 2025** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Claude Agent SDK released |
| **Sep 2025** | $13B Series F at $183B valuation |
| **Nov 2025** | Claude Opus 4.5 — "best model for coding, agents, and computer use" |
| **2025** | Revenue grew from $1B to $5B in 8 months |

Claude Code is central to Anthropic's enterprise strategy.
