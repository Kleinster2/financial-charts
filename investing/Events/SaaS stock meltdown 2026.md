# SaaS stock meltdown 2026

A sector-wide repricing of [[SaaS]] stocks running from late January through mid-February 2026, driven by investor fear that [[Agentic AI|AI agents]] from [[Anthropic]] and [[OpenAI]] will bypass traditional software interfaces entirely. The *Financial Times* editorial board codified the narrative on Feb 15, framing general-purpose agents as a new computing layer that could usurp established software companies. Cumulative damage: large-cap SaaS names down -25% to -40% YTD while [[S&P 500|SPY]] sat flat. Smaller workflow/marketing SaaS hit even harder, with [[Monday.com|MNDY]] -51% and [[Braze|BRZE]] -49%.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 20 | [[DeepSeek]] R1 launch — repriced AI moats, first wave of SaaS selling |
| Jan 27-31 | "SaaSpocalypse" — broad SaaS selloff triggered by DeepSeek implications |
| Feb 3-5 | [[Anthropic]] and [[OpenAI]] announce general-purpose agent products |
| Feb 6-13 | Second wave — selling broadens beyond AI-adjacent names to all workflow SaaS |
| Feb 15 | *Financial Times* editorial crystallizes the narrative: agents as existential threat to SaaS |

## YTD performance (Dec 31 2025 to Feb 13 2026)

### Large-cap SaaS vs QQQ

![[saas-leaders-vs-qqq-ytd-2026.png]]

*Enterprise SaaS leaders all down -25% to -40% while [[Nasdaq|QQQ]] barely dipped. [[Intuit|INTU]] and [[HubSpot|HUBS]] led losses — both sell workflow tools for non-technical users, exactly the use case AI agents threaten most.*

| Ticker | Company | YTD | Category |
|--------|---------|-----|----------|
| [[Intuit\|INTU]] | Intuit | -39.6% | SMB finance/tax |
| [[HubSpot\|HUBS]] | HubSpot | -39.2% | Marketing/CRM |
| [[Workday\|WDAY]] | Workday | -32.8% | HR/Finance |
| [[ServiceNow\|NOW]] | ServiceNow | -30.1% | IT workflows |
| [[Salesforce\|CRM]] | Salesforce | -28.4% | CRM |
| [[Adobe\|ADBE]] | Adobe | -24.6% | Creative/marketing |
| [[Nasdaq\|QQQ]] | Nasdaq 100 ETF | -2.0% | Benchmark |

### Worst-hit names vs SPY

![[saas-worst-hit-vs-spy-ytd-2026.png]]

*The worst damage concentrated in workflow/marketing SaaS with limited moats. [[Monday.com|MNDY]] halved. [[Braze|BRZE]], [[Intuit|INTU]], and [[HubSpot|HUBS]] all down -39% to -49%. These are the companies whose software handles non-essential processes easily replicated by agents.*

| Ticker | Company | YTD | Category |
|--------|---------|-----|----------|
| [[Monday.com\|MNDY]] | Monday.com | -50.9% | Work management |
| [[Braze\|BRZE]] | Braze | -48.7% | Customer engagement |
| [[Intuit\|INTU]] | Intuit | -39.6% | SMB finance |
| [[HubSpot\|HUBS]] | HubSpot | -39.2% | Marketing CRM |
| [[Workday\|WDAY]] | Workday | -32.8% | HR/Finance |
| [[UiPath\|PATH]] | UiPath | -30.9% | RPA/automation |
| [[Shopify\|SHOP]] | Shopify | -30.0% | E-commerce |
| [[S&P 500\|SPY]] | S&P 500 ETF | 0.0% | Benchmark |

### Security and observability — relative resilience

![[saas-security-obs-vs-spy-ytd-2026.png]]

*Security and observability names held up far better — [[Okta|OKTA]] and [[Cloudflare|NET]] roughly flat, [[CrowdStrike|CRWD]] and [[Palo Alto Networks|PANW]] down single digits. These are systems of record and infrastructure layers that agents actually depend on, not compete with. [[Zscaler|ZS]] was the exception, down -21%.*

| Ticker | Company | YTD | Category |
|--------|---------|-----|----------|
| [[Okta\|OKTA]] | Okta | +0.9% | Identity |
| [[Cloudflare\|NET]] | Cloudflare | -0.7% | Edge/security infra |
| [[SentinelOne\|S]] | SentinelOne | -7.5% | Endpoint security |
| [[Datadog\|DDOG]] | Datadog | -7.9% | Observability |
| [[CrowdStrike\|CRWD]] | CrowdStrike | -8.3% | Endpoint security |
| [[Palo Alto Networks\|PANW]] | Palo Alto Networks | -9.4% | Network security |
| [[Zscaler\|ZS]] | Zscaler | -21.0% | Zero trust |

## The FT framework

The *Financial Times* editorial (Feb 15) drew a taxonomy of exposure:

| Category | Risk level | Rationale | Examples |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Non-essential workflow SaaS** | Highest | No moats — agents replicate these functions without opening the app | [[Monday.com]], [[Braze]], [[UiPath]], [[Asana]] |
| **Systems of record** | Medium | Deeply entrenched, hold critical data, embed core processes — but risk fading to "utility" status | [[Salesforce]], [[Workday]], [[ServiceNow]] |
| **AI-native reinventors** | Variable | Incumbents building agent capabilities — execution dependent | [[Salesforce]] Agentforce, [[ServiceNow]] AI agents |
| **Agent infrastructure** | Beneficiary | Agents need identity, security, observability | [[Okta]], [[CrowdStrike]], [[Datadog]], [[Cloudflare]] |

> The market's verdict so far maps cleanly to this framework. The deeper a company's data moat and the harder it is to replicate its workflows, the less damage it took. Workflow tools with shallow integration got crushed.

## Catalysts

Two distinct waves, both feeding the same narrative:

**Wave 1 — DeepSeek R1 (Jan 20-31):** Forced investors to reconsider AI moats. If a Chinese lab could match frontier models at a fraction of the cost, SaaS companies claiming AI premiums lost their pricing power argument.

**Wave 2 — Agent announcements (Feb 3-13):** [[Anthropic]] and [[OpenAI]] repositioned code-generation tools as general-purpose agents for non-technical workers. This shifted the threat model from "AI helps SaaS companies" to "AI replaces SaaS companies." The market repriced accordingly.

---

## Open questions

- **How fast can agents actually replace SaaS workflows?** Enterprise-grade deployment, security (especially [[prompt injection]]), and worker retraining are real barriers
- **Will systems-of-record SaaS capture agent revenue or lose it?** [[Salesforce]] Agentforce and [[ServiceNow]] AI agents are early attempts to stay relevant
- **Is the selloff overdone?** B2B data providers ([[S&P Global|SPGI]], [[MSCI]], [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE]]) and wealth management firms caught in the crossfire may not face the same agent displacement risk
- **Does security SaaS actually benefit?** Agents with credentials create new attack surfaces — could be a tailwind for [[CrowdStrike]], [[Okta]], [[Palo Alto Networks]]
