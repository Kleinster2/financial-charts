# Apple-Google AI deal

**January 2026** — [[Apple]] and [[Google]] announce a multiyear partnership under which Apple's next-generation [[Siri]] will be powered by [[Google]]'s [[Gemini]] AI models. Apple determined that building foundation models in-house wasn't worth the investment; some Apple leaders view LLMs as future commodities.

## Deal structure

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Type | Multiyear licensing agreement |
| Google provides | [[Gemini]] models and cloud infrastructure |
| Apple provides | Distribution (2.5B active devices) |
| Privacy model | Runs through Apple devices + [[Private Cloud Compute]] |
| Data access | Google does **not** get user data (no Gmail, no personal info) |

Apple chose [[Google]] over [[OpenAI]] and other AI startups. Analysts call it a defensive win for Google — locks in the largest consumer device ecosystem.

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Jan 2026 | Deal announced (joint statement) |
| ~~March 2026~~ | ~~iOS 26.4 with new Siri~~ — **delayed** |
| **May/June 2026** | iOS 26.5 — many Siri capabilities (staggered rollout) |
| **September 2026** | iOS 27 — full chatbot revamp + personal context features |

**Feb 12 delay (Bloomberg/Gurman):** Testing snags in recent weeks pushed many capabilities from iOS 26.4 (March) to iOS 26.5 (May/June). Personal context features (tapping into apps, calendar, files) likely won't ship until iOS 27 in September — nearly 2 years after the June 2024 WWDC announcement.

## Why Apple went external

Apple's internal Siri overhaul (codename "Campos") reportedly hit development problems. Rather than continue building in-house, Apple partnered with Google. Per Bloomberg, some Apple leaders believe LLMs will commoditize and that spending heavily on proprietary models doesn't make strategic sense.

## Strategic significance

**For Google:**
- Reaches 2.5B Apple devices — massive distribution win for Gemini
- One of the largest Gemini licensing deals
- Defensive: Apple choosing Google over OpenAI validates Gemini's quality
- Revenue stream from Apple's device base

**For Apple:**
- Accelerates Siri upgrade without years of in-house model development
- Privacy preserved via Private Cloud Compute
- Frees R&D budget for hardware AI (AI Pin, smart glasses, Q.ai integration)
- Tim Cook (Q1 FY26 call): Siri will be personalized but won't access users' Google data

---

## Privacy architecture

Tim Cook emphasized on the Q1 FY26 earnings call that the Gemini-powered Siri:
- Runs on Apple devices and [[Private Cloud Compute]]
- Maintains Apple's privacy standards
- Does **not** share user data with Google
- Won't access users' Gmail or Google services
