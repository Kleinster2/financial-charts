# Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026

Back-to-back downgrades of [[Raizen]] and [[CSN]] reignited fears of broader corporate distress in [[Brazil]], where the [[Selic]] at 15% — highest in two decades — is crushing overleveraged corporates. All three major agencies slashed [[Raizen]] from investment grade to deep junk in a single day (Fitch: BBB- to CCC in seven hours). [[CSN]] also downgraded (S&P to B+, Fitch to BB-). Both are pursuing asset sales and restructuring talks. This is not an isolated event — [[Brazil]] recorded 2,273 judicial recovery filings in 2024 (+62% YoY), with 2025 expected to break that record again.

## Raizen: anatomy of the collapse

[[Raizen]] is a JV between [[Shell]] (44%) and [[Cosan]] (44%), with ~12% public float (IPO'd 2021) — the world's largest sugarcane ethanol producer, operating 24 mills, 7,000+ fuel stations, 1.3 GW biomass power, and a pioneer in second-generation cellulosic ethanol (Bonfim, world's largest E2G facility). Revenue: R$255B (FY 3/2025). It was a flagship of [[Brazil]]'s energy transition narrative.

### Financial deterioration

| Metric | Q2 FY25/26 | YoY change |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Net revenue | R$59.9B | -18% |
| Net loss | R$2.3B | vs R$158M profit |
| Gross debt | R$76.8B ($14.3B) | |
| Net debt | R$53.4B | +49% |
| Leverage (net debt/adj. EBITDA) | 5.1x | vs 2.6x |
| EBITDA (trailing) | ~R$13.3B | Fitch projects R$10.9B FY2026 |
| Cash position | R$18.6B + $1B revolvers | |
| Debt maturing in 18 months | R$10.5B (Fitch est.) | |
| Annual interest expense | ~R$9.5B | |
| Free cash flow outlook | Negative through 2027 | |
| USD bonds outstanding | ~$5.3B across 6 issues | |
| Stock (early Feb 2026) | R$0.81-0.84 | ATH R$7.60 (Aug 2021) |

S&P expects leverage could reach 6x by 2027. JP Morgan estimates ~R$18B needed to return to 2.5x; UBS BB estimates R$20-25B. Stock below [[B3]]'s R$1 minimum threshold since October — must recover by May 2026 or face sanctions.

### Rating collapse — 8 to 10 notches in 24 hours

| Agency | Pre-crisis | Final (Feb 9-10) | Notches dropped |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fitch | BBB (Jun 2024) | CCC | 10 |
| S&P | BBB (Jan 2025) | CCC+ | 8 |
| Moody's | Baa3 | Caa1 | 9 |

Fitch timeline: BBB → BBB (negative, Jun 2025) → BBB- (RWN, Oct 2025) → B (morning Feb 9) → CCC (evening Feb 9). Trigger: "failure of shareholders to execute a material capital injection." Forced selling by investment-grade-only mandates accelerated the bond spiral.

### USD bond prices (distressed)

| Bond | Price | Yield |
|------|-------|-------|
| 5.70% 2035 | 68.25 cents (-14.25 in one session) | 11.90% YTW |
| 6.95% 2054 | 62.875 cents (-30% in 2 days, Oct) | |
| 6.25% 2032 | Crashed 12 cents in one day | >14% (vs 6.5% at issuance) |
| 6.45% 2034 | ~86.7 cents (pre-Feb 9, likely lower now) | 8.7% |

### Why shareholders won't inject capital

- [[Shell]] (44%) — won't push above 50%; crossing that threshold forces [[IFRS]] consolidation of R$76.8B gross debt onto [[Shell]]'s balance sheet
- [[Cosan]] (44%) — raised R$10B in Sep 2025 (BTG R$4.5B, [[Perfin]] R$2B, Ometto R$750M) but explicitly ring-fenced from [[Raizen]]; [[Cosan]] shares fell 21%; 40-50% dilution to existing shareholders

### Restructuring advisers and options

| Party | Adviser |
|-------|---------|
| [[Raizen]] | [[Rothschild]], [[Citigroup]], [[Pinheiro Neto]], [[Cleary Gottlieb]] |
| [[Cosan]] | [[Itaú BBA]] |
| [[Shell]] | [[Lazard]] |

Options under discussion (all early stage):
- Debt haircut / restructuring
- Business carve-out (separating ethanol from fuel distribution)
- Equity offering
- Capital injection from [[Shell]]/[[Cosan]]/[[BTG Pactual]] (up to R$10B discussed)
- Stake sale to [[Mitsubishi]] (talks since Sep 2025; [[Mitsui]] also interested)

### Asset sales underway (~R$5B executed, R$15B target)

| Asset | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Argentina ops (Dock Sud refinery 101k bbl/day + ~700 stations) | >$1B | [[Mercuria Energy Group|Mercuria]] close to acquiring |
| Sao Paulo sugar plant (Leme) | R$425M | Sold |
| Santa Elisa mill shutdown | R$1.045B freed | Completed |
| Aviation fuel distribution unit | Up to $200M | Under evaluation |
| Mills reduced 30 → 24 | | Completed |

---

## CSN: parallel stress

[[CSN]] ([[CSN|Companhia Siderurgica Nacional]]) — [[Brazil]]'s largest integrated steel producer and major iron ore miner — running a parallel deleveraging playbook under CEO Benjamin Steinbruch.

### Financials and ratings

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue (2024) | ~R$44B |
| Net loss (2024) | R$1.5B (vs R$403M profit in 2023) |
| Net debt (Dec 2024) | R$35.7B |
| Leverage (Q3 2025) | 3.14x (company); 5.5x (Moody's adjusted) |
| FCF (Q3 2025) | Negative (R$-815M adjusted) |
| USD bonds outstanding | ~US$3.53B (62.5% BRL / 37.5% USD mix) |
| S&P rating | BB- (Dec 2024 downgrade from BB) |
| Moody's | Ba3, on review for downgrade (Nov 2025) |
| Fitch | BB- (RWN), downgrade from BB (Feb 2-3, 2026) |
| Target leverage | 1.0x via R$16-18B asset sales |
| Interest expense reduction target | R$1.5-1.8B/year |
| Dividend | Suspended (2025, first time in years) |

Fitch noted leverage consistent with B category and interest coverage at CCC category (1.25x). Benchmark 8.875% 2030 bond trading at 9.63% YTM, 587.5 bps Z-spread.

Peer comparison: [[Gerdau]] at 0.85x leverage, [[Usiminas]] at 0.16x — CSN is the only major Brazilian steelmaker with negative FCF and suspended dividends.

### Divestment plan (announced Jan 15, 2026)

| Asset | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| CSN Cimentos (cement) | Sell control | Signing targeted Q3/Q4 2026 |
| CSN Infra (railway + port) | Sell significant stake in Newco | Signing targeted Q3/Q4 2026 |
| Steel unit | Strategic review / partnerships | Ongoing |
| MRS stake (11%) | Already sold to CSN Mineracao for R$3.35B | Completed 2025 |

[[CSN Mineracao]] (CMIN3, iron ore) is not being divested — it's the crown jewel. 7th largest iron ore exporter globally, ~2.5B tonnes in reserves, volume guidance 43.5-47.5Mt for 2026, P15 expansion targeting 60-65Mt by 2030 (~R$4B/yr EBITDA contribution).

Steinbruch: "It's not because they're bad businesses or unprofitable. On the contrary. But waiting longer doesn't make sense."

## The 15% Selic squeeze: systemic corporate distress

The [[Raizen]]/[[CSN]] headlines are symptoms of a broader wave. The [[Selic]] went from 2% (Aug 2020) to 15% (Jun 2025) — pandemic-era debt taken at 2% is now refinancing at 15%. Average corporate loan rates are ~20.7% (up from 17.5% a year ago).

### Distress statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Selic]] rate | 15.00% — highest since 2006 |
| Avg corporate loan rate | 20.7%/year (Sep 2025, from 17.5%) |
| Avg individual lending rate | 36.3%/year (from 32.3%) |
| Companies with leverage >3.5x EBITDA | ~21% (end 2024) |
| Judicial recovery filings (2024) | 2,273 — record, +62% YoY (prev. record: 2016) |
| Extrajudicial reorganizations (2024) | R$31B restructured, +320% YoY |
| Bankruptcy decrees (2024) | 780 — +25% over 3 years |
| Farm bankruptcies (9M 2025) | 1,172 — tripled from 534 in 2023 |
| CNPJs with negative credit (Aug 2025) | 8.1M (from 6.9M a year prior) |
| System NPL ratio | 4.0% (Oct 2025) |
| System bank default ratio (excl. earmarked) | 5.4% (Dec 2025) |

### Most vulnerable sectors

- Agribusiness — hardest hit; farmer filings quintupled (426 in 9M 2024 vs ~80 prior year); sugar producers 18.6% distress rate; [[Banco do Brasil]] agri NPL surged to 5.34% (from 1.97%)
- Aviation — all three major carriers restructured: [[Azul]] (Chapter 11), [[Gol]] (judicial recovery), LATAM (prev.)
- Retail — [[Americanas]] (R$41B), [[Casas Bahia]] (R$4.1B extrajudicial), [[Marisa Lojas]] (mkt cap -71%)
- Petrochemicals — [[Braskem]] bonds crashed from 90 cents to low 30s; Fitch cut to CC; hired [[Lazard]] + [[Houlihan Lokey]]
- Steel/cement — [[CSN]] (R$35.7B net debt), [[InterCement]] (bankruptcy, failed CSN acquisition)
- Telecom — [[Oi]] (second judicial recovery)
- Utilities — [[Light SA]] (R$11B restructuring)

### High-profile distress cases

| Company | Sector | Status | Scale |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Americanas]] | Retail | Judicial recovery since Jan 2023; R$20B bank settlement Dec 2025 | R$41B debt |
| [[Azul]] | Aviation | Chapter 11 filed May 2025; plan approved Dec 2025 | >$2B debt cut; [[American Airlines]] + [[United Airlines|United]] equity |
| [[Gol]] | Aviation | Completed judicial recovery Jun 2025 | R$12B recap |
| [[Braskem]] | Petrochemicals | Restructuring; bonds at ~30 cents | Fitch CC |
| [[Ambipar]] | Waste mgmt | Judicial protection Sep 2025; shares R$26.85 → R$0.60 | Bonds at 13 cents |
| [[Raizen]] | Energy/biofuel | Restructuring talks | R$53.4B net debt; bonds at 75 cents |
| [[CSN]] | Steel/mining | Asset divestment program | R$35.7B net debt |
| [[Light SA]] | Utilities | Judicial recovery | R$11B debt |
| [[Oi]] | Telecom | Second judicial recovery / Ch. 11 conversion | |
| [[InterCement]] | Cement | Bankruptcy; Dutch subsidiary declared bankrupt | CSN takeover failed |
| [[Casas Bahia]] | Retail | Extrajudicial recovery Apr 2024 | R$4.1B restructured |
| [[Banco Master]] | Banking | Liquidated Jan 2026; CEO arrested | Contagion to [[Ambipar]], pension funds |

### Bank exposure

| Bank | Condition | Key metric |
|------|-----------|------------|
| [[Itaú Unibanco]] | Best positioned | NPL 2.3% (17-quarter low); corporate defaults 0.01%; ROE 22.5% |
| [[Bradesco]] | Recovering | Net income +39.3% YoY; closed 1,392 branches |
| [[Nubank]] | Strong | Net income R$11.4B (H1 2025), matching [[Bradesco]] |
| [[Banco do Brasil]] | Weak link | NPL surged to 4.93% (from 3.33%); agri NPL 5.34% (from 1.97%); R$12.73B overdue agri; suspended 2025 guidance |

Five banks took combined R$20B (US$3.6B) loss in the [[Americanas]] Dec 2025 settlement — [[Brazil]]'s largest ever.

### Historical comparison: 2015-16 Dilma crisis vs. now

| Dimension | 2015-16 | 2024-26 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Peak [[Selic]] | 14.25% | 15.00% |
| GDP | -3.5% (2015), -3.3% (2016) | Slowing (~2.2% → ~1.7%), no recession |
| Judicial recovery filings (peak) | Previous record | 2,273 in 2024 — surpassed 2016 |
| Sovereign rating | Downgraded to junk | BB stable (no junk downgrade) |
| Trigger | Commodity crash + Operation Car Wash + fiscal mismanagement | Pandemic debt at 2% refinancing at 15% + fiscal concerns |
| Unemployment | 7.8% → 13% | Less severe; labor market tighter |
| Key difference | Actual recession + sovereign junk | Higher corporate filings but no recession; the pain is concentrated in balance sheets |

Rate cuts expected from March 2026 (Focus consensus: [[Selic]] to ~12% by year-end; BofA: 11.25%; BBVA: 11.50%). But the damage is already locked into balance sheets — the R$100B+ debt maturity wall in 2025-2026 means many companies cannot wait for relief.

### Contagion channels

The distress is spreading through three channels beyond direct bondholder losses:

1. Primary market freeze — credit blowups are scuttling new corporate bond issuance. Companies scrapping or scaling down debt market plans because spreads have widened too far. This is the real contagion: healthy companies losing access to capital because distressed names have poisoned the market.

2. Structured product spillover — [[Ambipar]] and [[Braskem]] collapses triggered early maturity clauses in COEs (Structured Transaction Certificates) sold by [[XP Inc]] and [[BTG Pactual]]. Retail investors lost up to 93% of capital. Brokerage clients eating losses on structured products referencing credits they may not have understood.

3. Debt rollover ratio — Treasury debt rollovers running at ~140% of maturities (vs ~100% historical average). The government is crowding out corporate issuers by absorbing more capital market capacity, pushing corporate spreads wider.

[[Vontobel]]'s framing: the stress is Brazil-specific, not EM-systemic. Idiosyncratic triggers ([[Banco Master]] collapse → [[Ambipar]], Chinese overcapacity → [[Braskem]], [[Selic]] squeeze → [[Raizen]]/[[CSN]]) rather than a macro contagion chain. Brazilian corporate bonds returned -5.3% average vs -0.6% for EM benchmark — significant underperformance but contained to Brazil. They see selective opportunity in credits where operating performance is intact but bonds are trading at distressed levels due to market-wide risk aversion.

### Braskem update (Jan-Feb 2026)

[[Braskem]] bonds stabilized in the 60-cent range (up from low 30s in Sep 2025). Company made coupon payments on Jan 12 and Jan 23 (hybrid bonds), easing immediate default fears. But hired [[Lazard]], [[Cleary Gottlieb]], and Munhoz to review capital structure — action plan expected within 4-6 weeks. Still rated CC by Fitch. Chinese petrochemical overcapacity is the structural driver; [[Selic]] squeeze is the accelerant.

## Macro backdrop

### Fiscal position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Public debt/GDP (BCB official) | ~78% (Q3 2025), rising |
| Gross debt/GDP (IMF, broader) | ~88-91%, projected ~99% by 2030 |
| Federal public debt (end 2025) | >R$8.6T (record) |
| Projected federal debt (end 2026) | R$9.3-10.3T |
| Nominal deficit (12mo to Nov 2025) | R$1.03T (8.13% of GDP) |
| Primary deficit (12mo to Sep 2025) | R$33.2B (0.27% of GDP) |
| Annual interest expense | ~R$800B+ (~7.5% of GDP, ~31% of revenue) |
| 2025 tax collection | R$2.89T (record, +3.75% real) |
| Mandatory spending share of budget | ~92% |
| FX reserves | $330-360B (126% of IMF ARA metric, 16 months import cover) |

Record tax revenue cannot keep pace with spending — 92% of the budget is locked into mandatory expenses (pensions, salaries, health/education minimums). The nominal deficit (8.13% of GDP) dwarfs the primary deficit because interest payments alone consume R$800B+/year.

### Sovereign debt composition (2026 PAF targets)

| Component | Current | 2026 target range |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Selic-linked (floating) | 48.3% | 46-50% |
| Inflation-indexed (IPCA+) | 25.9% | 23-27% |
| Fixed-rate (LTN/NTN-F) | 22.0% | 21-25% |
| Exchange rate-linked | 3.8% | 3-7% |

The Treasury is reducing fixed-rate and increasing [[Selic]]-linked issuance — attractive to investors at 15%, but increases fiscal sensitivity to rate moves (every rate hike immediately increases debt service). ~96% of sovereign debt is BRL-denominated — not vulnerable to a classic EM dollar-debt crisis. Treasury buffer of R$1.187T covers 7.33 months of domestic maturities.

### Sovereign credit ratings

| Agency | Rating | Outlook | Last action |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Moody's | Ba1 | Stable | Outlook cut from positive to stable (May 30, 2025) |
| S&P | BB | Stable | Affirmed (Jun 2025) |
| Fitch | BB | Stable | Affirmed (Jun 25, 2025) |

Moody's had upgraded to Ba1 with positive outlook in Oct 2024 — the May 2025 reversal cited "pronounced deterioration in debt affordability." Path back to positive requires deeper spending reforms: reducing revenue earmarking, de-linking social benefits from minimum wage indexation, or social security reform. Fitch stressed [[Brazil]] must prove primary surpluses for an upgrade; 2026 election may delay fiscal resolution to 2027.

### International issuance

2025 was [[Brazil]]'s busiest year for sovereign bond sales since at least 2000 — ~$9.25B across four issuances:

| Date | Amount | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| Feb 2025 | $2.5B | 10-year dollar bond |
| Jun 2025 | $2.75B | Dollar bonds |
| Sep 2025 | $1.75B | $750M reopened 2030 notes (5.2% yield) + $1B new 2056 bonds (7.5%) |
| Nov 2025 | $2.25B | Including sustainable bonds ahead of COP30 |

2026 plans: multi-currency — dollars, euros, and yuan (panda bonds — a first for [[Brazil]], signaling deepening Brazil-China financial integration). Early Feb 2026 activity: dollar bonds maturing 2036 (~6.7% yield) and 2056 (~7.6%).

### 2026 election dynamics

| Candidate | Party | Positioning |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Lula da Silva (incumbent) | Workers' Party (PT) | Re-election; 48% approval (Quaest); populist fiscal, anti-financial-elite rhetoric |
| Tarcísio de Freitas | Republicanos | SP governor, market favorite; leads polls as centrist-right but may opt for governor re-election |
| Michelle Bolsonaro | PL | Strong among women/evangelicals; husband Jair barred (27-yr sentence) |
| Flávio Bolsonaro | PL | Declared pre-candidacy Dec 2025 |

Lula leads all runoff scenarios by ~12 points. Fiscal concern: advertising budget tripled, income tax exemption for <R$5,000/month earners, new subsidies. Market watches whether opposition consolidates behind a single candidate — a fragmented right likely means Lula wins and fiscal trajectory worsens.

The AEI framing: this is a "slow-burning crisis" — not a sudden stop or dollar shortage ([[Brazil]]'s sovereign debt is overwhelmingly BRL-denominated with adequate FX reserves), but a grinding fiscal erosion where debt service crowds out everything else. Comparisons drawn to the US fiscal trajectory.

## Sovereign CDS: contained so far

### Brazil historical

| Period | 5Y CDS (bps) | Context |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Early 2024 | ~130 | Pre-hiking cycle |
| Late 2025 | ~140 | Post-[[Selic]] peak, fiscal concerns |
| Jan 2026 | ~138-141 | Holding steady despite corporate distress |
| 52-wk range | 126-211 | |
| 2015-16 (Dilma crisis) | ~500+ | Actual sovereign stress |
| 2020 (COVID) | ~350 | EM panic |

### EM peer comparison (approx. early 2026)

| Country | 5Y CDS (bps) | Rating (Moody's) | Context |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| [[Mexico]] | ~80-90 | Baa2 | Investment grade, USMCA anchor |
| [[Colombia]] | ~130-140 | Baa2 (S&P BB+) | Mixed signals, 2026 election |
| [[Brazil]] | ~140 | Ba1 | Fiscal risk, election year |
| [[South Africa]] | ~150-170 | Ba2 | Load-shedding, GNU coalition |
| [[Turkey]] | ~222 | B1 | Political crisis, 46% rates |

[[Brazil]] trades roughly in line with [[Colombia]] despite being one notch lower at Moody's — market perceives [[Brazil]]'s fundamental credit profile (reserves, BRL-denominated debt, deep domestic capital markets) as stronger than the rating alone suggests.

At ~140 bps, the market is pricing moderate risk — not acute sovereign stress. EM credit spreads broadly at decade lows ([[Janus Henderson]]). The corporate bond rout has not yet spilled into sovereign CDS. 96% BRL-denominated debt and $330B+ FX reserves keep the sovereign insulated from corporate pain for now.

The key watch is whether the doom loop (corporate defaults → fiscal pressure → harder to cut rates → more defaults) starts moving the sovereign spread. The 52-week high of 211 bps shows the market has priced worse scenarios within the last year.

### The carry trade paradox

High rates attract foreign capital — non-residents added R$12B+ to Brazilian equities by late Jan 2026, and fixed-income carry flows remain strong (NTN-B real yields ~4.2%, vs sub-2% US real yields). BRL appreciated ~4% against USD in 2025. But the same 15% [[Selic]] that attracts carry simultaneously worsens the fiscal math (~R$800B/yr in interest). This is the core tension: the carry trade sustains short-term demand for Brazilian assets while the underlying fiscal position deteriorates.

---

## Investment implications

| Implication | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Contagion risk | If [[Raizen]] restructures, bondholders take haircuts → risk repricing across Brazilian corporates |
| Energy transition setback | [[Raizen]] was the poster child for Brazilian biofuel; junk status signals the sector can't self-fund at 15% rates |
| Rate sensitivity | When [[Selic]] eventually cuts (Focus consensus: ~12% by year-end), these names re-rate fastest — but timing uncertain |
| Sovereign spillover | More corporate distress → more fiscal pressure → harder to cut rates → doom loop risk |
| Restructuring boom | [[Houlihan Lokey]], [[Moelis]] expanded Brazil teams in 2023 anticipating this; advisory fees flowing |
| Japanese strategic interest | [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Mitsui]] interested in [[Raizen]] stake — biofuel supply chain play at distressed entry |
| [[CSN Mineracao]] as hidden value | Not being sold; P15 expansion could drive R$4B/yr EBITDA by 2030; parent's distress creates entry point |
| Election catalyst | Opposition consolidation behind Tarcísio could reprice fiscal trajectory; fragmented right = more Lula spending |
