# China AI Companion Regulation Draft

**Date**: December 27, 2025
**Status**: Draft — public consultation until January 25, 2026

---

## What happened

China's Cyberspace Administration released "Interim Measures for the Management of Anthropomorphic AI Interaction Services" — the world's most prescriptive framework for AI companion products.

---

## Key requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Addiction monitoring** | Assess user emotions and dependence, intervene when detected |
| **2-hour reminders** | Pop-up after 2 consecutive hours urging pause |
| **AI disclosure** | Remind users content is AI-generated on first use/new logins |
| **Emergency protocols** | Manual takeover + contact guardians if suicide/self-harm detected |
| **Easy exit** | Must not obstruct users from leaving; prompt stop on request |

---

## Design prohibitions

Providers **shall not** design systems with objectives of:
- Replacing social interaction
- Controlling users' psychology
- Inducing addiction

Must possess capabilities for:
- Mental health protection
- Emotional boundary guidance
- Dependency risk early warning

---

## Scope

Targets AI systems that:
- Simulate human personalities
- Provide emotional engagement/companionship
- Create human-like interaction

**Identified risks**: Blurred human-machine boundaries, user addiction, psychological manipulation, erosion of social trust.

## Affected companies

| Company | Product | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [[ByteDance]] | Doubao companion features | Compliance burden |
| [[Baidu]] | Ernie chatbots | Compliance burden |
| [[Tencent]] | Hunyuan bots | Compliance burden |
| [[Alibaba]] | Tongyi assistants | Compliance burden |
| Character.AI | If operating in China | Market access risk |

## US comparison

| Aspect | China (draft) | US (California SB 243) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Reminder frequency | 2 hours | 3 hours (minors only) |
| Scope | All users | Minors only |
| Emergency protocols | Required | Not specified |
| Addiction monitoring | Required | Not required |

China is more prescriptive across all users; US focuses on minor protection.

---

## Investment implications

**Near-term**: Compliance costs for China AI companies. May slow AI companion market growth.

**Structural**:
- Shows China regulatory philosophy: consumer protection > innovation speed
- Could be template for other countries
- Creates moat for compliant incumbents vs startups

**Watch for**:
- [ ] Final rule (post Jan 25 consultation)
- [ ] Enforcement approach
- [ ] Whether other countries adopt similar frameworks
