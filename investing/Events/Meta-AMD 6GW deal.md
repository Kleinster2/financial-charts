**Meta-AMD 6GW deal (Feb 24, 2026)** — [[Meta]] commits to deploying up to 6 gigawatts of [[AMD]] Instinct GPUs across its AI data centers, with performance-based warrants giving Meta ~10% of AMD equity.

## Deal terms

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | Feb 24, 2026 (OCP Global Summit) |
| Scope | Up to 6GW of AMD Instinct GPUs |
| First shipments | H2 2026 — custom MI450 in [[Helios]] rack-scale servers |
| CPUs included | AI-optimized [[EPYC]] CPUs |
| Warrant | 160M AMD shares (~10% of company) |
| Warrant vesting | Tranche-based: 1st tranche at 1GW shipped, subsequent at milestones to 6GW |
| Additional triggers | AMD stock price thresholds + technical/commercial milestones |

## Context

Comes **one week after** Meta committed to deploying millions of [[NVIDIA]] GPUs (Feb 17, 2026) — a clear diversification play. Meta is hedging its AI compute supply across both major GPU vendors.

Meta's capex context:
- **$135B capex** committed for 2026
- **30 data centers** planned (26 in US)
- Open-source AI leader ([[Llama]]) needing massive inference + training capacity

## Warrant structure

Identical playbook to [[AMD]]'s October 2025 deal with [[OpenAI]] — also 160M shares with deployment-linked vesting. AMD is now running a standardized "equity-for-volume" structure with its largest customers.

This mirrors the [[Amazon commercial warrants]] pattern: equity tied to commercial commitments, ensuring alignment between supplier and customer. Key difference: AMD is the *supplier* granting warrants to *buyers*, whereas Amazon typically receives warrants from suppliers.

**Why it works for AMD:**
- Locks in massive committed volume from top-2 AI hyperscaler
- Warrants only vest if AMD actually delivers at scale — no free equity
- Validates AMD as credible #2 to NVIDIA in AI GPUs
- [[Lisa Su]] called it one of the "most transformational deals" for AMD

**Why it works for Meta:**
- Diversifies away from pure NVIDIA dependence
- Gets ~10% of AMD upside if AMD succeeds (aligned incentives)
- Controls full stack — can use whoever's compute it wants

## Market reaction (Feb 24)

| Ticker | Move |
|--------|------|
| AMD | **+7%** |
| META | Slightly lower |
| NVDA | Flat |

Analyst Ben Bajarin (Creative Strategies): *"Meta is in a unique position to control the full stack and they can use whoever's compute they want. It's just a punctuation point on the fact that we are compute constrained, and deals will be done across the board."*

## Significance

This is AMD's second major hyperscaler deal using the equity-for-volume template (after [[OpenAI]]). If AMD executes — delivering MI450/Helios at scale — it establishes a genuine two-vendor market for AI GPUs, breaking [[NVIDIA]]'s ~90% monopoly.

The 6GW figure is enormous. For context, AMD's entire data center revenue in Q4 2025 was $5.4B. This deal alone could represent tens of billions over its lifetime.
