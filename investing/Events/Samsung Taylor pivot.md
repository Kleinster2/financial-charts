**Date**: Mid-2024 pivot announcement (originally announced 2021)

## What happened

[[Samsung]] pivoted its Taylor, Texas fab from **4nm to 2nm** mid-construction.

## Timeline

- **2021**: Announced as $17B project targeting 4nm, mass production 2024
- **Mid-2024**: Pivoted to 2nm to capture AI demand and qualify for [[CHIPS Act]]
- **June 2024, mid-2025**: Construction halts reported
- **2026-2027**: Revised target for mass production

## Why it matters

This is the defining test case for [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]].

**Bull case**: First U.S. 2nm mass production, captures geopolitically-constrained customers

**Bear case**: Self-inflicted wound that widens the [[TSMC]] gap permanently

## Key numbers

| Metric | Original | Current |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Budget | $17B | $44-50B |
| Node | 4nm | 2nm |
| Timeline | 2024 | 2026-2027 |
| Yields | — | 55-60% (from 10-20%) |

## What to watch

- [ ] Yields reach 70%+ by mid-2026
- [ ] Major customer win beyond [[Tesla]]
- [ ] Cost per wafer vs [[TSMC Arizona expansion]]
