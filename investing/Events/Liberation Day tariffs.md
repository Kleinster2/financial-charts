# Liberation Day tariffs

On April 2, 2025 — dubbed "Liberation Day" by the Trump administration — the United States announced sweeping tariff increases against the European Union, triggering the most significant transatlantic trade confrontation in decades.

## What happened

**Date:** April 2, 2025

The Trump administration announced dramatically elevated tariffs on EU imports, framing the action as "liberating" American industry from unfair trade practices.

The announcement followed months of trade rhetoric and preceded intense negotiations that led to the [[Turnberry Agreement]] in July.

## Why it matters

**Immediate impact:**
- Shocked European markets
- Triggered EU retaliation planning
- Forced EU into asymmetric Turnberry deal (July 2025)

**Longer-term implications:**
- Established pattern of US economic coercion against allies
- Paralyzed WTO dispute settlement (EU couldn't challenge effectively)
- Set precedent for linking unrelated issues (later: Greenland annexation)

**Name significance:** "Liberation Day" framing echoed Trump's view that trade deficits represent foreign exploitation of the US — a departure from post-WWII free trade consensus.
