# COMPAS Mexico plant sale 2026

[[BYD]], [[Geely]], and [[VinFast]] are finalists to acquire the 230,000-unit COMPAS factory in [[Aguascalientes]], [[Mexico]] — a $1B [[Nissan]]-[[Mercedes-Benz]] joint venture plant closing May 2026. First major Chinese automaker bid for an existing North American factory.

## The plant

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Name | COMPAS (Cooperation Manufacturing Plant Aguascalientes) |
| Location | Aguascalientes, [[Mexico]] |
| Opened | 2017 |
| Original cost | $1B |
| Capacity | 230,000 vehicles/year |
| Current models | [[Infiniti]] QX50, QX55; [[Mercedes-Benz]] GLB |
| Closing | May 2026 |
| Direct jobs affected | ~3,600 |
| Owners | Joint venture: Daimler ([[Mercedes-Benz]]) + [[Renault]]-[[Nissan]] Alliance |

## Why it's closing

Multiple converging factors:

1. [[Mercedes-Benz]] moving GLB production to [[Hungary]] (Kecskemét plant) — primarily a cost play. Hungary production costs less than half of Germany's. Mercedes already makes compacts there, so adding electric GLB is consolidation. Majority of GLB sales are European, not US — shorter supply chains within EU. Both EU and Mexico face 25% US auto tariffs, so no tariff arbitrage
2. [[Nissan]] canceling slow-selling Infiniti QX50/QX55 models as part of global restructuring
3. [[Nissan]] also closing a second factory near Mexico City
4. US tariffs — Trump's 25% blanket tariff on Mexican imports was the final nail

## The bidders

Three finalists selected from nine initial expressions of interest:

| Bidder | Country | Strategic rationale |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| [[BYD]] | [[China]] | Instant North American manufacturing footprint; bypasses years of greenfield red tape |
| [[Geely]] | [[China]] | Complements [[Volvo Cars]] South Carolina plant; multi-brand production base |
| [[VinFast]] | [[Vietnam]] | North American production for US-market EVs |

Also-rans: [[Chery]], [[Great Wall Motor]] among the nine that expressed interest.

## Political dynamics

Mexico:
- Economy ministry quietly urged [[Aguascalientes]] state authorities to stall Chinese automaker investments until US trade talks conclude
- Mexico cannot legally block a private factory sale
- BYD previously planned a greenfield Mexico factory but abandoned it due to regulatory red tape
- China's commerce ministry delayed BYD's greenfield approval in Mar 2025, citing tech leakage concerns near US R&D

US:
- 25% tariffs on Mexican auto imports already pressuring the sector
- 100%+ tariffs on Chinese-made EVs block direct imports
- Acquiring an existing plant requires no Mexican government approval — faster than building new

[[China]]:
- Commerce ministry aware of automaker interest, no objections raised
- Chinese OEMs need Beijing approval for overseas factory investments

---

## Strategic significance

For Chinese automakers:
- Chinese brands went from 0% to ~10% of Mexico's ~1.5M annual car market since 2020
- An operating factory with 230K capacity = instant North American production base
- Potential pathway to US market via [[USMCA]] — though Congress could close this loophole

For the [[Chinese EVs enter US]] thesis:
- This is the Mexico manufacturing pathway (Pathway #3) materializing in real time
- An existing plant is faster than greenfield — production could restart within months of closing
- 3,600 jobs restored = strong political narrative for Mexican government

For [[Mexico]]:
- Tests Sheinbaum administration's balancing act between US pressure and Chinese investment
- FDI is critical (record $41B in 2025) but Chinese investment remains politically sensitive
