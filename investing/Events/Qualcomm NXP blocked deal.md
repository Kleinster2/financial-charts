**Qualcomm NXP blocked deal (2018)** — China blocked Qualcomm's $44B acquisition of NXP by withholding antitrust approval during US-China trade war. Landmark example of [[Weaponized antitrust]].

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 2016 | Qualcomm announces $38B bid for NXP |
| 2017 | Price raised to $44B after activist pressure |

## Why China blocked it

Official: Competition concerns in NFC, automotive
Actual: Leverage during trade war

- Trump had just imposed tariffs on China
- ZTE sanctions were active
- China demonstrated it could veto US semiconductor consolidation
- No formal rejection — just ran out the clock

---

## Implications

### For semiconductors
- US realized strategic vulnerability
- Contributed to [[CHIPS Act]] rationale
- Showed China as gatekeeper for global M&A

### For Qualcomm
- Lost automotive/IoT diversification
- $2B breakup fee
- Remained dependent on mobile (Apple risk)
- See [[Qualcomm]]

### For NXP
- Remained independent
- Stock dropped 8% on deal death
- Later recovered as standalone
- See [[NXP]]

### For geopolitics
- Precedent: China can block Western consolidation
- Accelerated US-China tech decoupling
- See [[Weaponized antitrust]]

## Counterfactual

If approved, Qualcomm-NXP would have been:
- #1 in automotive semiconductors
- Dominant in NFC/secure elements
- Diversified away from mobile modem risk
- Potentially less vulnerable to Apple's modem efforts
