## What happened

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | Late 2024 |
| Deal value | **$2.7B** |
| Total debt post-deal | **$5B** |
| Amazon investment | $475M equity stake |

**Structure:**
- Saks (owned by [[Richard Baker]] / HBC) acquired Neiman Marcus
- [[Amazon]] invested $475M for minority equity stake
- Combined entity named "Saks Global"
- Financed with $2.2B new junk bonds + assumed Neiman legacy debt

---

## Why it happened

**Strategic rationale:**
- Consolidate luxury department store market
- Combine customer databases and loyalty programs
- Reduce overhead through shared operations
- Create negotiating leverage with luxury brands

**Richard Baker's thesis:** Scale would create a survivor in declining department store industry.

## The debt problem

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| New junk bonds | $2.2B |
| Neiman legacy debt | ~$2.8B (from Apollo/PE era) |
| Asset-based lending | $1.8B facility |
| **Total obligations** | **$5B** |

**Hidden bomb:** Neiman came with legacy debt from [[Neiman Marcus bankruptcy 2020]] restructuring. Saks assumed this burden.

**Interest expense:**
- Pre-deal: $234M/year
- Post-deal: ~$400M/year (+70%)

---

## Why it matters

**The deal killed both companies:**
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly enough
- Interest costs consumed cash flow
- Rising rates made debt more expensive
- Luxury sales softened in 2025
- Led directly to [[Saks bankruptcy]] (Jan 2026)

**Moody's (Mickey Chadha):** "Recipe for disaster."

**Morningstar (David Swartz):** "This Saks-Neiman merger has been a disaster."
