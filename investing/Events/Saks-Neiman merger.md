## What happened

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | Late 2024 |
| Deal value | **$2.7B** |
| Total debt post-deal | **$5B** |
| Amazon investment | $475M equity stake |

**Structure:**
- Saks (owned by [[Richard Baker]] / HBC) acquired Neiman Marcus
- [[Amazon]] invested $475M for **23% minority equity stake**
- Combined entity named "Saks Global"
- Financed with $2.2B new junk bonds + assumed Neiman legacy debt

### Amazon's deal terms

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Investment | $475M preferred equity |
| Stake | 23% of combined entity |
| Commercial agreement | "Saks on Amazon" platform |
| Guaranteed fees | **$900M over 8 years** |
| Consent rights | Approval over new financing under LLC agreement |
| Collateral | Deal secured by Fifth Avenue flagship |

**The Amazon partnership:**
- Saks would sell products on Amazon's website
- Amazon would provide technology and logistics expertise
- Amazon had approval rights over any financing that encumbered the flagship holding company
- Flagship real estate (appraised at **$3.6B** in March 2024) backed Amazon's investment

**What went wrong:**
- "Saks on Amazon" platform never launched
- Saks allegedly "failed to abide by the conditions of the investment"
- In August 2024, Saks raised $600M from bondholders using flagship as collateral — **without Amazon's consent**
- Amazon later called its $475M stake "presumptively worthless"

## Why it happened

**Strategic rationale:**
- Consolidate luxury department store market
- Combine customer databases and loyalty programs
- Reduce overhead through shared operations
- Create negotiating leverage with luxury brands

**Richard Baker's thesis:** Scale would create a survivor in declining department store industry.

## The debt problem

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| New junk bonds | $2.2B |
| Neiman legacy debt | ~$2.8B (from [[Apollo]]/PE era) |
| Asset-based lending | $1.8B facility |
| **Total obligations** | **$5B** |

**Hidden bomb:** Neiman came with legacy debt from [[Neiman Marcus bankruptcy 2020]] restructuring. Saks assumed this burden.

**Interest expense:**
- Pre-deal: $234M/year
- Post-deal: ~$400M/year (+70%)

---

## Why it matters

**The deal killed both companies:**
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly enough
- Interest costs consumed cash flow
- Rising rates made debt more expensive
- [[Luxury]] sales softened in 2025
- Led directly to [[Saks bankruptcy]] (Jan 2026)

**[[Moody's]] (Mickey Chadha):** "Recipe for disaster."

**[[Morningstar]] (David Swartz):** "This Saks-Neiman merger has been a disaster."
