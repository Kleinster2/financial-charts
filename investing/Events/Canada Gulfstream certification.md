**Canada Gulfstream certification** — Transport Canada certifies [[General Dynamics]]' Gulfstream G500/G600 business jets after Trump threatens to decertify all Canadian-built aircraft, Feb 2026.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 30, 2026 | [[Donald Trump]] posts on social media threatening to decertify [[Bombardier]] jets and all Canadian-made aircraft unless [[Canada]] certifies four Gulfstream models. Threatens 50% import tariff. |
| Early Feb 2026 | [[Bombardier]] stock drops ~6% on the threat, then recovers as de-escalation signals emerge |
| Feb 15, 2026 | Transport Canada issues type certificates for Gulfstream G500 and G600 |
| Feb 20, 2026 | Certification disclosed publicly via government document |

## What was certified

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gulfstream G500 | Certified (Feb 15) |
| Gulfstream G600 | Certified (Feb 15) |
| Gulfstream G700 | Pending — fuel-system icing concern |
| Gulfstream G800 | Pending — fuel-system icing concern |

The [[FAA]] and [[EASA]] had already certified G700/G800 with a temporary exemption (valid through end-2026) to allow additional de-icing testing. Transport Canada held to stricter standards.

## The protectionism angle

[[Bombardier]]'s Global Express and Challenger business jets compete directly with Gulfstream. The allegation: Canada was slow-walking Gulfstream certification to protect its domestic manufacturer. Trump called Canada's stance "wrongful" and "illegal."

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the agency wanted "a level playing field," questioning whether other countries applied equivalent resources to certifying US products.

## Trump's leverage mechanism

Classic tariff-threat coercion:
1. Threaten to decertify [[Bombardier]] jets (Canadian-built) in the US
2. Threaten 50% import tariff on Canadian aircraft
3. Force Canada's hand on competitor product ([[General Dynamics]] Gulfstream)

This mirrors the pattern seen in auto tariffs, [[USMCA]] renegotiation, and other bilateral pressure campaigns under [[Trump II]].

## What's still open

- G700 and G800 certification pending — Transport Minister's office says discussions with FAA continue
- De-icing technical issue unresolved for those models
- Broader question of whether Canada will face further pressure on other US product certifications
