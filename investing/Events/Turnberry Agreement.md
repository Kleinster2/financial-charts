# Turnberry Agreement

On July 27, 2025, the United States and European Union signed an asymmetric trade agreement that reduced tensions from [[Liberation Day tariffs]] but required the EU to accept deeply unfavorable terms — 15% US tariffs on EU goods vs. 0% EU tariffs on US goods.

## What happened

**Date:** July 27, 2025

Following the April "Liberation Day" tariff shock, the EU negotiated a deal to limit damage. The resulting Turnberry Agreement:

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| US tariffs on EU imports | 15% |
| EU tariffs on US imports | 0% |
| WTO compliance | No — violates Most Favored Nation principle |
| EU Parliament status | Under review |

**Why EU accepted:** Faced with even higher tariffs and no functional WTO dispute settlement, the EU chose an asymmetric deal over escalation.

---

## Why it matters

**Precedent-setting:**
- First major trade deal explicitly outside WTO framework
- Demonstrated US willingness to coerce allies economically
- Showed EU vulnerability when WTO cannot enforce rules

**Instability:**
- Not ratified by European Parliament (still under review as of Jan 2026)
- **Frozen by EU** in January 2026 in response to Trump's Greenland annexation push
- EU preparing €93B retaliation list if deal collapses

**WTO implications:**
- Agreement violates MFN (Most Favored Nation) principle
- Neither side pursued WTO challenge — system effectively bypassed
- Further marginalized multilateral trade rules

---

## Current status (Jan 2026)

**Frozen.** EU suspended implementation in response to:
- Trump's Greenland annexation threats
- Threatened 10% tariffs (Feb 1) → 25% (Jun 1) on 6 EU countries + Norway + [[UK]]

EU now considering:
- Reactivating €93B retaliation list ([[Boeing]], soy, whiskey, motorcycles)
- Activating Anti-Coercion Instrument (2023, never used) for broader measures

## Actors involved

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| [[US Government]] | Imposed asymmetric terms |
| [[EU]] | Accepted under pressure; now frozen |
| [[WTO]] | Bypassed |
