---

## Political context

**Beneficiary of [[Trump II]] Deregulation:**
*   **Permitting:** Prime candidate for fast-tracked NEPA review and streamlined environmental approvals.
*   **Power:** Likely test case for [[Nuclear renaissance]] regulatory reforms (NRC licensing speed).
*   **DOGE Influence:** Unofficial advisement from [[Elon Musk]]/[[DOGE]] on cutting red tape to ensure US leads the "Sovereign AI" race against [[China]].

## What they're building

| Component | Scale |
|-----------|-------|
| Data centers | 10+ hyperscale facilities |
| Compute | Millions of GPUs |
| Power | Gigawatts of capacity |
| Geography | Global expansion |

**First site**: Under construction near Abilene, Texas.

**Status (Jan 2026):** Per SemiAnalysis, Abilene "not going BRRR" — progressing slower than OpenAI's UAE Stargate site which uses on-site gas turbines ([[BYOP]]).

---

## Status (Jan 2026) — approaching 1-year anniversary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Planned capacity | **7 GW** |
| Capital committed | **$400B** of $500B target |
| US sites | 5 new (Sep 2025) + original Texas |
| Global expansion | UAE (1GW), Norway (230MW), [[UK]], Argentina |

**US sites (announced Sep 2025):**
- Shackelford County, Texas
- Dona Ana County, New [[Mexico]]
- Lordstown, Ohio
- Milam County, Texas
- Undisclosed midwestern location

**Energy commitments (Jan 21, 2026):**
- OpenAI pledges to "pay our own way" — fund grid upgrades and extra generating capacity
- AI campuses as "flexible loads" — curtail consumption during peak demand
- Won't cause hikes in electricity prices for local communities
- Minimize water use, protect local ecosystems

**Community opposition:** 20 US data center projects blocked/delayed during Q2 2025 alone. Abilene facing complaints about noise, water, energy consumption, lack of long-term local jobs.

**Personnel:** George Osborne (former [[UK]] Chancellor) hired to run "OpenAI for Countries" — exporting Stargate model globally.

## Global expansion

| Location | Investment | Capacity | Partner | Status |
|----------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Texas, USA** | Part of $500B | Multiple GW | Oracle | Under construction |
| **Stargate UAE** | Part of $500B | **1 GW** | [[G42]], Oracle, NVIDIA, [[Cisco]], [[SoftBank]] | 200MW by 2026 |
| **Stargate Norway** | TBD | **230 MW** | TBD | Narvik, hydropower |
| **Stargate [[UK]]** | TBD | 8K→31K GPUs | NVIDIA, [[Nscale]] | Early 2026 start |
| **Argentina** | $25B | 500MW | Sur Energy | LOI signed (Oct 2025) |
| **South Korea** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |
| **[[Germany]]** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |

### Stargate Argentina

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Investment | $25B |
| Location | Patagonia |
| Capacity | 500MW (largest in [[LATAM]]) |
| Partner | Sur Energy |
| Timeline | Construction 2026, first 100MW in 2027 |
| Incentives | RIGI program (tax breaks, FX benefits) |

Argentina offers: cheap energy, Milei government support, RIGI incentives for $200M+ investments.

## Why $500B

The scale reflects:

| Driver | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| AGI race | OpenAI needs massive compute for frontier models |
| Inference scaling | [[Inference disaggregation]] requires more hardware |
| Sovereign competition | US vs [[China]] AI infrastructure race |
| Power constraints | Must secure energy before building |

---

## Chip implications

| Supplier | Role |
|----------|------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Primary GPU supplier (H100/H200/Blackwell) |
| [[Broadcom]] | Networking, potential custom ASICs |
| [[AMD]] | Secondary GPU supplier |
| Custom silicon | OpenAI ASIC development |

**[[NVIDIA as kingmaker]]**: Stargate likely represents largest single GPU order in history.

---

## Power requirements

| Challenge | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Gigawatt-scale demand | [[Nuclear power for AI]], natural gas, solar |
| Grid constraints | Texas ERCOT flexibility |
| Timeline | Power must precede compute |

See [[Power constraints]] for broader context.

---

## Memory demand

Stargate will consume massive [[HBM]]:

| Impact | Beneficiary |
|--------|-------------|
| [[HBM]] demand surge | [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]] |
| Supply tightening | Extends [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] |
| Pricing power | Korean memory makers |

**Samsung/SK Hynix Stargate commitment (Jan 2026):**
- 900K DRAM wafers/month dedicated to Stargate
- HBM4 mass production: **February 2026**
- Yongin cluster → world's largest [[HBM]] production hub by 2027

Reinforces [[Long memory]] thesis.

---

## Skepticism

| Concern | Counter |
|---------|---------|
| $500B is aspirational, not committed | $100B initial is real |
| [[SoftBank]] track record (WeWork, etc.) | Different: infrastructure, not startups |
| Power availability | Texas is most flexible US grid |
| OpenAI governance issues | [[Sam Altman]] survived board crisis |
| Political risk | Bipartisan AI infrastructure support |

---

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Jan 21, 2025 | White House announcement |
| Q1 2025 | Texas site construction begins |
| Sep 2025 | 5 new US sites announced |
| Jan 2026 | Energy/community commitments announced |
| Feb 2026 | HBM4 production begins (Samsung/SK Hynix) |
| 2026 | UAE Stargate 200MW, [[UK]] first GPUs |
| 2026-2028 | 7GW buildout target |
| 2029 | $500B deployment target |

---

## Investment implications

**Direct beneficiaries:**

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | GPU supplier |
| [[Oracle]] | JV partner, cloud |
| [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]] | [[HBM]] demand |
| [[Broadcom]] | Networking |
| Texas utilities | Power demand |

**Indirect beneficiaries:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cooling | [[Vertiv]], [[Modine Manufacturing]] |
| Power infrastructure | [[GE Vernova]], transformers |
| Construction | Data center builders |
| Real estate | Texas land near grid capacity |

---

## Competitive response

| Player | Likely response |
|--------|-----------------|
| [[Google]] | Accelerate TPU deployment |
| [[Microsoft]] | Expand Azure AI capacity |
| [[Amazon]] | Expand Trainium/AWS |
| [[Meta]] | Build more GPU clusters |
| [[China]] | Accelerate domestic AI infra |

Stargate forces all hyperscalers to respond.

---

## For theses

**[[Long NVIDIA]]**: Stargate is massive GPU order — platform dominance reinforced.

**[[Long memory]]**: [[HBM]] demand extends shortage timeline.

**[[Long inference stack]]**: Infrastructure buildout benefits entire stack.
