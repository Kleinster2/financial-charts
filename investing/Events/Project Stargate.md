**Project Stargate** — $500B AI infrastructure joint venture. OpenAI + SoftBank + Oracle. Announced January 2025. Largest AI infrastructure commitment in history.

---

## The deal

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total commitment | $500B over 4 years |
| Initial investment | $100B |
| Announced | January 21, 2025 |
| Location | Texas (initial), expanding US |
| Structure | Joint venture |

---

## The partners

| Partner | Role | Commitment |
|---------|------|------------|
| [[OpenAI]] | Technology, AI models | Anchor tenant |
| [[Masayoshi Son]] / SoftBank | Lead investor, chairman | $40B+ |
| [[Oracle]] | Cloud infrastructure | Data center expertise |
| MGX (UAE) | Co-investor | Sovereign wealth |

**Notable**: Announced at White House with Trump administration endorsement.

---

## Political context

**Beneficiary of [[Trump II]] Deregulation:**
*   **Permitting:** Prime candidate for fast-tracked NEPA review and streamlined environmental approvals.
*   **Power:** Likely test case for [[Nuclear renaissance]] regulatory reforms (NRC licensing speed).
*   **DOGE Influence:** Unofficial advisement from [[Elon Musk]]/[[DOGE]] on cutting red tape to ensure US leads the "Sovereign AI" race against China.

## What they're building

| Component | Scale |
|-----------|-------|
| Data centers | 10+ hyperscale facilities |
| Compute | Millions of GPUs |
| Power | Gigawatts of capacity |
| Geography | Global expansion |

**First site**: Under construction near Abilene, Texas.

**Status (Jan 2026):** Per SemiAnalysis, Abilene "not going BRRR" — progressing slower than OpenAI's UAE Stargate site which uses on-site gas turbines ([[BYOP]]).

---

## Global expansion

Stargate has expanded beyond Texas to multiple countries:

| Location | Investment | Capacity | Partner | Status |
|----------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Texas, USA** | Part of $500B | Multiple GW | Oracle | Under construction |
| **Argentina** | $25B | 500MW | Sur Energy | LOI signed (Oct 2025) |
| **UK** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |
| **Norway** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |
| **South Korea** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |
| **Germany** | TBD | TBD | TBD | In progress |

### Stargate Argentina

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Investment | $25B |
| Location | Patagonia |
| Capacity | 500MW (largest in LATAM) |
| Partner | Sur Energy |
| Timeline | Construction 2026, first 100MW in 2027 |
| Incentives | RIGI program (tax breaks, FX benefits) |

Argentina offers: cheap energy, Milei government support, RIGI incentives for $200M+ investments.

## Why $500B

The scale reflects:

| Driver | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| AGI race | OpenAI needs massive compute for frontier models |
| Inference scaling | [[Inference disaggregation]] requires more hardware |
| Sovereign competition | US vs China AI infrastructure race |
| Power constraints | Must secure energy before building |

---

## Chip implications

| Supplier | Role |
|----------|------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Primary GPU supplier (H100/H200/Blackwell) |
| [[Broadcom]] | Networking, potential custom ASICs |
| [[AMD]] | Secondary GPU supplier |
| Custom silicon | OpenAI ASIC development |

**NVIDIA as kingmaker**: Stargate likely represents largest single GPU order in history.

---

## Power requirements

| Challenge | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Gigawatt-scale demand | [[Nuclear power for AI]], natural gas, solar |
| Grid constraints | Texas ERCOT flexibility |
| Timeline | Power must precede compute |

See [[Power constraints]] for broader context.

---

## Memory demand

Stargate will consume massive HBM:

| Impact | Beneficiary |
|--------|-------------|
| HBM demand surge | [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]] |
| Supply tightening | Extends [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] |
| Pricing power | Korean memory makers |

Reinforces [[Long memory]] thesis.

---

## Skepticism

| Concern | Counter |
|---------|---------|
| $500B is aspirational, not committed | $100B initial is real |
| SoftBank track record (WeWork, etc.) | Different: infrastructure, not startups |
| Power availability | Texas is most flexible US grid |
| OpenAI governance issues | Sam Altman survived board crisis |
| Political risk | Bipartisan AI infrastructure support |

---

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Jan 21, 2025 | White House announcement |
| Q1 2025 | Texas site construction begins |
| 2025-2026 | First data centers operational |
| 2025-2029 | $500B deployment target |

---

## Investment implications

**Direct beneficiaries:**

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | GPU supplier |
| [[Oracle]] | JV partner, cloud |
| [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]] | HBM demand |
| [[Broadcom]] | Networking |
| Texas utilities | Power demand |

**Indirect beneficiaries:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cooling | [[Vertiv]], [[Modine Manufacturing]] |
| Power infrastructure | [[GE Vernova]], transformers |
| Construction | Data center builders |
| Real estate | Texas land near grid capacity |

---

## Competitive response

| Player | Likely response |
|--------|-----------------|
| [[Google]] | Accelerate TPU deployment |
| [[Microsoft]] | Expand Azure AI capacity |
| [[Amazon]] | Expand Trainium/AWS |
| [[Meta]] | Build more GPU clusters |
| China | Accelerate domestic AI infra |

Stargate forces all hyperscalers to respond.

---

## For theses

**[[Long NVIDIA]]**: Stargate is massive GPU order — platform dominance reinforced.

**[[Long memory]]**: HBM demand extends shortage timeline.

**[[Long inference stack]]**: Infrastructure buildout benefits entire stack.
