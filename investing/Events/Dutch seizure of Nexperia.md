**Dutch seizure of Nexperia (October 2025)** — Netherlands invoked 1952 emergency law to take control of Chinese-owned chipmaker [[Nexperia]], citing national security. First Western nationalization of a Chinese semiconductor asset.

## Legal mechanism

Netherlands used the **Goods Availability Act (1952)** — Cold War-era law designed to safeguard industries vital to national interest. First time ever invoked for semiconductors.

Order covers:
- Nexperia BV and 30 global subsidiaries
- Freeze on asset transfers, IP, personnel changes
- Valid for one year

---

## Stated reasons

Dutch government cited:
- "Serious governance shortcomings"
- Technology transfer to [[China]]
- Threat to "crucial technological knowledge and capabilities"
- Risk to European automotive supply chains

CEO Zhang Xuezheng suspended; CFO Stefan Tilger appointed interim.

## [[China]]'s response

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for the broader pattern.

1. **Export controls**: Blocked Nexperia from exporting components from [[China]]
2. **Rare earth controls**: Tightened restrictions (Oct 9) — see [[Rare earth leverage]]
3. **Diplomatic protest**: Called it "geopolitical bias" and "excessive intervention"
4. **Market reaction**: Wingtech shares -10% in Shanghai

## Why it matters

### Precedent-setting
- First Western nationalization of Chinese semiconductor asset
- Template for future [[EU]] interventions
- Escalation beyond [[Export controls]] to direct seizure

### Supply chain impact
- Nexperia supplies automotive discretes to European OEMs
- [[China]] controls Nexperia's Asian manufacturing
- Risk of tit-for-tat disruptions

### Connects to broader themes
- [[Weaponized antitrust]] — now bilateral (West also seizing)
- [[CHIPS Act]] — [[EU]] building domestic capacity partly to avoid this dependence
- [[Export controls]] — US Entity List triggered cascade

---

## Corporate lineage

Philips → [[NXP]] (2006) → Nexperia (2017) → Wingtech (2018) → Dutch government (2025)

Ironic: Philips semiconductor legacy now a geopolitical flashpoint.
