# Super Bowl LX

Super Bowl LX — Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California, February 8, 2026. Broadcast on NBC ([[Comcast|NBCUniversal]]) with simulcast on Peacock, Telemundo, and NFL+. Seattle Seahawks 29, New England Patriots 13.

The game itself was secondary to what LX revealed about advertising spend: AI companies accounted for ~23% of all spots (15 of 66 commercials), Chinese brands continued Temu's beachhead strategy, and GLP-1 telehealth went mainstream with a Super Bowl buy. Ad inventory sold out by September 2025 — the earliest sellout on record.

## AI advertising bloc

~23% of all commercials featured AI — either advertising AI products or using AI in production. This was the first Super Bowl where AI companies formed a distinct advertising bloc, drawing comparisons to the dot-com Super Bowls of 2000.

| Company | Spot | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[OpenAI]] | 60s — "You Can Just Build Things" | Promoted Codex; hands-on maker imagery |
| [[Anthropic]] | Multiple 30s — "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude." | Anti-ad-supported positioning; sparked [[Sam Altman]] social media feud |
| [[Google]] | "New Home" (Gemini) | Best-rated AI ad per multiple panels |
| [[Meta]] | Oakley Meta glasses | "Athletic Intelligence" rebrand of AI; Marshawn Lynch, Spike Lee |
| [[Amazon]] | AI presence | Part of broader tech bloc |
| GenSpark | 2x airings — Matthew Broderick | "Let AI finish your work, take Monday off" |
| [[Wix]] | "The New Way to Create" — Wix Harmony | AI website builder; Candi Staton "You Got the Love"; 7-year SB hiatus return |
| [[Base44]] ([[Wix]]) | "It's App to You" | Vibe coding app builder; [[Wix]] bought double feature; in-house creative, directed by Tal Rosenthal/Noam Sharon |
| Svedka | "Shake Your Bots Off" | First "primarily" AI-generated national SB spot |

Reception was mixed to negative. Ad Age/Harris consumer survey showed mostly negative sentiment toward AI ad saturation. Sports Illustrated reported fans were visibly annoyed before halftime. Commentary drew parallels to sector-specific bubble indicators.

## Notable advertisers by category

### Health & pharma — GLP-1 goes primetime

| Brand | Spot | Investment signal |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| [[Novo Nordisk]] (Wegovy) | 90s — oral pill launch; Kenan Thompson, DJ Khaled, John C. Reilly | Longest pharma spot; oral Wegovy push |
| [[Ro]] | Serena Williams — "Healthier on Ro" (lost 34 lbs on GLP-1) | First major telehealth SB buy; see [[DTC Telehealth]] |
| [[Novartis]] | NFL tight ends — prostate cancer screening (uACR) | Disease awareness play |

Two of the top pharma spots were [[GLP-1 receptor agonists]] related — a first.

### Chinese brands — Temu playbook continues

| Brand | Spot | Strategy |
|-------|------|----------|
| [[Dreame Technology]] | 30s — vacuum-to-EV robot transformation ($10M) | CES-to-Super Bowl pipeline; EV teaser for 2027 launch despite 100% tariff wall |

[[Dreame Technology]] followed [[PDD Holdings]]'s Temu playbook (6 SB ads in 2024, ~$42M). Temu itself was absent from LX — potentially a sign that the beachhead-via-advertising phase has matured for PDD while newer Chinese brands are picking up the strategy.
