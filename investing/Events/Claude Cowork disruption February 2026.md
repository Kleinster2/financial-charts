**Cowork** (Jan 12) was "Claude Code for the rest of your work" — an agentic file manager that could read files, organize folders, and execute multi-step tasks. Markets shrugged.

**Cowork Plugins** (Jan 30) changed everything. The 11 plugins targeted specific professional workflows:

## Why this hit so hard

**1. Credibility:** [[Anthropic]] is a top-3 AI lab. This isn't vaporware.

**2. Scope:** Unlike narrow AI tools, Cowork targets end-to-end workflows — the entire value chain that professional services firms monetize.

**3. Pricing:** Implied per-task pricing undercuts human labor by 90%+ on routine work.

**4. Timing:** Came after years of AI hype without visible disruption to white-collar business models. This felt like the shoe finally dropping.

## Bull case (recovery thesis)

- **Enterprise sales cycles are long** — adoption will take years
- **Regulatory/compliance moats** — some workflows require human sign-off
- **Incumbent data advantages** — Westlaw's case law, PitchBook's PE data
- **P/E compression overshoots** — 30% haircut priced in worst case

---

## Bear case (disruption thesis)

- **This is GPT-3 → GPT-4 moment for agents** — capabilities will compound
- **Pricing power evaporates** — can't charge $500/hr for work AI does for $5
- **New entrants** — startups will undercut incumbents using Cowork APIs
- **Talent flight** — junior analysts/lawyers reconsider career paths
