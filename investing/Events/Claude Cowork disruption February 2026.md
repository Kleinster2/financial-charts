# Claude Cowork disruption February 2026

[[Anthropic]] launched Claude Cowork plugins on Thursday January 30, 2026 — 11 open-source plugins targeting legal, sales, marketing, and financial workflows. The market response was immediate and brutal.

## Timeline

| Feb 3-4    | Market selloff ("SaaSpocalypse")                    |

Cowork (Jan 12) was "Claude Code for the rest of your work" — an agentic file manager that could read files, organize folders, and execute multi-step tasks. Markets shrugged.

Cowork Plugins (Jan 30) changed everything. The 11 plugins targeted specific professional workflows:

| Plug-in | Target workflow | Disruption thesis |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Legal Cowork | Contract review, legal research, due diligence | Threatens [[Thomson Reuters]], [[RELX]], [[LegalZoom]] |
| Sales Cowork | Lead generation, CRM automation, proposals | Threatens CRM/sales software |
| Marketing Cowork | Campaign creation, content, analytics | Threatens [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]], agencies |
| Data Cowork | Analytics, reporting, business intelligence | Threatens [[FactSet]], [[Morningstar]], data vendors |

$285B rout across software, financial services, and asset management stocks over two trading days.

### Hardest hit — Legal/data analytics

| Company | Move | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[LegalZoom]] | -20% | Online legal services most exposed |
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | -18% | Record daily loss, lowest since Jun 2021 |
| [[RELX]] | -14% | Worst day since 1988, nearly halved from peak |

## Why this hit so hard

1. Credibility: [[Anthropic]] is a top-3 AI lab. This isn't vaporware.

2. Scope: Unlike narrow AI tools, Cowork targets end-to-end workflows — the entire value chain that professional services firms monetize.

3. Pricing: Implied per-task pricing undercuts human labor by 90%+ on routine work.

4. Timing: Came after years of AI hype without visible disruption to white-collar business models. This felt like the shoe finally dropping.

## Secondary catalyst: Palantir earnings (Feb 2)

The night before the main selloff, [[Palantir]] held their Q4 2025 earnings call. CTO Shyam Sankar made a statement that rippled through enterprise software:

> "AIFD is now capable of powering complex SAP ERP migrations from ECC to S/4. Years of work now done in as little as two weeks."

Why it mattered:
- SAP migrations are multi-year, multi-million dollar projects — the bread and butter of enterprise IT consulting
- Palantir isn't an AI startup making promises — they're a $100B+ company with government and enterprise customers
- The statement made the Cowork plugins feel less theoretical and more immediate
- [[SAP]] often cited as losing €40B market cap, but that was primarily the Jan 29 earnings miss (-15%), not the SaaSpocalypse (-4.8% on Feb 3)

The Palantir statement came 4 days after the plugins launch but hours before the main selloff — it may have been the catalyst that turned concern into panic.

## Week-ending damage (Bloomberg, Feb 8)

Full-week impact wider than initial 2-day selloff:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total stocks hit | 164 (software, financial services, asset management) |
| Total market cap erased | $611B (full week) |
| IGV (software ETF) | -12% over 4 sessions, then Friday rebound |
| Thomson Reuters | -20% for week (steepest fall ever, Canada-listed) |
| [[Morningstar]] | Worst week since 2009 |
| [[HubSpot]], [[Atlassian]], [[Zscaler]] | Each -16%+ |
| [[Salesforce]] | -48% from Dec 2024 record high |
| [[ServiceNow]] | -57% from Jan 2025 peak |

Positioning collapse:
- Software = most net-sold sector YTD ([[Goldman Sachs]] prime brokerage data)
- Hedge fund net software exposure: record low <3% (from 18% peak in 2023)
- [[Goldman Sachs]] software basket P/E: record low 21x (from 100+ in late 2021)
- [[IGV]] RSI hit 15 on Thursday (lowest in ~15 years; <30 = oversold)

Fundamental disconnect:
- S&P 500 software/services earnings projected +19% for 2026 (up from +16% a few months ago)
- [[Salesforce]] at 14x forward P/E (10-year average: 46x)
- Analysts see no fundamental deterioration yet -- market pricing future disruption

Catalysts cited: [[Anthropic]] Cowork plugins, [[Google DeepMind]] [[Genie 3]] (roiled game stocks), disappointing [[Microsoft]] cloud guidance (-$357B in one day), [[ServiceNow]] and [[SAP]] lackluster earnings.

## Bull case (recovery thesis)

- Enterprise sales cycles are long — adoption will take years
- Regulatory/compliance moats — some workflows require human sign-off
- Incumbent data advantages — Westlaw's case law, PitchBook's PE data
- P/E compression overshoots — 30% haircut priced in worst case

---

## Bear case (disruption thesis)

- This is GPT-3 → GPT-4 moment for agents — capabilities will compound
- Pricing power evaporates — can't charge $500/hr for work AI does for $5
- New entrants — startups will undercut incumbents using Cowork APIs
- Talent flight — junior analysts/lawyers reconsider career paths
