## Trump's pitch

### Investment ask

> "The plan is for them to spend — meaning our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100 billion of their money, not the government's money. They don't need government money, but they need government protection and need government security."

### Security guarantee

> "We're going to make sure there's very, very good security. And I think the people of Venezuela are going to give you very good security."

### On Venezuelan crude

> Venezuelan heavy crude is "the best there is in the world for asphalt roads."

### Geopolitical openness

Venezuela will be "open for business" for all nations including [[Russia]] and [[China]] to purchase oil.

### On military action

Second wave of attacks cancelled — initial operation was "so powerful and so good" that Venezuelan leadership "did the right thing."

---

## Industry response

### Conditional Engagement

[[Oil]] executives made **no firm investment commitments**, citing the current environment as a barrier. Exxon CEO Darren Woods assessed that Venezuela has been **"uninvestable"** due to its legal and commercial frameworks, implying that significant reforms are a prerequisite for any future capital deployment.

### Deep skepticism

[[Oil]] executives expressed deep skepticism about pouring substantial capital into Venezuela, where profitability and government stability remain deeply uncertain.

### Key concerns

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Rule of law** | No stable legal framework for investment |
| **History** | Companies lost billions in prior ventures |
| **[[PDVSA]] militarization** | Venezuelan military runs state oil company |
| **Infrastructure theft** | Rampant theft from energy facilities |
| **Hostage risk** | History of executive detention |
| **No transition government** | Who runs the country unclear |

### Past losses

| Company | History |
|---------|---------|
| [[Exxon]] | Exited 2007 after refusing minority terms; suing for ~$1.6B |
| [[ConocoPhillips]] | Exited 2007; seeking $12B arbitration award |
| [[Chevron]] | Only US company that stayed (accepted minority role) |

| [[ConocoPhillips]] settlement | Debt resolved, path to return |
| [[Chevron]] expansion | Existing operator scaling up |

| Services | [[Halliburton]], [[Schlumberger]], [[Baker Hughes]] | Infrastructure rebuild |

## Aftermath — Trump retaliates against Exxon (Jan 12)

Three days after the meeting, Trump publicly criticized Exxon for Woods' "uninvestable" remarks:

| Date | Trump statement |
|------|-----------------|
| Jan 12, 2026 | "I didn't like Exxon's response" |
| | "I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out" |
| | "They're playing too cute" |

**Context:** Comments made aboard Air Force One returning from Palm Beach.

**On guarantees:** When asked what protections he offered oil companies, Trump said past problems happened "because they didn't have Trump as a president, they had stupid people."

**Implication:** Trump signaling he'll reward companies that publicly support his Venezuela agenda and punish those who push back. [[Chevron]] — the only current operator — may benefit if [[Exxon]] excluded.
