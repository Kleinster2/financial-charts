## Oil company reaction

**Hesitation despite opportunity:**

- Security environment unstable
- Companies want favorable terms to offset risk
- Markets oversupplied, prices low near-term
- Infrastructure severely degraded
- Expertise gap (brain drain since 2007)

**[[Chevron]]:** Only US company currently operating in Venezuela. License status uncertain during transition.

**[[Exxon]]:** Exited in 2007, won arbitration. Could potentially return under new regime.
