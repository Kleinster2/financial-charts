**JGB crash January 2026** — $280 million of trading triggered a $41 billion wipeout across Japan's government bond curve on January 21, 2026. Ultra-long yields surged to record highs. [[Scott Bessent]] called it a "six-standard-deviation move."

## What happened

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | January 21, 2026 |
| Trigger volume | **$280M** combined (30Y + 40Y) |
| Market cap wipeout | **$41B** across JGB curve |
| 30Y yield move | +25+ bps intraday |
| 40Y yield move | +25+ bps intraday |
| 40Y yield (post-rout) | **>4%** — first JGB maturity above 4% in 30+ years |
| 30Y yield (post-rout) | ~3.66% (record high) |

For comparison: $41B traded in 10Y JGB futures the same day. The cash market for ultra-longs is structurally illiquid.

## Market structure problem

**Why $280M moved a $7.2T market:**

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| [[BOJ]] holdings | 50%+ of JGBs — supply absorbed |
| BOJ QT | Cutting purchases ¥400B/month → slowing to ¥200B/quarter from April |
| Life insurer pullback | Traditional long-end buyers stepped back |
| Life insurer losses | Big 4 reported **$60B combined unrealized losses** on domestic bonds, 4x prior year |
| Foreign share | 65% of monthly cash transactions (up from 12% in 2009) |
| Dealer constraints | Balance sheets limited, thin depth |
| Price discovery | Marginal trade sets price, not volume-weighted |

Mizuho's Shoki Omori: "This is not a paradox: it is exactly what you expect in a market where depth is thin, dealer balance sheets are constrained, and prices are set by the marginal trade."

## Dislocation index

Bloomberg's JGB market dislocation index (measures divergence from theoretical values) hit an all-time high — exceeding 2008, 2011, and 2022 spikes.

*Dislocation surged past 8 bps, the highest since the index began.*

## Catalysts

| Catalyst | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Weak 20Y auction** | Tepid response earlier in day — proximate trigger |
| **Inflation adjustment** | Japan normalizing after decades of deflation |
| **BOJ tightening** | Rate at 0.5%, market pricing more |
| **Fiscal concerns** | PM [[Sanae Takaichi]]'s sales tax pause on food — **¥5T/year** (~$31.6B) |
| **Nov stimulus** | ¥21.3T ($137B) package approved Nov 21 — biggest since pandemic |
| **Life insurer retreat** | Traditional buyers stepping back |

**Fiscal backdrop:**
- Takaichi called snap election for **Feb 8, 2026** — promised 2-year food tax suspension
- Main opposition (Centrist Reform Alliance) pledged **permanent** food tax abolition
- Fiscal discipline concerns across entire political spectrum
- Government shifting issuance to short-term debt (boosting 2Y/5Y by ¥300B each) to avoid long-end pressure
- Takaichi: "impossible to isolate the impact of fiscal policy on yield moves"

BOJ Governor Ueda warned Dec 9 that yields were rising "at a somewhat rapid pace."

**Rumored sellers:** Primary dealers, hedge funds, life insurers. No confirmed culprit.

## Corporate bond spillover

Japan's credit market also hit — average yields on high-grade corporate bonds jumped to a record. At least one multi-million dollar deal was pulled when the prospective buyer got spooked by broader financing cost concerns.

---

## Contagion risk

**Citi estimate:** JGB turmoil risks up to **$130B Treasury selling** as Japanese institutions repatriate.

**Mechanism:**
1. JGB yields spike → domestic bonds more attractive
2. Japanese life insurers/pensions sell foreign bonds
3. Repatriation = sell Treasuries, buy yen
4. UST yields rise, JPY strengthens
5. Carry trade unwind accelerates

## Market response

| Actor | Response |
|-------|----------|
| [[Scott Bessent]] | Sought reassurances from [[BOJ]]; called it "6-sigma move" |
| [[Satsuki Katayama]] | Finance Minister called for market calm |
| [[BOJ]] | Policy decision Friday Jan 24 watched closely |
| [[SMFG]] | Japan's \#2 bank announced big JGB purchases after rout |
| Traders | Called it most chaotic session in recent memory |
| Reed Capital | Bought JGBs during panic — "markets were so dislocated" |
| T. Rowe Price | Covered underweight position during selloff |

**Trader quotes:**
- "This is basically the market pricing in a Liz Truss moment in Japan." — Masahiko Loo, State Street
- "A routine pass of the 20-year bond auction quickly turned into a meltdown." — Shinji Kunibe, SMFG Asset Management

---

## Resolution

By Thursday Jan 23, calm returned:
- 30Y yield fell ~5 bps to 3.66%
- Still elevated vs Monday close
- 40Y auction next week = key test

---

## Why it matters

1. **Global precedent** — If Japan's market can break on $280M, other thin markets vulnerable
2. **BOJ credibility** — Can [[BOJ]] normalize without market accidents?
3. **Carry trade** — JPY funding remains systemic risk (see [[Carry trade]])
4. **Fiscal warning** — "Liz Truss moment" comparisons legitimate
5. **Treasury linkage** — Japanese selling could pressure UST

## Yield curve steepening

![[jgb-yield-curve-steepest.png]]
*Japan's 10Y-30Y spread (~140-160 bps) far exceeds US, UK, Germany (~60-80 bps). Steepest among major markets.*

## Comparison: UK gilt crisis (Sep 2022)

| Metric | UK Gilts (2022) | JGBs (2026) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Trigger | Mini-budget fiscal shock | Inflation + fiscal concerns |
| Central bank response | BOE emergency buying | [[BOJ]] watching |
| Market structure | LDI leverage | Ultra-thin liquidity |
| Resolution | BOE intervention | Unclear |
