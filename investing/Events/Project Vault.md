## Announcement

Announced by President Trump at Oval Office event, Feb 2, 2026:

> "For years, American businesses have risked running out of critical minerals during market disruptions. Today, we're launching what will be known as Project Vault to ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage."

**Key attendees:**
- [[GM]] CEO Mary Barra (representing end users)
- Robert Friedland, mining billionaire (representing producers)

## Structure

| Component | Amount | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| [[EXIM Bank]] loan | $10B | Approved same day |
| Private capital | ~$1.7-2B | Institutional investors (TBD) |
| **Total** | **~$12B** | |

**Procurement managers:** [[Hartree Partners]], [[Traxys North America]], [[Mercuria Energy Group]] — commodities trading firms will source raw materials.

**Governance:** Executive structure to be established; EXIM likely to have board seat.

## Goals

1. **60-day emergency supply** of minerals for US manufacturers
2. **Price stabilization** — offset [[China]] manipulation of lithium, nickel, rare earths
3. **Balance sheet relief** — companies access materials without carrying inventory risk
4. **Domestic mining support** — create stable demand for US producers

Administration official compared logistics to "Costco membership" — buying in volume for members.

## Minerals included

Per WSJ: rare earths, gallium, cobalt, and other [[critical minerals]].

Core targets are inputs for:
- Electric vehicles
- High-tech weaponry

- **Jan 2026:** [[China]] imposed dual-use equipment export ban on [[Japan]]
