# Project Vault

**Project Vault** — first-of-its-kind government-backed critical minerals stockpile announced Feb 2, 2026 to secure [[United States|U.S.]] supply and counter [[China]] price leverage.

---

## What happened

- Feb 2, 2026: President [[Donald Trump]] announced Project Vault in the Oval Office, positioning it as a 60-day emergency minerals reserve for U.S. manufacturers.
- Financing structure targets ~$12B: $10B [[EXIM Bank]] loan plus ~$1.7-2B private capital.
- Procurement will be handled by commodity traders [[Hartree Partners]], [[Traxys North America]], and [[Mercuria Energy Group]].
- Initial scope includes [[Rare earth elements]], [[Copper]], [[Lithium]], [[Gallium]], [[Cobalt]], and other [[Critical minerals]] used in [[Electric vehicles]], [[Defense]] systems, and [[Advanced manufacturing]].
- Administration compared access mechanics to a [[Costco]]-style membership for participating companies.

## Structure

| Component | Amount | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| [[EXIM Bank]] loan | $10B | Approved same day |
| Private capital | $2B | Institutional investors |
| **Total** | **~$12B** | |

**Procurement managers:** [[Hartree Partners]], [[Traxys North America]], [[Mercuria Energy Group]]

**Governance:** Led by independent CEO; [[EXIM Bank]] has board seat.

**Membership model:** Companies pay annual fee for right to withdraw minerals during supply emergencies. Vault takes small operational fee; procurement traders also take small cut. Vault itself not designed to profit.

---

## Goals

1. **60-day emergency supply** of minerals for [[United States|U.S.]] manufacturers
2. **Price stabilization** — offset [[China]] manipulation of [[Lithium]], [[Nickel]], and [[Rare earth elements]]
3. **Balance sheet relief** — companies access materials without carrying inventory risk
4. **Domestic mining support** — create stable demand for [[United States|U.S.]] producers

## Market reaction

After-hours moves on announcement:

| Company | Move | Exposure |
|---------|------|----------|
| [[MP Materials]] (MP) | +2% | Mountain Pass mine, CA |
| [[USA Rare Earth]] (USAR) | +2% | Domestic mining + magnets |
| [[Critical Metals Corp]] (CRML) | +1% | |
| [[First Phosphate]] (FRSPF) | +12% | Canadian phosphate |

[[USA Rare Earth]] already in talks with Commerce Secretary [[Howard Lutnick]] for ~$1.6B funding deal with government equity stake.

## The real story

Builds on prior government involvement:

- **Jul 2025:** [[U.S. Department of Defense]] took equity stake in [[MP Materials]], established price floor + long-term purchase agreement
- **Jan 2026:** Bipartisan bill introduced for $2.5B stockpile (separate from Project Vault)
- **Jan 2026:** [[China]] imposed dual-use equipment export ban on [[Japan]]

## Analyst reaction

Tim Puko ([[Eurasia Group]]): Not an immediate game-changer for reducing China dependence, but important initiative that could stabilize market longer-term. Key test is follow-through and proving credibility to partners.

---

## Insights

- The stockpile shifts inventory risk from private firms to a government-backed balance sheet while preserving private procurement execution.
- Financing mixes sovereign-style credit ([[EXIM Bank]]) with private capital, signaling durability beyond a single budget cycle.
- The program targets [[China]]'s leverage over strategic minerals more than near-term price moves.
