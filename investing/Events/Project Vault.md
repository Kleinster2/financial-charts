**Project Vault** — $12B strategic minerals stockpile program announced Feb 2026. Combines private funding with $10B [[EXIM Bank]] loan to acquire and stockpile [[critical minerals]] for US manufacturers.

## Structure

| Component | Amount | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Private funding | ~$2B | TBD |
| EXIM Bank loan | $10B | Export-Import Bank |
| **Total** | **$12B** | |

**Purpose:** Stockpile minerals for automakers, technology companies, and other manufacturers to reduce [[China]] dependency.

---

## Context

Announced amid escalating [[US-China relations]] tensions over [[critical minerals]]. [[China]] controls:
- 90%+ of rare earth processing
- 99% of [[gallium]] refining
- 60% of [[germanium]] refining

Jan 2026 saw [[China]] impose dual-use equipment export bans on [[Japan]] following PM Takaichi's [[Taiwan]] comments. Project Vault is part of broader US response to mineral supply chain vulnerabilities.

## Strategic significance

**First major government-backed stockpile since Cold War.** Previous US strategic reserves focused on oil (SPR); minerals were neglected as [[China]] built dominance.

**EXIM Bank involvement** signals:
- Willingness to use government credit for supply chain security
- Potential model for other critical industries
- Bypasses congressional appropriations (loan vs. spending)

## Potential beneficiaries

| Company | Exposure | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| [[MP Materials]] | Direct | US rare earth miner/processor |
| Perpetua Resources | Direct | US antimony (Idaho) |
| Lynas | Indirect | Non-[[China]] rare earths ([[Australia]]) |
| [[Albemarle]] | Possible | Lithium if included |
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | Possible | Copper if included |

**$PHOS (Phosphorus miners)** rallied 14% on announcement — suggests market expects phosphate/fertilizer minerals included.

## Open questions

1. **Which minerals?** Announcement mentions "minerals" broadly — rare earths, antimony, lithium, graphite all candidates
2. **Private partners?** $2B private component not yet disclosed
3. **Storage/management?** Who operates the stockpile?
4. **Draw-down triggers?** Under what conditions would stockpile be released?
