# Citrini "2028 Global Intelligence Crisis"

On February 22, 2026, **Citrini Research** (founded 2023 by James van Geelen, co-authored with Alap Shah of Lotus Technology Management) published "The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis" — a scenario exercise written as a fictional macro memo from June 2028. It went viral and moved markets on Monday Feb 23.

## The Scenario

Written from the perspective of June 2028, looking back at a 38% S&P drawdown from October 2026 highs, with unemployment at 10.2%. The core thesis: **what if AI bullishness is right, and that's actually bearish?**

### Phase 1: The SaaS Compression (Mid-2026)

- Agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Codex) enable competent devs to replicate mid-market SaaS in weeks
- CIOs start asking "what if we just built this ourselves?"
- **ServiceNow Q3 2026:** net new ACV growth decelerates to 14% from 23%; 15% workforce reduction; stock -18%
- Key reflexivity: ServiceNow sells seats → clients cut 15% of headcount → cancel 15% of licenses → the AI-driven layoffs at customers mechanically destroy ServiceNow's revenue
- Incumbents don't resist (unlike Kodak/Blockbuster) — they can't afford to. They adopt AI aggressively, accelerating the displacement loop

### Phase 2: The Intermediation Collapse (Late 2026-2027)

AI agents destroy business models built on **human friction**:
- Travel platforms → agents assemble complete itineraries cheaper
- Insurance renewals → agents re-shop annually, eliminating 15-20% passive renewal premiums
- Real estate → buy-side commissions compress from 2.5-3% to under 1% ("agent on agent violence")
- Financial advice, tax prep, routine legal work → all disrupted
- **DoorDash** → vibe-coded competitors launched in weeks, agents check 20+ platforms for lowest fee

Key concept: **"Habitual intermediation"** — moats based on app loyalty, checkout UX, brand familiarity. Machines don't have a home screen.

### Phase 3: Payments Disruption (Early 2027)

- Agents optimizing transactions route around 2-3% card interchange via stablecoins (Solana, Ethereum L2s)
- **Mastercard Q1 2027:** purchase volume growth slows to +3.4% from +5.9%; stock -9%
- AmEx hit hardest: white-collar customer base shrinking + interchange routing
- *"Their moats were made of friction. And friction was going to zero."*

### Phase 4: The Macro Transmission (2027)

The "Human Intelligence Displacement Spiral" — a feedback loop with no natural brake:

> AI capabilities improve → companies need fewer workers → layoffs increase → displaced workers spend less → margin pressure → invest more in AI → AI capabilities improve

Key dynamics:
- White-collar workers = 50% of employment but drive ~75% of discretionary consumer spending
- Top 10% of earners = 50%+ of all consumer spending
- Displaced workers downshift to gig economy, compressing wages there too
- **"Ghost GDP"**: output that shows up in national accounts but never circulates through the real economy
- AI investment grew even as total company spending shrank (OpEx substitution, not new CapEx)
- **No natural floor** — unlike cyclical recessions, the cause (AI getting better) doesn't self-correct

### Phase 5: Private Credit Blowup (Q3-Q4 2027)

- Private credit had grown to $2.5T by 2026, heavily deployed in PE-backed SaaS deals
- PE marks lagged reality: public comps at 5-8x EBITDA while private marks still reflected acquisition valuations
- Moody's downgrades $18B of PE-backed software debt across 14 issuers
- **Zendesk** (taken private by Hellman & Friedman + Permira for $10.2B in 2022) misses debt covenants; $5B facility marked to 58 cents

### Phase 6: Global Contagion

- **India:** IT services ($200B+ annual exports) gutted as AI coding costs collapse to cost of electricity. TCS, Infosys, Wipro see contract cancellations. Rupee falls 18% in 4 months. IMF "preliminary discussions" by Q1 2028
- **Winners:** Taiwan, Korea (convex to AI infra buildout); NVDA still posting records; TSM at 95%+ utilization

## Market Impact (Feb 23, 2026)

IBM suffered its **worst trading day in 25 years**. Major software and payments stocks fell:
- ServiceNow, Monday.com, Zapier-adjacent names sold off
- Visa, Mastercard dropped (MA more than V)
- DoorDash fell despite questionable thesis applicability
- Indian IT (TCS, Infosys, Wipro) among top Sensex losers

## Reactions & Rebuttals

### Bullish on the scenario
- **Michael Burry** amplified: "And you think I'm bearish"
- **Brendan Duke** (ex-Biden NEC): "A lot of people have a hard time with the concept of a thought experiment" — flagged prime white-collar mortgage defaults as underappreciated risk

### Skeptical / Bearish on the scenario

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Noah Smith** (Noahpinion) | "Just a scary bedtime story." Scenario lacks formal macro model. The micro thesis (which jobs get disrupted) may have merit, but the macro thesis (this causes a depression) doesn't follow automatically. Neither plausible crash mechanism (demand shock or financial crisis) is very likely |
| **Claudia Sahm** | Focus on destructive (left) rather than constructive (right) tail. A labor shock of this magnitude would trigger forceful fiscal/monetary response, which the report downplays |
| **Joseph Steinberg** (U of T) | "Purestrain slop." Ignores how economies actually function — output, income, and spending are interconnected |
| **Michael Bloch** (Quiet Capital) | Published rebuttal "The 2028 Global Intelligence Boom." Cheaper services = households and startups have more to spend |
| **Jeff Dorman** (Arca CIO) | "The biggest takeaway is that fear sells." Markets reward dramatic crash predictions even when they rarely materialize |
| **Deepak Shenoy** (Capitalmind) | Compared to 2008 peak oil fears that didn't materialize. "Doomsday porn is addictive" |
| **Alex Imas** (Chicago Booth) | "Conditions needed for negative GDP growth seem too extreme. Assumes almost total automation, no policy response, and that institutions do not change" |
| **Matt Yglesias** | Would like to see economists formally model it; thinks treatment of fiscal policy is wrong |

## Assessment

**Strengths:**
- The reflexivity loop (clients cut headcount → per-seat SaaS revenue mechanically declines) is genuinely underappreciated
- "Habitual intermediation" as a moat category is a useful framework
- The PE/private credit exposure to SaaS deals at peak multiples is a real risk
- India IT services vulnerability is well-articulated and already partially visible
- Written engagingly — the scenario format makes abstract macro risks visceral

**Weaknesses:**
- No formal economic model — assumes the worst at every junction
- Ignores fiscal/monetary policy response entirely
- Assumes AI displaces faster than new roles emerge (the "this time is different" bet)
- Conflates sector rotation with systemic crisis
- DoorDash example undermined by the fact its moat was never technical (it's network effects + scale)
- The 2-year timeline from "contained" to 10% unemployment is extremely aggressive

**Key question:** Is the white-collar displacement spiral a **cyclical adjustment** (painful but self-correcting, like every prior tech disruption) or a **structural break** (genuinely "this time is different" because AI improves at the very tasks humans redeploy to)?
