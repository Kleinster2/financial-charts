# Citrini "2028 Global Intelligence Crisis"

On February 22, 2026, **Citrini Research** published "The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis" — a scenario exercise written as a fictional macro memo from June 2028. Co-authored with **Alap Shah** of Lotus Technology Management (who wrote a companion Part One). It went viral over the weekend (~20K likes, 16M+ impressions on X) and triggered a major market selloff on Monday Feb 23.

---

## Who Are the Authors?

**Citrini Research** — founded 2023 by James van Geelen. Top finance writer on Substack. The firm describes itself as focused on technology and macro research.

**Alap Shah** — founder of Lotus Technology Management (LOTUS Fund), previously a consumer analyst at Viking Global and Citadel. Co-founded Sentieo (AI financial search engine, sold for $200M+ in 2022). Also runs littlebird.ai (personal AI) and a startup incubator. Shah's Part One draws on 20 years of public market investing and 15 years building AI companies.

Shah's credibility matters: he's not a commentator — he's actively running companies that have replaced roles with AI agents. He writes from direct experience that agentic coding has collapsed prototyping from weeks to minutes, and that AI financial research agents produce "near comparable quality" to human analysts at <1% of the cost.

---

## Part One: The Rise of Agentic AI (Shah)

Shah's companion piece provides the empirical foundation for the scenario:

### The capability curve
- Per METR benchmarks, the duration of tasks AI models can complete unaided is **doubling every 6-7 months**, with recent acceleration
- Current leading models can execute **14.5 hours** of continuous autonomous work
- Trendline points to a **full month** of unaided work by mid-2028

### Real-world adoption at Shah's companies
- Prototyping a feature went from 2 weeks (PM + designer + engineers) to **minutes** with agentic coding
- Financial research that took an analyst days now takes AI agents **minutes** at comparable quality
- Token cost: **<1% of human cost** for equivalent work
- Agents share "nearly perfect, continuous context" — eliminating the coordination tax (Ronald Coase's Theory of the Firm applied to AI)
- Roles now performed wholesale by agents: data analytics, data migration, certain design, devops, customer service roles. List growing monthly.

### The white-collar labor market is already fragile
- Core white-collar employment (ex-government, healthcare, education) has been **stagnant/declining since 2023**
- Information sector employment already **8% below peak**, below even pre-pandemic 2020 levels
- Only +4% from pre-pandemic over 6 years vs. population growth of 5% and real GDP growth of 11%
- Companies already doing more with fewer humans *before* agentic AI enters the picture

### CEO warnings
- **Dario Amodei** (Anthropic, May 2025): AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, spike unemployment to 10-20% in 1-5 years
- **Mustafa Suleyman** (Microsoft AI, Feb 2026): "Most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months"
- Shah estimates even **5% white-collar job losses** in 12-24 months would upset the fragile supply-demand balance

---

## Part Two: The Scenario (Citrini + Shah)

Written from the perspective of June 2028, looking back at a 38% S&P drawdown from October 2026 highs, with unemployment at 10.2%. The core thesis: **what if AI bullishness is right, and that's actually bearish?**

### Phase 1: The SaaS Compression (Mid-2026)

- Agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Codex) enable competent devs to replicate mid-market SaaS in weeks
- CIOs start asking "what if we just built this ourselves?"
- **ServiceNow Q3 2026:** net new ACV growth decelerates to 14% from 23%; 15% workforce reduction; stock -18%
- Key reflexivity: ServiceNow sells seats → clients cut 15% of headcount → cancel 15% of licenses → the AI-driven layoffs at customers mechanically destroy ServiceNow's revenue
- *"The company that sold workflow automation was being disrupted by better workflow automation, and its response was to cut headcount and use the savings to fund the very technology disrupting it. What else were they supposed to do? Sit still and die slower?"*
- Incumbents don't resist (unlike Kodak/Blockbuster) — they can't afford to. They adopt AI aggressively, accelerating the displacement loop

### Phase 2: The Intermediation Collapse (Late 2026-2027)

AI agents destroy business models built on **human friction**:
- Travel platforms → agents assemble complete itineraries cheaper
- Insurance renewals → agents re-shop annually, eliminating 15-20% passive renewal premiums
- Real estate → buy-side commissions compress from 2.5-3% to under 1% ("agent on agent violence")
- Financial advice, tax prep, routine legal work → all disrupted
- **DoorDash** → vibe-coded competitors launched in weeks, agents check 20+ platforms for lowest fee

Key concept: **"Habitual intermediation"** — moats based on app loyalty, checkout UX, brand familiarity. Machines don't have a home screen.

### Phase 3: Payments Disruption (Early 2027)

- Agents optimizing transactions route around 2-3% card interchange via stablecoins (Solana, Ethereum L2s)
- **Mastercard Q1 2027:** purchase volume growth slows to +3.4% from +5.9%; stock -9%
- AmEx hit hardest: white-collar customer base shrinking + interchange routing
- *"Their moats were made of friction. And friction was going to zero."*

### Phase 4: The Macro Transmission (2027)

The "Human Intelligence Displacement Spiral" — a feedback loop with no natural brake:

> AI capabilities improve → companies need fewer workers → layoffs increase → displaced workers spend less → margin pressure → invest more in AI → AI capabilities improve

Key dynamics:
- White-collar workers = 50% of employment but drive ~75% of discretionary consumer spending
- Top 20% of earners drive ~65% of all US consumer spending (Shah)
- Displaced workers downshift to gig economy, compressing wages there too
- **"Ghost GDP"**: output that shows up in national accounts but never circulates through the real economy. *"Machines spend zero dollars on discretionary goods."*
- AI investment grew even as total company spending shrank (OpEx substitution, not new CapEx)
- **No natural floor** — unlike cyclical recessions, the cause (AI getting better) doesn't self-correct

### Phase 5: Private Credit Blowup (Q3-Q4 2027)

- Private credit had grown to $2.5T by 2026, heavily deployed in PE-backed SaaS deals
- PE marks lagged reality: public comps at 5-8x EBITDA while private marks still reflected acquisition valuations
- Moody's downgrades $18B of PE-backed software debt across 14 issuers
- **Zendesk** (taken private by Hellman & Friedman + Permira for $10.2B in 2022) misses debt covenants; $5B facility marked to 58 cents
- Prime white-collar mortgage defaults begin appearing as 6-month savings buffers exhaust

### Phase 6: Global Contagion

- **India:** IT services ($200B+ annual exports) gutted as AI coding costs collapse to cost of electricity. TCS, Infosys, Wipro see contract cancellations. Rupee falls 18% in 4 months. IMF "preliminary discussions" by Q1 2028
- **Winners:** Taiwan, Korea (convex to AI infra buildout); NVDA still posting records; TSM at 95%+ utilization

The authors note wryly that despite the total collapse of white-collar work: *"we are, somehow, still in business."*

## Market Impact (Monday Feb 23, 2026)

**Dow fell 822 points (-1.7%). S&P 500 -1%. Nasdaq -1.1%.** Dow Jones Transportation Average -2.8%. The IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF) hit a **52-week low, down 5% on the day, nearly -30% YTD** — erasing all gains since ChatGPT's launch in Nov 2022.

**Flight to safety:** 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.026% (lowest since late November). Gold +2.9% to $5,204.70/oz. Silver +5.2% to $86.52/oz.

VIX jumped 14%, crossing above 20.

### Specific stock moves (Feb 23)

| Stock | Company | Feb 23 | YTD |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|
| IBM | IBM | **-13.0%** | — |
| CRWD | CrowdStrike | **-10.1%** | -26.4% |
| ZS | Zscaler | **-9.9%** | -36.7% |
| DDOG | Datadog | **-9%+** | — |
| INTU | Intuit | **-8.0%** | -47.0% |
| AXP | American Express | **-7.7%** | — |
| DOCU | DocuSign | **-7.4%** | -40.1% |
| DASH | DoorDash | **-6.6%** | — |
| MA | Mastercard | **-6.3%** | — |
| CRM | Salesforce | **-5.3%** | -34.0% |
| APO | Apollo Global | **-5.0%** | — |
| ADBE | Adobe | **-4.8%** | -29.7% |
| NOW | ServiceNow | **-4.6%** | -35.1% |
| V | Visa | **-4.5%** | — |
| OWL | Blue Owl Capital | **-3.4%** | — |

**Private credit contagion:** Blue Owl -3.4%, Apollo -5%. Lenders from Wall Street banks to regionals sold off. UBS told clients: *"From a credit standpoint, the key risk is speed of disruption rather than its existence. A rapid shock within 12 months could overwhelm contractual protections, but we view a multi-year adjustment as far more likely."*

**Rotation:** Investors moved into energy and consumer staples, but these carry little index weight. Jordan Rizzuto (GammaRoad Capital): *"Be careful what kind of rotation you wish for."*

*Source: WSJ, Fintool, Invezz, market data Feb 23 2026*

**Note:** The selloff was amplified by concurrent factors:
- Anthropic unveiled a new Claude security tool (Friday) → **CrowdStrike -8% Fri, -10% Mon** (25%+ YTD decline)
- Trump announced 15% global tariffs after Supreme Court struck down broader "reciprocal" tariffs
- Broader AI anxiety about OpenAI and Anthropic capabilities crushing enterprise software

**DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang** responded on social media: *"The ground is shifting underneath our feet, and the industry is going to need to adapt to it."* Said agentic commerce would require the firm to evolve to work for both AI agents and real-world merchants.

Jim Cramer on CNBC: *"I can't help but grow more pessimistic when I see how easily a piece of science fiction can crush the market as if it's science fact."* Called it a "dystopian tale" and "a reach."

**ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott** (Q4 2025 earnings call, 3 weeks prior): *"The speculation of AI will eat software companies is out there. Let's clear it up with the facts."* Argued enterprise AI "depends on" workflow orchestration rather than replacing it. Guided to 20% subscription revenue growth for 2026, announced $5B buyback. Stock still -35% YTD.

## Reactions & Rebuttals

### Bullish on the scenario
- **Michael Burry** amplified: "And you think I'm bearish"
- **Brendan Duke** (ex-Biden NEC): "A lot of people have a hard time with the concept of a thought experiment" — flagged prime white-collar mortgage defaults as underappreciated risk

### Major Rebuttals

#### John Loeber — "Contra Citrini7" ([X thread](https://x.com/johnloeber/status/2025748423157432756))

Key arguments:
1. **Institutional inertia** vastly underrated. The "iron rule": *"Everything is always more complicated and takes much longer than you think it will, even if you already know about the iron rule."* Citrini handwaves this away by assuming agents eliminate human friction
2. **Software selloff isn't about vibe coding** — it's because "an uncompetitive, sticky lock-in sector filled with dogshit incumbents is becoming competitive again." There will still be massive demand for the "last mile" of product delivery
3. **Jevons paradox** — when efficiency improves, total consumption tends to *increase*, not decrease. Citrini assumes inelastic demand for human labor
4. **Re-industrialization absorption** — displaced white-collar workers get absorbed by politically bipartisan physical infrastructure buildout (batteries, semis, desalination, bridges). These are inherently human-labor-intensive

#### Michael Bloch (Quiet Capital) — ["The 2028 Global Intelligence Boom"](https://michaelxbloch.substack.com/p/the-2028-global-intelligence-boom)

A full mirror-format rebuttal: same structure, same rigor, opposite conclusion. Written as a fictional memo from June 2028 with S&P at 12,000, Nasdaq above 40,000, unemployment at 3.1%, and real median household purchasing power up 18% since 2025.

Key arguments:
1. **Consumer surplus, not destruction.** Average household spends $8K-12K/year on services whose value prop is navigating complexity (tax prep, insurance, travel, real estate). Agents compress these costs 40-70% = **$4K-7K annual tax-free raise** per household
2. **The dollars don't vanish.** Fortune 500 procurement manager negotiates 30% SaaS discount → division hires 3 people for a new market. "They tracked the dollars leaving software budgets but didn't follow where those dollars went"
3. **Volume offsets rate compression.** Mastercard's per-transaction interchange fell but total volume accelerated. "When every purchase is optimized, people don't stop buying things. They buy more things, just at better prices." Stock recovered and hit new highs by Q2 2028
4. **New business formation explodes.** Cost of launching a business falls 70-80%. Census Bureau: 7.2M new business applications in 2027 (vs. prior record 5.5M in 2021). Displaced professionals build niche tools their former employers would never serve
5. **Acknowledges the pain was real.** Unemployment touched 5.8% in Feb 2027. "Q4 2026 and Q1 2027 were frightening." But displaced workers redeployed faster than bears expected

#### Noah Smith (Noahpinion) — ["Just a scary bedtime story"](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-citrini-post-is-just-a-scary)

- Scenario lacks formal macro model — assumes the worst at every junction
- The micro thesis (which jobs get disrupted) may have merit, but the macro thesis (this causes a depression) doesn't follow automatically
- Neither plausible crash mechanism (demand shock or financial crisis) is very likely
- Would like to see economists formally model it

### Other critics

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Claudia Sahm** | Focus on destructive tail. A labor shock of this magnitude would trigger forceful fiscal/monetary response, which the report downplays |
| **Alex Imas** (Chicago Booth) | "Conditions needed for negative GDP growth seem too extreme. Assumes almost total automation, no policy response, and that institutions do not change" |
| **Joseph Steinberg** (U of T) | "Purestrain slop." Ignores how economies actually function |
| **Jeff Dorman** (Arca CIO) | "The biggest takeaway is that fear sells." Markets reward dramatic crash predictions even when they rarely materialize |
| **Deepak Shenoy** (Capitalmind) | Compared to 2008 peak oil fears. "Doomsday porn is addictive" |
| **Matt Yglesias** | Would like to see formal modeling; thinks treatment of fiscal policy is wrong |
| **Tanmai Gopal** (PromptQL) | Estimated 70% of tasks cannot be automated because AI needs human context that's "too fluid" to keep updated |
| **Deutsche Bank Research** | Prompted an AI to forecast: 92M jobs eliminated by 2030 but **170M new roles created** |

### "Are We Cooked?" analysis

The Substack "Are We Cooked?" offered a useful meta-framework: accepting or rejecting the Citrini hypothesis requires making multiple counter-assumptions about system dynamics — speed, simplicity, openness to external inputs, and observer effects. It's closer to a physics problem than an economic forecast.

## Assessment

### Where the bears are right (Citrini/Shah)
- The **reflexivity loop** (clients cut headcount → per-seat SaaS revenue mechanically declines) is genuinely underappreciated and mechanistically sound
- **"Habitual intermediation"** as a moat category is a useful framework — many businesses' real moats are just friction
- The **PE/private credit exposure** to SaaS deals at peak multiples ($2.5T, Zendesk at $10.2B) is a real landmine
- **India IT services vulnerability** is well-articulated and already partially visible in hiring data
- Shah's **firsthand experience** running AI-first companies lends credibility the scenario lacks from Citrini alone
- **White-collar labor data is already weak** (stagnant since 2023, Information sector below pre-pandemic levels)
- The **METR capability curve** is real and shows no signs of flattening

### Where the bulls are right (Bloch/Loeber/Smith)
- No formal economic model — assumes the worst at every junction without modeling the feedback of cheaper goods/services back into consumer spending
- **Ignores fiscal/monetary policy response entirely** — the government is not a passive observer
- **Jevons paradox** has consistently held across prior tech disruptions
- The **cost of starting a business** collapsing could trigger new business formation that absorbs displaced workers
- Conflates **sector rotation** with systemic crisis — SaaS repricing ≠ economic collapse
- The **2-year timeline** from "contained" to 10% unemployment is extremely aggressive given institutional inertia
- **Consumer surplus** from friction elimination is real and large ($4K-7K/household/year)

### The key unresolved question

Is the white-collar displacement spiral a **cyclical adjustment** (painful but self-correcting, as cheaper services → more spending → new jobs, like every prior tech disruption) or a **structural break** (genuinely "this time is different" because AI improves at the very tasks humans redeploy to, closing off the historical escape valve)?

Neither side has a model. Both are telling stories. The market, for now, is pricing in something closer to Citrini's world: enterprise software -30% YTD, IGV back to pre-ChatGPT levels.

### What to watch
- **Salesforce earnings** (this week) — bellwether for SaaS. AI pricing commentary is the key
- **February jobs report** — any acceleration in white-collar unemployment validates the thesis
- **Private credit marks** — watch for PE-backed software LBO stress
- **New business formation data** — the Bloch thesis depends on this accelerating
- **India IT earnings** — TCS, Infosys guidance for FY27
