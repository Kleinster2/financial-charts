# Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026

[[Insurify]] launched the first insurance app in [[OpenAI]]'s ChatGPT app directory on February 9, 2026 — an AI-powered comparison tool drawing on 196M+ auto insurance quotes and 70,000+ reviews. Insurance broker stocks sold off immediately. The event echoed the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] one week earlier, extending the AI disintermediation thesis from software to financial services distribution.

## Market impact: Feb 9, 2026

### Insurance brokers YTD — synchronized selloff

![[wtw-vs-ajg-vs-aon-vs-mmc-vs-bro-vs-ryan-price-chart.png]]

*All six major brokers fell in lockstep on Feb 9. AJG (-17% YTD) and RYAN (-15% YTD) worst performers. The SaaSpocalypse week (Feb 3-8) had already softened the group before the Insurify catalyst hit.*

### Broker vs. carrier divergence

![[wtw-vs-pgr-vs-cb-vs-trv-price-chart.png]]

*The key divergence: WTW (broker, blue) plunged to -14% YTD while CB and TRV (carriers) held near flat. The market distinguished between the distribution layer (brokers) and the production layer (carriers).*

### Insurance brokers (the middlemen)

| Company | Ticker | Move | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| [[Willis Towers Watson]] | WTW | -12% | Worst session since November 2008 |
| [[Arthur J. Gallagher]] | AJG | -9.9% | Middle-market broker |
| [[Aon]] | AON | -9.3% | #2 global broker |
| [[Marsh McLennan]] | MMC | -6.1% | #1 global broker, more diversified |
| [[Brown & Brown]] | BRO | -7.8% | Specialty/wholesale |
| [[Ryan Specialty]] | RYAN | -8.5% | Specialty/E&S |

S&P 500 Insurance index: -3.9% (biggest drop since October).

### Insurance carriers (less exposed)

| Company | Ticker | Move | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| [[Progressive]] | PGR | -1.2% | Direct-to-consumer model partly insulated |
| [[Chubb]] | CB | -2.1% | Commercial lines, less comparison-shopped |
| [[Travelers]] | TRV | -1.8% | Commercial focus |
| [[AIG]] | AIG | -2.5% | |

*Carriers took smaller hits — they manufacture the product, brokers distribute it. The threat is to the distribution layer.*

## Why this hit hard

1. Timing — came one day after the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] week ended. Investors already primed for AI disintermediation narratives.

2. Distribution, not just capability — unlike Cowork (which showed AI could do professional work), Insurify showed AI reaching consumers at scale inside ChatGPT with 300M+ users.

3. Broker economics are vulnerable — brokers earn commissions on information asymmetry and comparison complexity. An AI that instantly compares 196M quotes across dozens of insurers collapses that value proposition.

4. Pipeline visibility — WaniWani announced a dozen additional insurance AI apps in the OpenAI approval pipeline. [[Anthropic]]'s Claude and [[Google]]'s Gemini expected to follow with their own app standards. This isn't one product — it's a platform shift.

## Parallel to the SaaSpocalypse

| Dimension | [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026\|SaaSpocalypse]] (Feb 3-8) | Insurify selloff (Feb 9) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Trigger | 11 Cowork plugins targeting professional workflows | ChatGPT insurance comparison app |
| Scale | $611B erased, 164 stocks | S&P Insurance index -3.9%, ~$30B broker market cap lost |
| Threat model | AI replaces workflows → per-seat SaaS pricing collapses | AI replaces comparison/advisory → commission model under pressure |
| Worst hit | Middlemen (TRI -20%, RELX -14%, LZ -20%) | Middlemen (WTW -12%, AJG -9.9%, AON -9.3%) |
| Less exposed | Infrastructure/platform plays | Insurance carriers (underwriters) |
| Common pattern | [[AI disintermediation]] of the middleman | [[AI disintermediation]] of the middleman |

The structural vulnerability is identical: businesses that sit between buyer and product, charging fees for information asymmetry, comparison, or advisory work.

## Bull case (broker defense)

- Personal lines ≠ commercial lines — Insurify targets auto insurance comparison. Commercial/specialty insurance (Marsh, Aon's core) requires human advisory for complex, bespoke risk.
- Consulting value — brokers do more than compare prices. They structure programs, negotiate terms, manage claims. AI can't replicate relationship-based placement.
- Retention moats — 90%+ client retention rates. Enterprise clients don't switch brokers because a ChatGPT app exists.
- Regulatory barriers — licensed broker requirements, fiduciary duties, compliance frameworks.
- Bloomberg Intelligence: tools are "force multiplier rather than an existential threat."

## Bear case (disruption thesis)

- Personal lines is the wedge — auto/home comparison is commoditized first, then AI expands into small commercial, then mid-market.
- Pipeline is deep — dozen+ insurance AI apps in approval pipeline across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. Platform shift, not one-off.
- Junior broker roles at risk — quoting, comparison, simple placement. The entry-level work that feeds the talent pipeline.
- Margin compression — even if brokers survive, commission rates compress as clients use AI for pre-negotiation leverage.
- Precedent — travel agents, stockbrokers, real estate agents. Every intermediary facing digital comparison tools has seen margin compression.
