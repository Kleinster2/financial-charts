**Pax Silica** — US-led international initiative to secure "trusted" supply chains for semiconductors, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, advanced manufacturing, energy, and logistics. Launched December 12, 2025 at a summit in Washington, D.C. (held at the renamed "Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace"). Coordinated by the [[US Department of State]]. Non-binding declaration signed by an initial group of allies; [[India]] joined February 20, 2026 at the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]].

The name combines *Pax* (Latin for peace) with *Silica* (silicon) — framing semiconductor supply chain security as foundational to a new kind of peace/stability.

## What it covers

Six cooperation pillars spanning the full technology stack:

1. **Critical minerals** — mining, refining, processing (reducing China dependence)
2. **Energy** — power for data centers, clean energy for AI compute
3. **Advanced manufacturing** — chip fabrication, equipment, materials
4. **Semiconductors** — design, fabrication, packaging, testing
5. **AI infrastructure** — compute, data centers, models
6. **Logistics** — shipping, supply chain mapping, protection

Pacific Forum analyst Akhil Ramesh: *"Economic security today is inseparable from control over energy, critical minerals, high-end manufacturing, and advanced models."*

## Strategic context

### Why it matters

Pax Silica formalizes the US strategy of building a **"trusted" parallel supply chain** that excludes China:

- **China produces** ~60% of rare earths, dominates mineral processing, and is building indigenous chip capacity
- **US export controls** (Oct 2022, Jan 2025) restricted China's access to advanced chips and equipment
- **CHIPS Act** ($52B) funds domestic US fabrication but can't cover the full global supply chain
- Pax Silica extends the logic: the **entire stack** (minerals → chips → AI) needs allied coordination

### Notably absent
- **China** — the implicit adversary
- **Taiwan** — conspicuously absent despite [[TSMC]]'s foundry dominance; likely due to diplomatic sensitivity (One China policy)
- **EU as a bloc** — individual European countries (Greece, UK, Netherlands) involved, not the EU itself

### Relationship to other frameworks

| Framework | Scope | Binding? |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Pax Silica** | Full tech stack (minerals → AI) | Non-binding |
| **CHIPS Act** (US) | Domestic semiconductor manufacturing | Binding (subsidies + guardrails) |
| **Chip 4 Alliance** (US/Japan/Korea/Taiwan) | Semiconductor coordination | Informal |
| **AUKUS** | Defense/security tech (US/UK/Australia) | Treaty |
| **Mineral Security Partnership** | Critical minerals | Informal |
| **AI Safety Summits** (Bletchley/Seoul/Paris/Delhi) | AI governance | Non-binding declarations |

Pax Silica is broader than any of these — it tries to connect the **entire supply chain** from ground (minerals) to cloud (AI models) under one framework.

## Criticism / limitations

- **Non-binding** — no enforcement mechanism; depends on voluntary alignment
- **US-centric** — critics see it as extending US tech hegemony rather than genuine partnership
- **Taiwan gap** — the most critical node in global chip production isn't a member
- **China counter-moves** — China has retaliated to export controls with its own mineral export restrictions (gallium, germanium, antimony)
- **Sriram Krishnan** (White House AI adviser) stated at India summit that US "totally rejects" global AI governance — Pax Silica is about supply chains, not governance
