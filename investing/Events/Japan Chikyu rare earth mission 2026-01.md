**Japan Chikyu rare earth mission** — World's first attempt to continuously lift rare earth mud from 6km depth. Part of Japan's drive to reduce China dependence.

## The mission

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Vessel | Chikyu (drilling-equipped research ship) |
| Departure | Jan 12, 2026 (Shimizu port, Shizuoka) |
| Return | Feb 14, 2026 |
| Location | Minamitori Island (1,900 km SE of Tokyo) |
| Depth | ~6 km (world's first at this depth) |
| Crew | 130 (crew + researchers) |
| Project lead | Shoichi Ishii (government-backed project) |

---

## Project context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment since 2018 | 40B yen (~$250M) |
| Preparation time | 7 years |
| Next milestone | Full-scale mining trial (Feb 2027) |

**Goal**: First domestic Japanese rare earth production capability.

---

## Why this matters

### Japan's China dependence

| Period | China share |
|--------|-------------|
| 2010 | ~90% |
| 2026 | ~60% |

Reduction achieved through:
- [[Lynas Rare Earths]] partnership with Sojitz (Australia)
- Rare earth recycling
- Manufacturing processes using less REE

### Heavy rare earth problem

Japan remains almost 100% dependent on China for heavy rare earths like [[Dysprosium]] — critical for EV motor magnets. This project could change that.

---

## Geopolitical context

### China pressure

- **Jan 2026**: China banned dual-use exports to Japan including rare earths (see [[China-Japan relations]])
- **WSJ reports**: Beijing restricting rare earth exports to Japan more broadly
- **June 2025**: Chinese naval fleet observed near Minamitori Island during survey operations

**Quote from project lead Ishii**: "We feel a strong sense of crisis that such intimidating actions were taken."

### G7 response

G7 finance ministers discussed rare earth supplies at Washington meeting (Jan 12, 2026) — same day as Chikyu departure.

---

## Economic viability

Previously viewed as uneconomical due to high costs. However:
- If China supply disruption continues
- If buyers accept higher prices
- Project could become viable in coming years

**Analyst view (Mitsubishi UFJ Research)**: Economics improving as China weaponizes supply.

## What to watch

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Mission success | Technology proven for 6km depth |
| Feb 2027 trial | Commercial viability test |
| China response | Further naval activity, diplomatic pressure |
| Reserve disclosure | Project scale and timeline |

## Investment implications

**If successful**:
- Reduces Japan vulnerability to [[Rare earth leverage]]
- Long-term (5-10+ year) play
- Benefits Japanese defense, auto, electronics sectors

**Beneficiaries**:
- Japanese rare earth processing capability
- Companies with Minamitori mining exposure
- Alternative to [[MP Materials]], [[Lynas Rare Earths]]
