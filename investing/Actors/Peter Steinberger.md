## Career

**PSPDFKit (2011-2024):** Bootstrapped PDF framework company for 13 years. Raised first outside capital ($116M) in Oct 2021. Nearly 1B people used apps powered by PSPDFKit. Successfully exited to [[Insight Partners]] for $100M+.

**3-year sabbatical (2022-2025):** After the PSPDFKit exit, Steinberger deliberately stepped away from tech. Traveled, did therapy, experimented with ayahuasca, and went through what he described as "a period of deep searching." Returned to coding because AI pulled him back. *(Source: Lex Fridman interview, Feb 2026)*

**43 failed projects:** Before [[OpenClaw]], Steinberger cycled through 43 different project ideas. OpenClaw was #44. *(Source: Lex Fridman interview, Feb 2026)*

**OpenClaw (2025-2026):** Created as personal AI agent project (originally Clawdbot/Moltbot). Went viral — 200K GitHub stars, 2M visitors/week. Moving to independent foundation as Steinberger joins OpenAI.

**OpenAI (Feb 2026-):** Hired to "drive the next generation of personal agents." Mission: build an agent "even my mum can use." [[Sam Altman]] called him "a genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" and said "we expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

## Development style & philosophy

Steinberger practices what [[Andrej Karpathy]] calls **"agentic engineering"** — a term he much prefers to "vibe coding." His workflow during OpenClaw development: *(Source: Lex Fridman interview, Feb 2026)*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agents running simultaneously | 4–10 |
| Commits in January 2026 | **6,600** |
| Primary coding method | Talking to AI, not typing |
| Primary model used | [[OpenAI]] Codex |

Built most of OpenClaw's codebase by directing AI agents rather than writing code directly. Described himself as "the biggest unpaid promoter for Codex" — generating tremendous value for OpenAI without compensation by publicly demonstrating what Codex could do.

### Codex vs Claude assessment (Lex Fridman, 3-hour episode)

Compared GPT Codex 5.3 and Claude Opus 4.6 side by side:

| Dimension | [[OpenAI]] Codex | [[Anthropic]] Claude |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Approach | Reads large volume of code upfront before starting | More interactive but sometimes writes code without reading context |
| Style | Less interactive, drier; comes back after ~20 min silence with job done | Stronger role-playing, more conversational |
| Weakness | Less interactive | "Impulsive" — may skip context |
| Bottom line | Reliable and efficient for experienced developers | Better for interactive workflows |

His conclusion: skilled developers get strong results with any top model; differences come down to post-training goals, not raw intelligence.

### On money and motivation

> "I don't do this for the money. I don't give a f." *(Lex Fridman interview)*

Posture of complete optionality: "The beauty is if it doesn't work out, I can just do my own thing again." Zero desperation gave him more leverage than most acqui-hire candidates.

## Significance

Steinberger represents a new pattern: **open-source agent builder → frontier lab hire**. OpenAI is acquiring agent expertise from the grassroots/open-source community rather than building purely in-house. His PSPDFKit background (developer tools, SDKs, cross-platform frameworks) maps directly to building agent infrastructure.

Notable: tweeted about getting access to [[Aardvark]] (OpenAI's security agent) on Feb 14, 2026 — one day before the hire announcement.
