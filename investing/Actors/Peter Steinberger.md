## Career

**PSPDFKit (2011-2024):** Bootstrapped PDF framework company for 13 years. Raised first outside capital ($116M) in Oct 2021. Nearly 1B people used apps powered by PSPDFKit. Successfully exited.

**OpenClaw (2025-2026):** Created as personal AI agent project (originally Clawdbot/Moltbot). Went viral — 100K+ GitHub stars, 2M visitors/week. Moving to independent foundation as Steinberger joins OpenAI.

**OpenAI (Feb 2026-):** Hired to "drive the next generation of personal agents." [[Sam Altman]] called him "a genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" and said "we expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings."

## Significance

Steinberger represents a new pattern: **open-source agent builder → frontier lab hire**. OpenAI is acquiring agent expertise from the grassroots/open-source community rather than building purely in-house. His PSPDFKit background (developer tools, SDKs, cross-platform frameworks) maps directly to building agent infrastructure.

Notable: tweeted about getting access to [[Aardvark]] (OpenAI's security agent) on Feb 14, 2026 — one day before the hire announcement.
