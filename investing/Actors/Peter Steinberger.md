## OpenClaw

Created as personal assistant "Clawd" — a space lobster character. Runs on his Mac Mini at 3 AM drafting newsletters, responding to messages. Personal tool → open-source phenomenon.

**The rebrand chaos (Jan 2026):**
- **Clawdbot** → **Moltbot** (Jan 27, [[Anthropic]] C&D over "Clawd" trademark)
- **Moltbot** → **OpenClaw** (Jan 30)

Now 100,000+ GitHub stars, 2M visitors in one week. One of fastest-growing open-source projects in GitHub history.

Core team: Steinberger + Mario Zechner (@badlogicc, security/Pi).
