## China problem

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| China revenue decline | -27% in 2024 |
| **Guochao** | Chinese nationalist consumer trend favoring domestic brands |
| **THAAD** | 2016 US missile deployment in Korea → Chinese boycott of Korean brands |
| Daigou collapse | Chinese reseller channel dried up |
| Strategy | Deliberate pullback, focusing on profitable channels only |

Amorepacific's China exposure was ~40% of international revenue at peak. The deliberate exit is painful but necessary.

## K-beauty thesis

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Global K-beauty market | ~$15B, growing +10%+ |
| US K-beauty | Fastest-growing beauty segment |
| [[TikTok]] driver | COSRX, Laneige viral on social |
| Multi-step routine | Evangelized globally |
| Ingredients focus | Snail mucin, ginseng, centella |

K-beauty went from niche Asian trend to mainstream global beauty category. Amorepacific is the largest pure-play beneficiary.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Americas +83%, EMEA +229% — global pivot working
- Operating profit +104% — leverage appearing
- K-beauty structural tailwind (Gen Z adoption)
- COSRX acquisition (2023) perfectly positioned for social commerce
- China reduction = healthier, more diversified business
- Stock depressed from 2021 highs — recovery play

**Bear:**
- China -27% — was 40% of international, now a drag
- Korea domestic declining (duty-free collapse)
- Revenue still roughly flat over 3 years (growth is from one-time COSRX consolidation)
- K-beauty competition intensifying (many brands, low barriers)
- Guochao trend may permanently reduce Korea brand appeal in China
- Family-controlled, governance concerns for minority holders
