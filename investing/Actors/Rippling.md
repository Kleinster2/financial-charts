## Product

[[Parker Conrad]] coined the term "compound startup" — the idea is to build many integrated products on a single shared data layer rather than perfecting one product and expanding later. At Rippling, that shared layer is a unified employee data record. Onboarding a new hire in the HR module automatically provisions their laptop, sets up SSO access to apps, issues a corporate card, and enrolls them in benefits. Competitors like [[Gusto]] or [[BambooHR]] handle one or two of those and rely on third-party integrations for the rest — which means data lives in silos and changes don't propagate.

The tradeoff: building 24+ products simultaneously requires heavy upfront investment (hence ~$100M/year burn), and any individual module may be less polished than a best-of-breed competitor focused solely on that category. The bet is that integration value outweighs feature depth for most mid-market buyers — and the switching costs compound with each module adopted, since ripping out the platform means migrating everything at once.

24+ modules across three clouds:

HR Cloud — payroll (US + global), HRIS, benefits, recruiting (ATS), performance management, LMS, time & attendance, scheduling, headcount planning, surveys.

IT Cloud — identity/SSO, device management (Mac/Windows/iOS), app management, inventory.

Finance Cloud (Spend) — corporate cards, expense management, bill pay, travel, procurement.

Platform — Employer of Record (185+ countries), global contractor payments, PEO, Workflow Studio (automation), unified analytics.

Pricing is modular — base HRIS at ~$8/employee/month, full stack $30-50+/employee/month. Customers start with ~7 SKUs on average and expand. 10+ product lines each exceed $1M ARR, with new products typically reaching that threshold within 5-6 months.

## Unit economics

- Net dollar retention: ~200% (May 2022) vs ~120% SaaS average
- CAC payback: 17 months overall, 10 months for cross-sell (vs 28-month industry average)
- PEO retention: 99.5% YoY (fall 2024)

The compound model drives exceptional expansion — customers who start with HR naturally adopt IT and finance modules, doubling spend year-over-year.

## Deel corporate espionage lawsuit

March 2025 — Rippling sued [[Deel]] in California, alleging Deel planted a spy (Keith O'Brien) in Rippling's Dublin office in 2023. O'Brien allegedly conducted 6,000+ Slack searches, funneling sales pipeline data, product roadmaps, and customer information to Deel executives. Payment trail routed through the personal bank account of the wife of Deel's COO, with subsequent payments in cryptocurrency. O'Brien confessed in Irish court via sworn statement.

June 2025 — amended complaint added RICO charges, alleging Deel CEO Alex Bouazizi personally directed the scheme and Deel targeted at least four other competitors.

Deel counter-sued, alleging Rippling's "Competitive Intelligence Manager" infiltrated Deel's platform 58 times under a fake company name.

January 2026 — DOJ opened a criminal investigation — grand jury subpoenas issued by US Attorney for the Northern District of California. Potentially material for [[Deel]], which was preparing for a 2026 IPO.

## Timeline

| Jan 2017 | Seed round, launched out of [[Y Combinator]] |
| Aug 2020 | Hit unicorn status at $1B (Series B) |
| May 2022 | Series D at $11.25B, ~200% NDR |
| Mar 2023 | [[SVB]] crisis — Conrad raised $500M in 12 hours to cover customer payroll |

## IPO outlook

No IPO imminent. Conrad told CNBC (May 2025) the company is not planning a near-term listing, citing the need to demonstrate profitability alongside growth. Most analysts project 2027-2028, contingent on profitability trajectory, tech IPO market conditions, and Deel litigation resolution. Pre-IPO shares trade on Forge Global, Nasdaq Private Market, and EquityZen.

## Investment relevance

- Compound startup model is the core thesis — 24+ products on shared data creates switching costs and expansion revenue that standalone HR vendors can't match
- ~200% NDR is among the highest in SaaS, suggesting deep product-market fit
- Deel litigation could weaken the primary competitor in global payroll/EOR, especially with DOJ involvement
- Path to $1B revenue by 2026 would be a milestone, but profitability timeline remains unclear at ~$100M/year burn
- [[Parker Conrad]]'s [[Zenefits]] history is a risk factor investors monitor — though Rippling's execution has been markedly different
