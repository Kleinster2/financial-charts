## Assessment

**Implementer, not architect:** Analysts describe He as an executor of Xi's will rather than an independent policymaker. [[Stanford]]'s Xu Chenggang: "The only economic czar in China is Xi Jinping, the czar in all aspects."

**Why he matters:** His 40-year relationship with Xi provides unparalleled access and trust. When He speaks to foreign leaders, he speaks with Xi's authority.
