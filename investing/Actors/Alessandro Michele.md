## Gucci transformation (2015-2022)

**The breakthrough:** In January 2015, CEO Marco Bizzarri gave Michele one week to reshape a menswear show. The result was so striking that Kering appointed him creative director two days later.

**Results:**
- Q1 2017: 51% revenue increase — strongest in 20 years
- Transformed Gucci from stale heritage brand to cultural phenomenon
- Defined "maximalist" aesthetic that influenced entire industry
- Strong partnership with CEO Bizzarri gave him creative freedom

**The fade:** By 2021-2022, growth slowed as the maximalist look saturated. Michele departed November 2022 after seven years.

**Legacy:** Revenue roughly tripled during his tenure. Proved that bold creative vision can drive commercial success at scale.

## Valentino (2024–)

**Context:** Replacing Pierpaolo Piccioli (25 years at house) at a struggling brand. Revenue declining, ownership in limbo.

**Early output:**
- Resort 2025 lookbook (Jun 2024): 132 looks blending menswear/womenswear with Valentino archives
- SS25 runway "Pavillon des Folies" (Sep 2024): 85 looks, eclectic maximalism, 1960s-80s references

**The question:** Can Michele reinvent without repeating? His aesthetic is the opposite of Valentino Garavani's refined restraint. The brand needs commercial results, not just critical acclaim.

## Design philosophy

Describes himself as an "art archaeologist" rather than creative director — clothes need historical context.

**Influences:** Cinema, theater, post-punk, glamour, vintage

**Signature:** Gender-fluid silhouettes, jewel tones, layering, mixing high/low references, romantic maximalism
