## Strategic role within KKR

Same playbook as [[Athene]] for [[Apollo]]:
1. Global Atlantic collects long-duration insurance liabilities (annuity premiums, PRT)
2. KKR manages the float — deploying into [[Private credit]], infrastructure, real assets
3. Spread between investment returns and liability cost = earnings
4. No fundraising cycles, no redemptions — permanent capital

**KKR's math:** Insurance assets provide stable, fee-rich capital base. KKR grew to $1.3T AUM (Jan 2026) with record $220B new capital raised in 2025, significantly driven by insurance inflows.

## Japan expansion (2025)

Japan Post Insurance invested $2B into a co-investment vehicle managed by Global Atlantic:
- Japan Post owns majority stake in the entity
- Invests across all Global Atlantic businesses (annuities, life, reinsurance)
- Part of broader KKR/Apollo push into Japan's $5.8T life insurance savings pool

See [[Reinsurance sidecars]] for the sidecar structure enabling this.
