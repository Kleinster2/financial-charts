**Illycaffè** — Italian premium espresso company. Family-controlled since 1933. B Corp certified. Eyeing US production and potential IPO.

---

## Why Illycaffè matters

Premium single-brand coffee with global distribution, vertically integrated from bean sourcing to retail. One of few scaled specialty coffee companies still private and family-controlled — a potential IPO candidate in a sector dominated by [[Starbucks]], [[Nestlé]] (Nespresso), and [[JAB Holding]].

## History

Francesco Illy, a Hungarian-born businessman in Trieste, founded the company in 1933. He invented the modern espresso machine's precursor and pioneered pressurized packaging to preserve coffee freshness. The company has remained family-controlled across three generations — Francesco's grandson [[Andrea Illy]] has served as chairman since 2005 (CEO 1994-2016).

## Business model

Illycaffè operates a multi-channel premium model:

| Channel | Details |
|---------|---------|
| HoReCa | Hotels, restaurants, cafés — core B2B channel |
| Retail | Supermarkets, specialty stores (silver/red pressurized cans) |
| E-commerce | Direct online sales (+18% YoY in US, 2024) |
| illy Caffè | 250+ owned/franchise single-brand cafés globally |
| Machines | Branded espresso machines and capsule systems |

Key differentiator: uses 100% Arabica beans only, sourced directly from growers at a premium above market prices. Single-blend philosophy (vs. competitors' multi-SKU approach).

## Ownership and IPO path

In late 2019-2020, [[Rhône Capital]] (US private equity) acquired a ~20% minority stake at a valuation exceeding €1B. The Illy family retains majority control.

An IPO has been discussed for years but no timeline set. Andrea Illy has signaled ambitions to double the business in the "short to medium term." The company is building scale — particularly in the US — ahead of any potential listing. Board renewed in April 2025 through 2027 (Illy and Scocchia reconfirmed; new directors include former Borsa Italiana CEO Raffaele Jerusalmi as Vice Chairman).

## US expansion

The US is the strategic priority market. Plans include:
- Starting US-based production in 2026
- €120M investment plan to double production and logistics capacity in Trieste
- Strengthening distribution network and brand awareness

---

## Sustainability

First Italian coffee company to earn [[B Corp]] certification (2021). Chairman Andrea Illy has emphasized "regenerative quality" as a 2026 theme — measurement "from soil to cup" as the competitive standard. Direct sourcing model pays farmers above-market premiums.
