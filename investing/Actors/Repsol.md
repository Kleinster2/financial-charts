## Energy transition & catalysts

**2024-2027 Strategic Plan:**
- EUR 16-19B net investment; >35% allocated to low-carbon
- Iberian Peninsula: 60% of capex; US: 25%
- Target: 30% increase in cash generated per barrel by 2027
- Net-zero by 2050

**Key projects (2026):**
- **Pikka Phase 1** — first oil early 2026, 80 kboe/d
- **Puertollano renewable fuels plant** — 200k tonnes/year capacity
- **Green hydrogen** — 100 MW electrolyzer at Cartagena (IPCEI-funded)
- **Sines biomethane plant** (Portugal)
- **Upstream liquidity event** — potential IPO or reverse merger with [[APA Corporation]]; exploratory talks for NYSE listing

**Shareholder returns target:** EUR 10B through 2027 (30-35% of CFFO); EUR 700M buyback in 2025; dividend rising to >EUR 1.00/share in 2026.

## Competitive positioning

| Company | Mkt cap | Prod. (kboe/d) | Renewables | Posture |
|---------|---------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| [[Shell]] | ~$200B | ~2,700 | ~4 GW | Retreated from renewables |
| [[TotalEnergies]] | ~$150B | ~2,500 | ~19 GW | Most aggressive green buildout |
| [[BP]] | ~$90B | ~2,300 | Scaled back | Pivoted back to fossil fuels |
| [[Eni]] | ~$50B | ~1,700 | Bio-refinery | Mediterranean gas focus |
| **Repsol** | **~$23B** | **~550** | **~5 GW** | **Balanced; renewable fuels niche** |

Repsol's edge: renewable fuels leadership (Nexa Diesel), dominant Iberian refining position, US-facing growth via upstream IPO path. Smallest major but highest dividend yield in the group.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Pikka Phase 1 adds ~40 kboe/d net production in 2026
- Upstream IPO/relisting could unlock value (EIG 2022 valuation: $19B vs ~$23B total mkt cap)
- Renewable fuels differentiation — ahead of peers
- Cheap vs European majors on production multiple
- Rising dividend (EUR 0.975 → >EUR 1.00 → EUR 1.10 by 2027)

**Bear:**
- Oil price sensitivity — net income fell 34% in 9M 2025
- Rising net debt (+EUR 1.2B since June 2025)
- Iberian concentration (60% of investment) — single-country regulatory risk
- Production declining: 549 vs 571 kboe/d YoY (Eagle Ford decline, divestitures)
- Upstream IPO/APA merger is exploratory; may not materialize
