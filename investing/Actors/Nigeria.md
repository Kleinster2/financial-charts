**Nigeria** — [[Africa]]'s most populous nation (237M). Solar revolution underway as communities bypass failing national grid. Major recipient of Chinese investment ($20B gas city).

## Why Nigeria matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | 237 million |
| Without power access | ~90 million (38%) |
| National grid capacity | ~4 GW |
| Generator capacity | ~75 GW (diesel/gasoline) |
| Solar imports (2024) | **1,721 MW** (5% of demand) |

**Context:** More people without power access than any other nation on Earth.

## Solar revolution

**Transformation from diesel dependence to distributed solar:**

| Metric | 2021 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|
| Solar imports | <500 MW | **1,721 MW** |
| Sun King sales | 3,000 kits/month | **75,000 kits/month** |

Nigeria is #2 in [[Africa]] for solar imports (after South [[Africa]]).

**Muhammad Wakil (GEAPP):** "Solar is coming in to replace a lot of that inefficient individual power generation. And it's happening for residential, it's happening at the commercial level."

## Key solar players

| Company | Role | Nigeria presence |
|---------|------|------------------|
| [[Husk Power Systems]] | World's biggest minigrid operator | ~70 systems, raising $400M |
| [[Sun King]] | World's largest off-grid solar supplier | 75,000 kits/month |
| Stanbic IBTC | Local lender | Funding Sun King |

## Investment flows

| Source | Amount | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| World Bank (Mission 300) | $750M | Power to 300M Africans by 2030 |
| [[Japan]], [[France]], AfDB | $1.1B (in talks) | Additional solar funding |
| IFC | — | Sun King investment |
| **China (CNCEC)** | **$20B** | Gas city project |

**Why Nigeria attracts capital:**
- Market size (237M people)
- Favorable regulations (cost-recovery pricing allowed)
- Grid failure creates demand

**Contrast with Tanzania:** Husk left in 2022 after edict requiring minigrid operators to match government-subsidized utility rates.

## National grid failure

| Metric | Nigeria | South [[Africa]] |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Grid capacity | ~4 GW | ~25 GW |
| Population | 237M | 60M |
| Per capita grid | **0.017 kW** | 0.42 kW |

Grid built mostly since 1960s, powered by natural gas. Woefully inadequate.

**Result:** 75 GW of diesel/gasoline generators — expensive, noisy, polluting.

## Chinese investment

**$20B gas city project (CNCEC + Alpha Grip):**

Part of broader Chinese push into [[Africa]]. See [[Capital flow reversal]] — China shifting from trophy assets to greenfield projects in Global South.

**Nigeria = top China trade partner in [[Africa]]:**
- One of fastest-growing importers of Chinese goods
- [[Oil]]/gas processing facilities — multi-billion BRI contracts
- [[Consumer]] goods flooding in (electronics, vehicles, textiles)

See [[China-Africa trade]] for full context.

## Carbon market framework (Jan 2026)

**President Tinubu approved large-scale carbon trading framework:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue target | **$3B/year by 2030** |
| Current projects | 57 voluntary carbon projects |
| Credits issued | 5.8M tons |
| Net zero target | 2060 |
| Emissions cuts | By 2035 |

**Sectors:** Energy, agriculture, forestry, waste, industrial

**Phased approach:**
1. Voluntary carbon market + international trading (first)
2. Domestic ETS + carbon tax (later)

**Incentives:**
- Tax exemptions on carbon credit revenue (up to 10 years)
- Accelerated capital allowances for low-carbon assets
- R&D deductions for emissions-reduction projects

**Infrastructure:**
- National carbon registry
- Mandatory emissions reporting for companies
- NCCC oversight (chaired by president)

**Tenioye Majekodunmi (NCCC DG):** Carbon markets are "a key part of the country's economic strategy, as well as a tool for attracting foreign capital."

**Context:** Zimbabwe, [[Kenya]], Malawi also regulating carbon markets. Global carbon markets shrunk 2/3 since 2021 (quality concerns, corporate pullback). But BloombergNEF forecasts 20-35x supply growth by 2050.

## Quality of life impact

**Akanu community (Ohafia district):**
- Lost grid access in 2020 (never repaired)
- Now solar-powered streetlights
- Business hours extended to 10pm
- "What I used to sell in a week, I can sell in three days"

**Ohafia Deputy Mayor Eme Iro:** "When grid electricity returns to this area, it's only going to be an alternative."

| Without power | 90M (38%) |
| Solar imports (2024) | 1,721 MW |
| Grid capacity | ~4 GW |
