| Mid-2025 | ~6.0% | Managers sold 48.5% of position to diversify |
| Dec 2025 | 11.4% | SpaceX revalued 87% — position restored to prior weight |
| Jan 21, 2026 | 11.5% | Larger than strategy allows per Chair |

Chair Tom Burnet: position had grown to more than 10%, twice the next largest, larger than strategy allows. Managers sold nearly half, then revaluation undid the diversification.
