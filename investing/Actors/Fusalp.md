# Fusalp

French luxury skiwear and lifestyle brand founded 1952 in Annecy by two tailors — name is shorthand for "fuseau des Alpes" (Alpine stretch pants). Invented the ski stirrup pant and the competition one-piece suit worn by French national teams in the 1960s (Goitschel sisters at 1964 Innsbruck Olympics, Jean-Claude Killy at 1968 Grenoble). Declined for decades before revival — acquired 2014 by Sophie and Philippe Lacoste (grandchildren of [[Lacoste]] founder René Lacoste) after their family sold Lacoste SA to [[Maus Frères]] in 2012. Revenue grew from €6M (2014) to €52M (FY2022/23), targeting €100M by FY2025/26. ~55 boutiques globally, up from 3 in 2015. New CEO Pascal Conte-Jodra (ex-[[Hermès]], ex-[[Marc Jacobs]]) appointed Sept 2024.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Extraordinary growth trajectory (€6M → €52M in 8 years, ~30% CAGR)
- Authentic heritage (1952, Olympic pedigree) that can't be manufactured
- Lacoste family brings luxury brand-building DNA
- Expanding from ski into year-round lifestyle = larger TAM
- Investor roster signals quality (Chanel heir, Galeries Lafayette family, ex-LVMH executives)
- US and Asia still early — significant international runway

Bear:
- Private, limited financial disclosure
- Ski apparel is seasonal and weather-dependent
- €100M target is ambitious — requires near-doubling again
- New CEO transition (Sept 2024) — execution risk
- Competitive space: [[Moncler]], [[Bogner]], [[Kjus]], [[Perfect Moment]] all targeting luxury ski
- France still ~70% of sales — concentration risk
