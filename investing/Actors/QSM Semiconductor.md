## Why QSM matters

[[Mexico]]'s chip manufacturing pioneer:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | $12M |
| Location | Querétaro |
| Capacity | 10,000 wafers/year |
| Jobs | 160 |
| Status | Groundbreaking Q1 2025 |

---

## First Mexican fab

**Historic milestone:**
- First silicon wafer plant in [[Mexico]]
- Legacy node chips (not cutting edge)
- [[Consumer]] electronics focus
- TVs, appliances, automotive

[[Mexico]] finally making chips domestically.

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2024 | $[[3M]] development center opened |
| Q1 2025 | Groundbreaking |
| Late 2025/2026 | Production begins |
| 2030 | Scale-up target |

## Business units

| Unit | Function |
|------|----------|
| CEI2 | Engineering & Innovation |
| CEDIC | IC Design Center |
| FAB1 | Manufacturing plant |

Full domestic value chain.

## Current model

**Before fab:**
- Design chips in [[Mexico]]
- Send to [[Asia]] for manufacturing
- Import finished chips
- Costly, slow

Fab changes this.

---

## Context

**[[Mexico]]'s chip reality:**
- $23.5B semiconductor imports
- Almost zero domestic production
- QSM = first real fab
- Long way to go

$12M is tiny vs global fabs ($20B+), but it's a start.

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable:**
- Private Mexican company
- Small scale
- Symbolic importance
- Watch for growth

## Cap table / Investors

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private (Mexican company) |
| Total investment | $12M |
| Funding | Government grants + private |

**Note:** Limited public disclosure. First Mexican fab is largely symbolic. May have government backing via CONACYT or economic development programs.
