## Acquisition by Palo Alto Networks

Announced mid-2025, approved by CyberArk shareholders Nov 13, 2025, closed Feb 11, 2026. Terms: $45.00 cash + 2.2005 PANW shares per CYBR ordinary share.

### Strategic rationale

Machine identities now outnumber human identities 80:1 across enterprise environments. 75% of organizations acknowledge overly permissive privilege models. ~90% have suffered identity-centric breach. CyberArk's PAM, identity provider, and governance tools fill a critical gap in Palo Alto's zero trust architecture — embedding into Prisma and Cortex platforms.

### Regulatory remedies

Behavioral remedies required for approval: CyberArk tools must remain interoperable with third-party security vendors. Addresses concern that merger could create a walled garden that stifles competition.

### Post-acquisition restructuring

~700 CyberArk employees notified of dismissal (incl. ~100 in [[Israel]]). Termination dates range 3-12 months. Retention bonuses offered; severance packages of 4-5 months salary. Integration costs are primary driver behind Palo Alto's Q3 FY26 EPS guidance miss ($0.78-0.80 vs $0.92 consensus).

### TASE secondary listing

Palo Alto Networks announced intent to pursue secondary listing on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under ticker "CYBR" — tribute to CyberArk's Israeli heritage and Israel's position as a cybersecurity hub.
