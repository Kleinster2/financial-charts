## Acquisition by Palo Alto Networks

Announced mid-2025, approved by CyberArk shareholders Nov 13, 2025, closed Feb 11, 2026. Terms: $45.00 cash + 2.2005 PANW shares per CYBR ordinary share.

### Strategic rationale

Machine identities now outnumber human identities 80:1 across enterprise environments. 75% of organizations acknowledge overly permissive privilege models. ~90% have suffered identity-centric breach. CyberArk's PAM, identity provider, and governance tools fill a critical gap in Palo Alto's zero trust architecture — embedding into Prisma and Cortex platforms.

### Regulatory remedies

Behavioral remedies required for approval: CyberArk tools must remain interoperable with third-party security vendors. Addresses concern that merger could create a walled garden that stifles competition.

### Post-acquisition restructuring

~700 CyberArk employees notified of dismissal (incl. ~100 in [[Israel]]). Termination dates range 3-12 months. Retention bonuses offered; severance packages of 4-5 months salary. Integration costs are primary driver behind Palo Alto's Q3 FY26 EPS guidance miss ($0.78-0.80 vs $0.92 consensus).

### TASE secondary listing

Palo Alto Networks announced intent to pursue secondary listing on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under ticker "CYBR" — tribute to CyberArk's Israeli heritage and Israel's position as a cybersecurity hub.

## Price history

![[cybr-vs-panw-price-chart.png]]

*CYBR vs PANW normalized from CYBR IPO (Sep 2014). Both ended near +280% — CyberArk's decade-long run validated the $25B acquisition price. CYBR's sharper drawdowns (2019, 2022) reflect the smaller-cap volatility that PANW's platform scale eventually absorbed.*

| Milestone | CYBR price | Date |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| IPO offer price | $16.00 | Sep 24, 2014 |
| First-day close | ~$31.00 (nearly doubled) | Sep 24, 2014 |
| Final trading day | $408.85 | Feb 13, 2026 |
| Total return from offer | ~+2,455% | |

## Funding

~$59M total pre-IPO equity raised across four rounds. Six series of preferred shares converted to ordinary at IPO.

| Round | Date | Amount | Lead / key investors | Valuation |
|-------|------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Seed / Series A | Jul 2000 | $6M | JPMorgan, Nomura, Seed Capital Partners (SoftBank/Hotbank affiliate) | Unknown |
| Series A/B (institutional) | Mar 2002 | ~$12M | [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] (lead), [[Vertex Ventures]] Israel, JPMorgan, IDB Invest, SoftBank/Seed Capital | ~$22-24M |
| Series B extension | May 2005 | $3.5M | 2 investors (likely existing shareholders) | Unknown |
| Venture debt | 2006 | Undisclosed | Plenus Venture Lending (Viola Partners affiliate) | N/A (debt) |
| Secondary + growth | Dec 2011 | $40M | [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] + [[Goldman Sachs]] Merchant Banking | ~$200M |
| IPO | Sep 24, 2014 | $88.5M net | Goldman Sachs (lead UW), Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BofA, UBS | ~$473M at offer |

The March 2002 round nearly didn't happen. CyberArk had signed an MOU with SoftBank Europe for investment — the closing date was September 11, 2001. The deal collapsed. Cohen could barely make payroll. Months later, Vertex Ventures took a meeting and the round came together with JVP leading.

The December 2011 round was transformative: mixed secondary and primary capital. JVP increased its stake from ~26% to ~47%. [[Erel Margalit]] became chairman. Goldman Sachs' David Campbell joined the board. CyberArk had ~1,000 enterprise customers at the time, including 8 of the top 10 global banks and 35%+ of the Fortune 100.

Pre-IPO ownership (at F-1 filing):

| Shareholder | Shares | % |
|------------|--------|---|
| [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] entities | 8,959,770 | 29.1% |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] entities | 4,700,582 | 15.3% |
| [[Vertex Ventures]] Israel | 2,083,899 | 6.8% |
| Amnon Shoshani (Cabaret Security) | 1,520,661 | 5.0% |
| Udi Mokady | 1,008,610 | 3.2% |

## Financials

![[cybr-fundamentals-chart.png]]

*Revenue 38x growth ($36M → $1.36B) over 14 years. Net income turned negative in 2020 as CyberArk invested in SaaS transition — classic perpetual-license-to-subscription pivot that depressed near-term profitability while accelerating recurring revenue.*

| FY | Revenue | Net income | Operating income |
|----|---------|------------|-----------------|
| 2014 | $102M | $9M | $20M |

| 2017 | $261M | $16M | $20M |
| 2018 | $343M | $47M | $47M |

## Evolution

- 1999 — Co-founded in [[Israel]] by Alon Cohen and Udi Mokady. Cohen (CEO/chairman) conceived the idea from IDF service at Mamram, where a soldier accessed his personal files — exposing privileged-access vulnerabilities
- 2000 — $6M seed from JPMorgan, Nomura, Seed Capital Partners
- 2001-2002 — Near-death experience: SoftBank Europe investment MOU set to close Sep 11, 2001. Deal collapsed. Months of near-insolvency before [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] led ~$12M round (Mar 2002) at ~$22-24M valuation, with [[Vertex Ventures]] Israel
- 2005-2011 — Built dominant PAM franchise. ~1,000 enterprise customers by 2011, including 8 of top 10 global banks and 35%+ of Fortune 100
- 2011 — JVP and [[Goldman Sachs]] led $40M secondary + growth round at ~$200M valuation. JVP's stake rose from ~26% to ~47%. [[Erel Margalit]] became chairman
- 2014 — IPO on NASDAQ at $16/share offer price. Stock nearly doubled on day one to ~$31. [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] held ~29% at filing, Goldman ~15%
- 2020 — Began SaaS transition. Revenue growth continued but net income turned negative as perpetual license revenue shifted to subscriptions
- 2021-2023 — Expanded beyond PAM into identity provider, workforce identity, secrets management, and cloud access. Operating losses peaked at -$153M (2022)
- 2024 — Revenue crossed $1B. Platform thesis validated — no longer just PAM but full identity security stack
- 2025 — [[Palo Alto Networks]] announced $25B acquisition. Largest cybersecurity deal ever. Revenue reached $1.36B
- Feb 2026 — Deal closed. ~700 employees laid off. PANW plans TASE secondary listing under "CYBR" ticker

## Analysis

The 2020-2025 losses are a SaaS transition artifact, not a business deterioration. Two mechanics drove it:

Gross margin compression: 85.7% (2018-19) → 74.2% (2025). Perpetual licenses carry near-100% margins; subscription/cloud delivery has infrastructure costs. The ~11-point drop on $1.36B revenue equals ~$150M in lost gross profit vs. the old margin structure.

OpEx explosion: $308M (2019) → $1,115M (2025) — 3.6x increase while revenue only tripled. Platform expansion from single PAM product to six-product identity security suite (identity provider, workforce identity, secrets management, cloud access), plus stock-based compensation growth as headcount and stock price rose together.

The pattern is textbook for enterprise software SaaS transitions — Adobe, Autodesk, PTC all went through the same profitability valley. Revenue accelerates (subscriptions compound), but the P&L looks ugly for 3-5 years. CyberArk was still in the valley when Palo Alto bought them — which is arguably why they got acquired at $25B rather than a higher multiple. PANW could absorb those losses into their larger platform and extract the compounding recurring revenue stream.

The funding arc tells a parallel story: near-death in Sep 2001, JVP rescue at ~$22M valuation, patient stake accumulation to 47%, then a decade of compounding to a $25B exit. JVP's willingness to increase ownership through secondaries rather than distribute early — buying more CyberArk at $200M when they could have sold — is the conviction trade that defined the firm.
