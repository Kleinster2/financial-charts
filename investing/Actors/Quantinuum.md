## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Market leader in trapped-ion approach
- Honeywell backing (patient capital, industrial expertise)
- Enterprise customers paying for quantum access
- First major quantum IPO = category-defining
- NVIDIA investor signals AI/quantum convergence

**Bear:**
- Quantum still pre-commercial for most use cases
- Competition from Google, IBM with deep pockets
- Hardware approach may not win long-term
- Revenue likely still small vs valuation
