**Talen Energy** — Independent power producer. Owns Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Amazon deal for 960 MW of nuclear-powered data center capacity.

## Why Talen matters

Talen's Susquehanna deal with [[Amazon]] is the largest nuclear-AI co-location agreement:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Plant | Susquehanna (Pennsylvania) |
| Capacity | 960 MW for Amazon |
| Structure | Direct co-location |
| Significance | Largest nuclear-DC deal |

---

## The Amazon deal

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| Partner | [[Amazon]] / AWS |
| Capacity | 960 MW |
| Location | Adjacent to Susquehanna plant |
| Model | Behind-the-meter co-location |
| Grid bypass | Direct power, avoids transmission |

**Why it matters**: Co-location bypasses grid bottlenecks and transmission costs. Amazon gets reliable baseload power directly.

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Amazon anchor deal de-risks
- Nuclear premium emerging
- Grid congestion benefits co-location
- More hyperscaler deals possible

**Bear:**
- Regulatory scrutiny on co-location
- Single-asset concentration
- Power price volatility
- **BYOG policy risk** — PJM proposals could limit existing-capacity deals

## PJM BYOG risk (Jan 2026)

PJM's "Bring Your Own Generation" proposal is a double-edged sword for Talen:

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Positive** | Susquehanna is *co-location* — Amazon's behind-the-meter approach already aligns with BYOG intent |
| **Negative** | Curtailment rules could affect future deals for existing capacity |
| **Market reaction** | Shares fell sharply (Jan 17) alongside Vistra and Constellation |

**Key difference:** Amazon's Susquehanna deal is *true* co-location (behind the meter), not just a PPA for grid power. This is closer to what PJM wants, but the stock still sold off on BYOG headline risk.
