## Key theses & frameworks

### Granny Shots strategy
Systematic stock-picking approach using factor screens — stocks that score well on multiple quantitative factors simultaneously (like an underhand free throw in basketball: unglamorous but effective). Launched as an ETF (GRNY) — one of the most successful equity ETF launches in recent decades.

### Bitcoin as digital gold
First Wall Street strategist to publish formal [[Bitcoin]] research with valuation framework. Argued BTC is a store of value and inflation hedge. Consistently issued price targets well above consensus.

### Structural equity bull
Argues [[S&P 500]] is in a secular bull market driven by demographics, technology adoption, and [[Federal Reserve]] policy. Rarely if ever turns bearish.

## Track record

### Hits ✅
- COVID bottom call (March 2020) — Said "buy" during the crash when most were panicking. [[Wall Street Journal]] profiled this as a cover story
- 2023 year-end S&P call — Predicted [[S&P 500]] would reach 5,200 in 2024 when index was at ~4,600. Market hit that target
- Bitcoin early adoption — Called for BTC at $25K+ when it was trading under $10K. Vindicated as BTC exceeded $60K
- 2024 S&P 500 target — Among the most bullish on Wall Street, proved correct as market rallied

### Misses ❌
- Bitcoin $25K by 2018 — Predicted BTC would hit $25K by end of 2018; it crashed to ~$3,200 instead
- Perma-bull blind spots — Structural bullishness means he's late to recognize genuine downturns. Didn't adequately warn on 2022 bear market
- COVID misinformation controversy (2020) — Retweeted contested claims about COVID treatments, drawing [[CNN]] criticism
