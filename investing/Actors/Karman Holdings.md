## Business segments

Karman operates across four end markets:

### 1. Hypersonics & Strategic Missile Defense
The core growth driver. Karman builds payload protection and deployment systems, aerodynamic interstage systems, and thermal protection for hypersonic vehicles and missile defense interceptors. This is the segment most exposed to near-peer threat spending ([[China]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]]).

### 2. Tactical Missiles & Integrated Defense Systems
Warheads, propulsion systems, and integrated missile subsystems for tactical applications. Includes advanced penetrator warheads designed for hardened/deeply buried targets — directly relevant to any potential [[Iran]] strike scenario targeting underground nuclear facilities.

### 3. Space & Launch
Payload fairings, interstage structures, and propulsion components for launch vehicles. Serves both government ([[NASA]], [[Space Force]]) and commercial launch customers.

### 4. Maritime Defense (new, via acquisition)
Entered Jan 2026 via [[Seemann Composites]]/MSC acquisition — advanced composite systems for submarines, UUVs/USVs, and strategic naval surface platforms.

## Subsidiaries

- **Aerospace Engineering, LLC** — legacy subsidiary
- **AMRO Fabricating Corporation** — fabrication
- **American Automated Engineering, Inc.** — automated manufacturing
- **Systima Technologies, Inc.** — solid rocket motor nozzles, composites (awarded MDA SHIELD IDIQ contract)
- **Rapid Machine Solutions – Wolcott Design Services, LLC** — precision machining
- **[[Seemann Composites]]** / MSC — maritime composites (acquired Feb 2026)

The company's predecessors have been in business for over 40 years, growing substantially through acquisitions assembled under the Karman brand.

## Key contracts & programs

- **MDA SHIELD IDIQ** (Jan 2026) — Systima facility awarded contract under the Missile Defense Agency's Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense program, with a program ceiling of **$151B**. This is the Golden Dome missile shield initiative. Karman is one of multiple awardees competing for task orders.
- **Pentagon $5M nozzle expansion** (Jan 2026) — DoD awarded Systima $5M to expand solid rocket motor nozzle production capacity, signaling supply-chain criticality.
- **Seemann/MSC acquisition** (closed Feb 2026) — expanded into maritime defense composites; increased incremental term loan to fund the deal. Raised FY2025 and FY2026 revenue guidance post-acquisition.

## Financials

| Metric | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | TTM (Sep 2025) |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $226M | $281M | $345M | $428M |
| Gross margin | 35.8% | 37.6% | 38.3% | 40.0% |
| EBITDA | $55M | $76M | $96M | $105M |
| Operating income | $20M | $48M | $64M | $66M |
| Net income | -$14M | $4M | $13M | $11M |
| FCF | -$27M | $4M | $11M | -$43M |

Revenue has compounded at ~24% annually from FY2022 to TTM. Gross margins expanding steadily (35.8% → 40.0%), demonstrating operating leverage in a fixed-cost manufacturing business. The TTM FCF turned negative (-$43M) due to heavy investment and working capital requirements ahead of production ramp.

Interest expense is significant at ~$46M TTM on $484M debt, consuming most operating income and compressing net margins to just 2.7%. The company's debt/EBITDA of 4.5x is elevated.

## Valuation

At ~$10.7B market cap on $428M TTM revenue, Karman trades at:
- **25x EV/Sales** — extreme for a manufacturing business
- **104x EV/EBITDA** — priced for massive growth acceleration
- **PS ratio of 24x** — comparable to high-growth software, not defense hardware
- **Forward PE of 144x**

Analyst consensus is **Buy** with an average price target of $92.90 (11 analysts). Revenue growth forecast of ~29% annually over 5 years, EPS growth forecast of ~102% annually as operating leverage kicks in.

## Investment thesis

### Bull case
- **Positioned at the tip of the spear**: Karman makes the actual warheads, thermal protection, and propulsion for the weapons systems the US is racing to build against [[China]] and [[Russia]]. Not a prime contractor — a specialist in the hardest engineering problems
- **Massive TAM expansion**: SHIELD ($151B ceiling), Golden Dome missile defense, hypersonics programs, [[AUKUS]] submarine industrial base all represent multi-decade tailwinds
- **Acquisition flywheel**: Management is rolling up niche defense manufacturers (Seemann/MSC most recent) to build a vertically integrated platform. Trive Capital playbook
- **Margin expansion runway**: Gross margins improving 400bp+ over 3 years with scale. As revenue grows and interest expense gets refinanced, net margins should expand significantly
- **Iran/geopolitical catalyst**: Advanced penetrator warheads for bunker-busting are directly relevant if the US or [[Israel]] strikes Iran's underground nuclear facilities. Polymarket shows 67% odds of an Iran strike (Feb 2026)

### Bear case
- **Extreme valuation**: 25x sales and 104x EBITDA for a defense manufacturer is unprecedented. This prices in years of flawless execution and contract wins
- **Debt burden**: $484M debt at 4.5x EBITDA with $46M annual interest. Rising rates or an execution stumble could create distress
- **Negative FCF**: TTM free cash flow is -$43M. The company is investing ahead of revenue, but cash burn at this stage is a risk
- **Customer concentration**: Heavily dependent on [[DoD]] programs that can be delayed, restructured, or cancelled. [[DOGE]] budget cuts are a real risk
- **Insider selling**: CEO Koblinski has sold ~$13M in shares since IPO via 10b5-1 plans
- **Small company, big ambitions**: 1,113 employees competing against primes like [[Lockheed Martin]], [[RTX]], [[Northrop Grumman]] for critical programs

## Stock performance

IPO'd at $22 on Feb 13, 2025. Stock surged immediately, reaching ~$81 by Feb 18, 2026 — a **268% gain** in one year. The 52-week price change is +153%. Up 5-8% on Feb 18, 2026 alone, likely driven by rising Iran strike probability (Polymarket 67%).

Short interest at 5.9% of shares outstanding (7.8M shares), with 4.2 days to cover.

## Iran strike angle

Karman's most direct geopolitical catalyst is a potential US or Israeli strike on Iran's underground nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz. The company manufactures advanced penetrator warheads and thermal protection systems designed specifically for hardened, deeply buried targets. The US [[GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator]] and next-generation bunker-busting systems require exactly the kind of payload protection and warhead engineering Karman specializes in. Any escalation in Iran tensions is a direct catalyst for Karman's order book.
