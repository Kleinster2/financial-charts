## Financials

All figures in RMB millions unless noted.

### Revenue trajectory

| Year | Revenue | YoY Change | Gross Margin |
|------|---------|------------|--------------|
| 2020 | 18M | — | 74% |
| 2021 | 138M | +660% | 37% |
| 2022 | 528M | +282% | 44% |
| 2023 | 402M | -24% | 46% |
| 2024 | 361M | -10% | 31% |
| TTM (Sep 2025) | 511M | +40% | 33% |

**Revenue peaked in 2022** and declined for two years before recovering in 2025. The 2022-2024 decline reflected China's macro slowdown and transition from one-off vehicle sales to recurring service revenue.

### Q3 2025 (most recent)

| Metric | Q3 2025 | YoY Change |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Revenue | RMB 171M ($24M) | **+144%** |
| Product revenue | RMB 79M | +428% |
| Service revenue | RMB 92M | +67% |
| Robotaxi revenue | RMB 35M ($5M) | **+761%** |
| Gross profit | RMB 56M | +1,124% |
| Gross margin | 33% | vs 6.5% YoY |
| Net loss | RMB 307M ($43M) | **narrowed 71%** |
| R&D expense | RMB 316M | +24% |
| Operating expense | RMB 436M | -51% |

Robotaxi revenue was only 5.8% of total in Q3 2024 → now 21% in Q3 2025. This is the key transition: from hardware sales to recurring ride-fare revenue.

### Balance sheet

| Metric | Value (Sep 30, 2025) |
|--------|---------------------|
| Cash + time deposits | RMB 4.5B (~$635M) |
| Wealth management products | RMB 926M |
| Restricted cash | RMB 18M |
| **Total liquidity** | **~$764M** |
| Short-term borrowings | RMB 245M |
| Share repurchase authorized | $100M (not yet initiated) |

**Runway:** At current burn (~$43M/quarter net loss, declining), has 4+ years of cash runway without additional capital raises.

### Annual losses

| Year | Net Loss |
|------|----------|
| 2022 | RMB 1.3B |
| 2023 | RMB 1.9B |
| 2024 | RMB 2.5B |
| TTM | RMB 1.7B (improving) |

2024 loss spike was driven by IPO-related SBC. Underlying operational losses are narrowing significantly.

## Product portfolio

| Product | Type | Status | Key detail |
|---------|------|--------|------------|
| Robotaxi (GXR) | L4 autonomous passenger | Commercial (China, UAE) | ~750 vehicles globally |
| Robobus | L4 autonomous shuttle | Deployed (China, Belgium, France) | 1M+ passengers since 2021; 100-unit Guangzhou order |
| Robovan W5 | L4 autonomous cargo | Launched Feb 2025 | Last-mile logistics |
| Robosweeper S1 | L4 autonomous sanitation | Deployed (China, Singapore) | Partnership with CTM Singapore |
| WePilot 3.0 | L2++ ADAS system | Production started Nov 2025 | End-to-end system with [[Bosch]]; Chery EXEED ES/ET models; selected by GAC |

**Multi-product strategy** is the differentiator — WeRide is the only company deploying taxis, buses, vans, AND sweepers at L4. This diversifies revenue and creates multiple regulatory entry points per market.

## Business model: China vs international

| Dimension | China | International |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Fleet ownership | WeRide owns & operates | Partners own & operate |
| Demand | WeRide Go app | [[Uber]], Grab platforms |
| Revenue streams | Ride fares | 1) Ride-fare share 2) Annual licensing 3) Vehicle sales |
| Fleet management | WeRide | Partner/Uber |
| Capex intensity | High | Low (asset-light) |

The international model is **capital-light** — WeRide provides technology and vehicles, partners provide demand and operations. This enables faster scaling without balance sheet strain.

---

## The "Abu Dhabi Model" — path to unit economics

Abu Dhabi is WeRide's profitability template. Management stated Abu Dhabi is "approaching unit economics breakeven."

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Human-to-vehicle ratio | ~1:3 | **1:10** |
| Trips per vehicle per day | 12-20 | **25-30** |
| Service hours | 12 hrs | **24/7** |
| City coverage | ~70% of core | **Full city** |
| Operational mileage | ~1M km accumulated | Scaling |

**Unit economics logic:** UAE fares are significantly higher than China. Combined with China-cost hardware and engineering, margin structure is inherently favorable. Once human-to-vehicle ratio hits 1:10 and utilization reaches 25+ trips/day, each vehicle should be profitable.

The plan is to replicate this model → Dubai → Riyadh → Singapore (via Grab) → European cities.

## Uber partnership — Middle East expansion

| Milestone | Date | Detail |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Partnership announced | Jun 2024 | WeRide AVs on Uber platform, starting UAE |
| Abu Dhabi commercial launch | Dec 2024 | First robotaxi rides via Uber app |
| Downtown Abu Dhabi expansion | Feb 12, 2026 | Khalifa City, Masdar City, Corniche → Grand Mosque |
| Fleet quadrupled | Feb 2026 | ~70% of Abu Dhabi covered |
| 1,200 robotaxis announced | Feb 6, 2026 | Deployment across entire Middle East, completion ~2027 |
| Riyadh launch | Oct 2025 | First publicly available robotaxi in Saudi Arabia (via Uber) |
| Dubai trial permit | Sep 2025 | Safety-driver operation; full driverless expected 2026 |

**Scale plan:** 100 vehicles today → 500 by end 2026 → "tens of thousands" by 2030.

---

## Global operations

| Country | City | Status | Platform |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| **China** | Guangzhou | Full commercial, 24/7, 300+ vehicles | WeRide Go |
| | Beijing | Full commercial, 100+ vehicles | WeRide Go |
| | Shanghai | Full commercial (Jul 2025) | WeRide Go |
| | Ordos | Full commercial | WeRide Go |
| | Suzhou | Announced | — |
| **UAE** | Abu Dhabi | Fully driverless commercial | [[Uber]] |
| | Dubai | Safety-driver → driverless 2026 | [[Uber]] |
| | Ras Al Khaimah | Announced | — |
| **Saudi Arabia** | Riyadh | Safety-driver service | [[Uber]] |
| **Singapore** | Punggol District | Licensed (robotaxi + robobus) | Grab |
| **France** | Drôme | First European fully driverless robobus | Renault/beti |
| **Belgium** | Leuven | First L4 test permit | — |
| **Switzerland** | Zurich/Furttal | First driverless license; public service H1 2026 | SBB |
| **Hong Kong** | — | 500 L4 vehicles over 3 years | Kwoon Chung Bus |

**China utilization data (Nov 2025):** Guangzhou robotaxis averaging 25 daily trips; Beijing 23 daily trips. These are strong numbers — comparable to human rideshare drivers.

---

## L2++ ADAS strategy — the "double flywheel"

WeRide is no longer just an L4 company. WePilot 3.0 (with [[Bosch]]) is an end-to-end L2++ system comparable to Tesla FSD.

**The flywheel:**
- Mass-market L2+ vehicles produce broad driving data → improves L4 world models
- L4 robotaxis produce high-fidelity edge-case data → improves L2+ safety
- Shared "WeRide One" platform and "WeRide Genesis" world model underpin both

**OEM partnerships:**
- **Chery EXEED** — WePilot 3.0 production started Nov 2025 (ES/ET models, OTA to existing owners)
- **GAC (Guangzhou Auto)** — Selected as major ADAS provider for multiple models

This creates a revenue stream from ADAS licensing independent of robotaxi deployment.

## Stock performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IPO price (Oct 2024) | $15.50/ADS |
| Current (Feb 13, 2026) | $7.57 |
| Since IPO | **-51%** |
| HK listing (Nov 2025) | Opened down ~8% on debut |
| 52-week range | ~$2.96 - $15.50 |

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Market cap | Robotaxis | Geography | Key difference |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| [[Waymo]] (Alphabet) | Part of $2T+ | ~2,500 | US only | Deepest single-market penetration |
| [[Baidu]] Apollo | Part of $30B | Largest China fleet | China mainly | Most robotaxis in China |
| Pony.ai (PONY) | ~$5B | ~250 | China, some intl | Higher rev ($25M Q3) but narrower geography |
| WeRide (WRD) | ~$2.6B | ~750 | **11 countries** | Broadest international footprint |
| Cruise (GM) | Restructuring | Paused | — | Effectively out of race |
| [[Tesla]] | $1T+ | Pre-launch | US planned | Vision-only FSD approach, massive scale potential |

**WeRide vs Pony.ai** (the key comp):
- WeRide: broader geography (11 vs ~4 countries), multi-product (taxi+bus+van+sweeper), Uber/Grab partnerships, L2++ ADAS with Bosch
- Pony.ai: higher revenue, deeper in China Tier-1 cities, robotruck business, Toyota partnership
- Pony.ai is "furthest from profitability among the three major Chinese robotaxi operators" (CNBC)

## Risks

**Structural:**
- VIE (Variable Interest Entity) structure — standard for Chinese companies listed in US but creates legal uncertainty
- US-China geopolitical risk (delisting threat, export controls on AV technology)
- $2.5B in cumulative losses; still pre-profitability at company level
- Revenue declined for 2 years (2023-2024) before recovering

**Operational:**
- ~750 robotaxis vs Waymo's 2,500 — smaller fleet in any single market
- Each new country requires separate regulatory approval and localization
- Hardware deployment is capital-intensive even in asset-light model
- Competition from deep-pocketed [[Waymo]], [[Baidu]], [[Tesla]]

**Financial:**
- Stock down 51% from IPO — investor patience being tested
- $100M buyback authorized but not yet initiated (pending HK listing shareholder approval)
- P/S ratio ~30x on ~$70M annualized revenue — priced for growth that must materialize

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Abu Dhabi approaching unit economics breakeven — first proof of profitable robotaxi operations
- Broadest international footprint of any AV company (8 countries, 11 with fleet ops)
- Asset-light international model (Uber/Grab provide demand, WeRide provides tech)
- L2++ ADAS with Bosch opens mass-market OEM revenue stream
- $764M cash = 4+ year runway; losses narrowing 71% YoY
- Stock at -51% from IPO may price in much of the risk
- 1,200 Middle East robotaxis by ~2027 could transform revenue trajectory

**Bear:**
- Still only ~$70M annualized revenue against $2.6B market cap
- Chinese company VIE risks in hostile US-China environment
- Revenue declined 2023-2024 before recovering — execution not guaranteed
- Waymo and Tesla have far more resources
- Robotaxi economics unproven at scale anywhere in the world
- Share dilution risk from continued losses
