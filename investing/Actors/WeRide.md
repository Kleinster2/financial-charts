- Uber partnership provides demand without marketing cost

- L4 autonomous driving permits in 5 countries

**Bear:**
- ~$3B market cap but still pre-scale revenue
- Chinese company risks (VIE structure, geopolitics, delisting threat)
- Capital-intensive hardware deployment
- Competition from Waymo, Baidu, Tesla with deeper pockets
- Regulatory uncertainty in each new market
