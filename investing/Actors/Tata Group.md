## AI strategy

### OpenAI–Tata strategic partnership (Feb 2026)

Announced at the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]]:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Data centers** | TCS building AI-ready data centers under [[OpenAI]]'s global Stargate initiative |
| **Initial capacity** | 100 MW |
| **Scalable to** | 1 GW |
| **Focus** | Data residency, security, domestic AI capability |
| **Enterprise deployment** | ChatGPT Enterprise rollout across Tata Group — starting with hundreds of thousands of employees |
| **Significance** | OpenAI's first customer for TCS data center business |

Chandrasekaran: *"We are pleased to partner with OpenAI to create state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India."*

### AI chips

Chandrasekaran revealed at the summit (Day 4, Feb 19) that Tata is working on **industry-specific AI chips** — from data centers to semiconductors to vertical AI solutions. *"Work has already started"* — no timeline given. This builds on [[Tata Electronics]]' existing semiconductor fab investments (a $10B+ fab in Gujarat with [[PSMC]] partnership).

### TCS and AI disruption

TCS is the world's second-largest IT services company by market cap, but faces existential questions from AI-driven [[AI disintermediation]] of traditional IT outsourcing. TCS CEO K Krithivasan at the summit: *"You can't have an LLM in one day and expect software engineers to go away"* — roles evolving toward "context engineering."

TCS market cap fell ~29% in the year to Feb 2026, partly on AI disruption fears.

## Structure

Unique among Indian conglomerates: **Tata Trusts** (charitable foundations) own ~66% of Tata Sons (the holding company). This means the majority of Tata Group profits flow to philanthropy — one of the world's largest such structures. Ratan Tata (1937–2024) shaped the modern group; Chandrasekaran took the chair in 2017.
