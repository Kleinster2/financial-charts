## Investment relevance

2. **Mature [[SaaS]] case study** — Shows what happens when growth ends — margin expansion.

3. **AI pivot attempt** — Dropbox Dash is AI play to reignite growth.

4. **YC flagship** — Among most successful YC companies, validates accelerator model.

5. **Buyback machine** — Using cash flow for aggressive buybacks.

**Concerns:**
- Paying users declining
- Competition from [[Microsoft]] OneDrive, [[Google]] Drive
- [[Consumer]] perception as commodity
