## Why Blue Owl matters

Blue Owl is becoming the bank for AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $273B (Mar 2025) |
| Digital infrastructure capital | $34B |
| Facilities | 90+ across 25+ markets |
| Largest deal | Meta **$30B SPV** (largest private credit deal ever) |

---

## Portfolio composition (OBDC platform, Q3 2025)

Blue Owl's BDCs share the same lending platform — OBDC, OBDC II, and OTIC hold overlapping positions in the same borrowers. The $1.4B loan sale cut across 128 companies in 27 industries. Largest sector: **internet software & services at 13%**.

### Top software/tech positions (OBDC, fair value $M)

| Holding entity | Known as | $M | AI disruption risk |
|---------------|----------|-----|-------------------|
| Litera Bidco | **Litera** (legal tech) | 161 | Medium — workflow automation |
| Crewline Buyer | **New Relic** (observability) | 147 | High — AI-native monitoring emerging |
| Cornerstone OnDemand | **Cornerstone** (HR/learning) | 144 | High — AI agents replacing LMS |
| Bayshore Intermediate | **Boomi** (iPaaS) | 91+ | Medium — integration layer |
| Delinea Buyer | **Delinea** (PAM security) | 88 | Low — security sticky |
| Denali Intermediate | **Dun & Bradstreet** (data) | 76 | Medium — data moats defensible |
| CivicPlus | **CivicPlus** (gov tech) | 80+ | Low — government sticky |
| QAD Inc. | **QAD** (mfg ERP) | 72 | Medium — ERP has switching costs |
| BCTO BSI Buyer | **Buildertrend** (construction) | 71 | Medium — vertical SaaS |
| Hyland Software | **Hyland** (content mgmt) | 66 | High — document AI replacing ECM |
| Anaplan | **Anaplan** (planning) | 64 | High — AI planning tools emerging |
| MINDBODY | **Mindbody** (fitness SaaS) | 62 | Medium — SMB vertical |
| H&F Opportunities | **Checkmarx** (AppSec) | 51 | Low — security sticky |
| Einstein Parent | **Smartsheet** (work mgmt) | 43 | High — AI project tools emerging |
| By Light Professional | **By Light** (defense IT) | 41 | Low — government/defense |
| Azurite Intermediate | **Alteryx** (analytics) | 16 | High — AI replacing drag-and-drop analytics |
| Barracuda Parent | **Barracuda** (security) | 10 | Low — security sticky |

**Pattern:** These are overwhelmingly **PE-backed SaaS buyouts** — companies taken private at high valuations with leveraged debt, now carrying significant floating-rate obligations while facing AI disruption to their core products. The highest-risk names (New Relic, Cornerstone, Hyland, Anaplan, Smartsheet, Alteryx) are exactly the categories where AI agents are creating alternatives.

### Top non-software positions (OBDC, fair value $M)

| Company | Industry | $M |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Associations Inc. | Buildings/real estate | 446 |
| Fifth Season Investments | Insurance | 403 |
| Blue Owl Credit SLF | Joint ventures | 415 |
| Rocket BidCo (Recochem) | Chemicals | 260 |
| Minotaur Acq. (Inspira Financial) | Financial services | 256 |
| Metis HoldCo (Mavis Tire) | Automotive services | 252 |
| LSI Financing (pharma) | Pharmaceuticals | 211 |
| Aerosmith Bidco (Audiotonix) | Leisure/entertainment | 209 |
| Gaylord Chemical | Chemicals | 184 |
| HGH Purchaser (Horizon Services) | Household products | 180 |
| OB Hospitalist Group | Healthcare | 165 |
| Intelerad Medical Systems | Healthcare tech | 169 |
| Galls LLC | Specialty retail | 163 |
| Gerson Lehrman Group | Professional services | 156 |
| Monotype Imaging | Advertising/media | 152 |
| Inovalon Holdings | Healthcare tech | 150+ |
| Faraday Buyer (MacLean Power) | Manufacturing | 149 |
| Patriot Acq. (Corza Health) | Healthcare equipment | 158 |

**Diversification reality:** The portfolio is genuinely diversified across healthcare, insurance, chemicals, manufacturing, food & beverage, and business services. Software at 13% is the largest single sector but not dominant. The risk is that software names are the ones most likely to deteriorate simultaneously under AI pressure — correlated defaults in an otherwise diversified book.

## Major [[AI infrastructure deals]]

| Deal | Size | Partner | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **Meta** | **$30B SPV** | [[Meta]] | Closed Oct 2025 — largest private credit deal ever |
| **Crusoe Abilene** | $15B | Crusoe Energy | 1.2GW, "largest GPU cluster in world" |
| **Oracle Michigan** | ~$10B | [[Oracle]] | Pulled out — Oracle debt concerns |

---

## Meta deal ($30B SPV + $30B bonds = $60B total)

**Oct 2025:** Meta raised $60B for data centers in a single month:

| Tranche | Size | Structure | Lead |
|---------|------|-----------|------|
| **Off-balance-sheet** | $30B | SPV | [[Morgan Stanley]] → Blue Owl |
| **On-balance-sheet** | $30B | Corporate bonds | Largest IG offering of 2025 |

**SPV structure:**
- [[Morgan Stanley]] structured the deal
- Debt sits in SPV tied to Blue Owl
- Blue Owl: 80% ownership
- Meta: 20% ownership
- Location: Richland Parish, Louisiana (Hyperion)

**Why it matters:**
- **Largest private capital transaction on record**
- Template for hyperscaler **off-balance-sheet financing**
- Blue Owl takes construction/financing risk
- Meta gets capacity without balance sheet hit
- Hyperscalers increasingly prefer leasing to owning (Nadella: "excited to be a leaser")
- Made it easier for Meta to also raise $30B in traditional bonds

---

## Crusoe Abilene deal

**Phase 1 (Oct 2024):** $3.4B JV
**Phase 2 (May 2025):** $15B expansion

**Details:**
- 1.2 GW data center
- Abilene, Texas
- "One of largest GPU clusters in the world"
- Crusoe operates, Blue Owl finances
- $2.3B construction financing via JPMorgan

---

## Digital Infrastructure Fund III

- Final close: May 2025
- Size: $7B (exceeded $4B target)
- Focus: AI and cloud data centers
- Strategy: Develop, acquire, own facilities

**Additional:** $1.7B raised Dec 2025 for Blue Owl Digital Infrastructure Trust (non-traded REIT)

---

## GPU financing thesis

**Blue Owl's view:**
- 75% of AI cloud spend → GPU purchases
- GPUs retain value for years
- Makes attractive collateral for lending
- $300B+ data center spend in 2025 alone

**The model:** Finance GPU purchases and data centers, secured by hardware value.

---

## Oracle deal — why it fell apart

Blue Owl pulled out of ~$10B Oracle Michigan data center:
- Concerns over Oracle's rising debt
- Oracle's aggressive AI spending
- Stock dropped 5% on news
- Shows discipline — Blue Owl won't finance anything

---

## OBDC II redemption crisis (Feb 2026)

**Feb 18-19, 2026:** Blue Owl sold **$1.4B in loans** from three BDC funds to four buyers at 99.7% of par. OWL shares **-8.7%** on the news.

**Buyers (Bloomberg, Feb 20):**

| Buyer | Type |
|-------|------|
| [[CalPERS]] | US public pension ($500B+) |
| [[OMERS]] | Canadian public pension |
| [[British Columbia Investment Management]] | Canadian public pension |
| [[Kuvare]] | Chicago-based insurer — **owned by Blue Owl** ($750M acquisition, 2024) |

Packer on demand: bidder interest so strong "they would have bought multiple amounts more."

**Barclays CLO leverage warning (Feb 20):** Some sold assets likely end up in Blue Owl-managed [[CLO]]s purchased by Kuvare. BDCs carry ~1x leverage; CLOs carry 9-10x. Moving assets from visible BDCs into opaque, highly leveraged CLO structures "would add additional leverage to private credit assets" and deepen ties between private credit and insurance, making risk harder to track. Barclays warned this could become a **template** for future BDC → CLO transfers across the industry. See [[PE-insurance convergence]].

| Fund | Amount sold | % of portfolio | Action |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **OBDC II** | $600M | 34% of $1.7B | **Permanently halted quarterly redemptions** |
| OBDC | $400M | 2% | Normal operations |
| OTIC | $400M | 6% | Normal operations |

**OBDC II fund profile:**
- Launched **2017** as a finite-life vehicle (~10-year horizon, wind-down around 2027)
- Non-traded BDC aimed at **retail investors** with quarterly 5% NAV redemption windows
- Semi-liquid private credit fund lending to US middle-market companies
- Exactly the type of vehicle the industry has been pushing to Main Street

**What triggered the crisis (causal chain):**

1. **Credit quality deterioration** — middle-market borrower defaults climbed to **4.55%**. Downgrades outpacing upgrades for **7 consecutive quarters**. High interest rates squeezing floating-rate borrowers
2. **Software selloff** — S&P 500 Software & Services index lost **~$2 trillion** since October peak, ~half in February alone. AI disruption fears hitting valuations of the exact companies OBDC II lent to
3. **Redemption surge** — ~$150M in redemption requests in first 9 months of 2025, **up 20% YoY**. Investors questioning underlying loan quality
4. **Botched OBDC II → OBDC merger (Nov 2025)** — would have imposed **~20% losses** on OBDC II investors. Abandoned after stock sold off and backlash. Redemptions frozen during merger attempt — investors expected them to resume this quarter
5. **Liquidity mismatch** — underlying loans can't be sold quickly without losses. Honoring redemptions would benefit early redeemers at remaining investors' expense. Blue Owl chose to gate everyone equally

**The resolution:**
- **Quarterly redemptions permanently ended** — replaced by pro-rata distributions funded by asset sales, earnings, and repayments
- Investors receive up to **$2.35/share (~30% of NAV)** by end of March
- Board approved **$300M stock buyback** (replacing prior $200M authorization)
- Sold loans at **99.7% of par** — no distress pricing
- OBDC II historical performance: **80% cumulative returns, 9.3% annualized** since inception, non-accruals under 2%, realized losses only 23 bps

**Industry-wide redemption pressure:** BDCs with >$1B AUM saw **$2.9B in withdrawal requests in Q4 2025**, up **200% from Q3** (Robert A Stanger & Co.). Not just a Blue Owl problem.

**Contagion:** Alt manager stocks sold off across the board — [[Apollo]] -6%, [[Blackstone]] -6%, [[Ares Management]] -6%, [[KKR]] -4%, [[Carlyle Group]] -5%. Mohamed El-Erian: *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?"*

**Political response:** Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for increased bank capital requirements for private credit exposures, greater data disclosure from funds, and a stress test for the market.

**Bear vs bull read:**
- **Bear:** First retail BDC to permanently gate investors. If redemption pressure spreads to larger vehicles (OBDC at $16B+, or competitor retail BDCs), the $1.8T private credit market faces a liquidity event. Software concentration (13% of sold loans) validates [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] thesis
- **Bull:** Controlled wind-down of a finite-life fund approaching its natural end date. Sold at near-par (no fire sale). Strong historical returns. Pro-rata distribution treats all shareholders equally

**Q4 2025 earnings call (same day, Feb 19):**

CEO Craig Packer dismissed "halted redemptions" framing as a *"complete mischaracterization"* — said OBDC II is doing accelerated 30% pro rata capital return with continued quarterly 5% distributions. Packer on earnings call: *"We've been tendering for 5% of the shares of this fund for eight years. Instead of resuming 5% a quarter, we are in fact accelerating redemptions."* Sold $1.4B at near-par across three vehicles to North American public pension funds and insurance companies. Barclays called it *"a strong step toward winding down the fund."* Key portfolio metrics undercut the crisis narrative:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Non-accruals (fair value) | **1.1%** | Down from 1.3% (Q3), below public market defaults |
| Software borrower revenue growth (LTM) | **+10%** | Performing |
| Software borrower EBITDA growth (LTM) | **+16%** | Performing |
| Software as first-lien senior secured | **90%** | LTVs ~30% |
| Total portfolio revenue growth | **+8% YoY** | Positive every sub-sector |
| Total portfolio EBITDA growth | **+11% YoY** | Accelerating vs 2024 |
| PIK as % of investment income | **10.3%** | Down from 13.2% a year ago |
| Interest coverage | **~2x** | Healthy |
| NAV/share | **$14.81** | Down $0.08 (write-downs on "watch list names") |
| Adj NII/share | **$0.36** | Flat sequentially |

Software is only **4 of top 25 investments**. Concentration will remain capped or decline — management affirmed "discriminating approach" given AI risks. No specific borrower defaults named publicly. Loan sale at 99.7% par with four unaffiliated buyers under standard LSTA procedures — Packer: *"There is nothing behind the scenes that would in any way undermine that conclusion."*

**Moody's upgraded OBDC to Baa2** in January 2026 — one of few BDCs earning this rating.

**The uncomfortable truth:** The gate happened at non-accruals of just 1.1%. This is a liquidity/structure problem, not a credit blowup — *yet*. The market is pricing in forward-looking AI disruption risk before defaults materialize. If non-accruals actually spike to 4-5% (Deutsche Bank's aggressive scenario), the damage would be far worse.

**Saba/Cox tender offers (Feb 20):** [[Saba Capital]] and [[Cox Capital Partners]] announced intention to launch cash tender offers for OBDC II, OTIC, and OCIC shares at **20-35% discount to NAV**. Extends Saba's closed-end fund activism playbook to non-traded BDCs. OWL +2.2% after-hours. See [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]].
