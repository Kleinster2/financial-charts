## Why Blue Owl matters

Blue Owl is becoming the bank for AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $273B (Mar 2025) |
| Digital infrastructure capital | $34B |
| Facilities | 90+ across 25+ markets |
| Largest deal | Meta **$30B SPV** (largest private credit deal ever) |

---

## Major [[AI infrastructure deals]]

| Deal | Size | Partner | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **Meta** | **$30B SPV** | [[Meta]] | Closed Oct 2025 — largest private credit deal ever |
| **Crusoe Abilene** | $15B | Crusoe Energy | 1.2GW, "largest GPU cluster in world" |
| **Oracle Michigan** | ~$10B | [[Oracle]] | Pulled out — Oracle debt concerns |

---

## Meta deal ($30B SPV + $30B bonds = $60B total)

**Oct 2025:** Meta raised $60B for data centers in a single month:

| Tranche | Size | Structure | Lead |
|---------|------|-----------|------|
| **Off-balance-sheet** | $30B | SPV | [[Morgan Stanley]] → Blue Owl |
| **On-balance-sheet** | $30B | Corporate bonds | Largest IG offering of 2025 |

**SPV structure:**
- [[Morgan Stanley]] structured the deal
- Debt sits in SPV tied to Blue Owl
- Blue Owl: 80% ownership
- Meta: 20% ownership
- Location: Richland Parish, Louisiana (Hyperion)

**Why it matters:**
- **Largest private capital transaction on record**
- Template for hyperscaler **off-balance-sheet financing**
- Blue Owl takes construction/financing risk
- Meta gets capacity without balance sheet hit
- Hyperscalers increasingly prefer leasing to owning (Nadella: "excited to be a leaser")
- Made it easier for Meta to also raise $30B in traditional bonds

---

## Crusoe Abilene deal

**Phase 1 (Oct 2024):** $3.4B JV
**Phase 2 (May 2025):** $15B expansion

**Details:**
- 1.2 GW data center
- Abilene, Texas
- "One of largest GPU clusters in the world"
- Crusoe operates, Blue Owl finances
- $2.3B construction financing via JPMorgan

---

## Digital Infrastructure Fund III

- Final close: May 2025
- Size: $7B (exceeded $4B target)
- Focus: AI and cloud data centers
- Strategy: Develop, acquire, own facilities

**Additional:** $1.7B raised Dec 2025 for Blue Owl Digital Infrastructure Trust (non-traded REIT)

---

## GPU financing thesis

**Blue Owl's view:**
- 75% of AI cloud spend → GPU purchases
- GPUs retain value for years
- Makes attractive collateral for lending
- $300B+ data center spend in 2025 alone

**The model:** Finance GPU purchases and data centers, secured by hardware value.

---

## Oracle deal — why it fell apart

Blue Owl pulled out of ~$10B Oracle Michigan data center:
- Concerns over Oracle's rising debt
- Oracle's aggressive AI spending
- Stock dropped 5% on news
- Shows discipline — Blue Owl won't finance anything

## OBDC II redemption crisis (Feb 2026)

**Feb 18-19, 2026:** Blue Owl sold **$1.4B in loans** from three BDC funds to four North American pension and insurance investors at 99.7% of par. OWL shares **-8.7%** on the news.

| Fund | Amount sold | % of portfolio | Action |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **OBDC II** | $600M | 34% of $1.7B | **Permanently halted quarterly redemptions** |
| OBDC | $400M | 2% | Normal operations |
| OTIC | $400M | 6% | Normal operations |

**OBDC II fund profile:**
- Launched **2017** as a finite-life vehicle (~10-year horizon, wind-down around 2027)
- Non-traded BDC aimed at **retail investors** with quarterly 5% NAV redemption windows
- Semi-liquid private credit fund lending to US middle-market companies
- Exactly the type of vehicle the industry has been pushing to Main Street

**What triggered the crisis (causal chain):**

1. **Credit quality deterioration** — middle-market borrower defaults climbed to **4.55%**. Downgrades outpacing upgrades for **7 consecutive quarters**. High interest rates squeezing floating-rate borrowers
2. **Software selloff** — S&P 500 Software & Services index lost **~$2 trillion** since October peak, ~half in February alone. AI disruption fears hitting valuations of the exact companies OBDC II lent to
3. **Redemption surge** — ~$150M in redemption requests in first 9 months of 2025, **up 20% YoY**. Investors questioning underlying loan quality
4. **Botched OBDC II → OBDC merger (Nov 2025)** — would have imposed **~20% losses** on OBDC II investors. Abandoned after stock sold off and backlash. Redemptions frozen during merger attempt — investors expected them to resume this quarter
5. **Liquidity mismatch** — underlying loans can't be sold quickly without losses. Honoring redemptions would benefit early redeemers at remaining investors' expense. Blue Owl chose to gate everyone equally

**The resolution:**
- **Quarterly redemptions permanently ended** — replaced by pro-rata distributions funded by asset sales, earnings, and repayments
- Investors receive up to **$2.35/share (~30% of NAV)** by end of March
- Board approved **$300M stock buyback** (replacing prior $200M authorization)
- Sold loans at **99.7% of par** — no distress pricing
- OBDC II historical performance: **80% cumulative returns, 9.3% annualized** since inception, non-accruals under 2%, realized losses only 23 bps

**Industry-wide redemption pressure:** BDCs with >$1B AUM saw **$2.9B in withdrawal requests in Q4 2025**, up **200% from Q3** (Robert A Stanger & Co.). Not just a Blue Owl problem.

**Contagion:** Alt manager stocks sold off across the board — [[Apollo]] -6%, [[Blackstone]] -6%, [[Ares Management]] -6%, [[KKR]] -4%, [[Carlyle Group]] -5%. Mohamed El-Erian: *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?"*

**Political response:** Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for increased bank capital requirements for private credit exposures, greater data disclosure from funds, and a stress test for the market.

**Bear vs bull read:**
- **Bear:** First retail BDC to permanently gate investors. If redemption pressure spreads to larger vehicles (OBDC at $16B+, or competitor retail BDCs), the $1.8T private credit market faces a liquidity event. Software concentration (13% of sold loans) validates [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] thesis
- **Bull:** Controlled wind-down of a finite-life fund approaching its natural end date. Sold at near-par (no fire sale). Strong historical returns. Pro-rata distribution treats all shareholders equally

**Q4 2025 earnings call (same day, Feb 19):**

CEO Craig Packer dismissed "halted redemptions" framing as a *"complete mischaracterization"* — said OBDC II is doing accelerated 30% pro rata capital return with continued quarterly 5% distributions. Packer on earnings call: *"We've been tendering for 5% of the shares of this fund for eight years. Instead of resuming 5% a quarter, we are in fact accelerating redemptions."* Sold $1.4B at near-par across three vehicles to North American public pension funds and insurance companies. Barclays called it *"a strong step toward winding down the fund."* Key portfolio metrics undercut the crisis narrative:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Non-accruals (fair value) | **1.1%** | Down from 1.3% (Q3), below public market defaults |
| Software borrower revenue growth (LTM) | **+10%** | Performing |
| Software borrower EBITDA growth (LTM) | **+16%** | Performing |
| Software as first-lien senior secured | **90%** | LTVs ~30% |
| Total portfolio revenue growth | **+8% YoY** | Positive every sub-sector |
| Total portfolio EBITDA growth | **+11% YoY** | Accelerating vs 2024 |
| PIK as % of investment income | **10.3%** | Down from 13.2% a year ago |
| Interest coverage | **~2x** | Healthy |
| NAV/share | **$14.81** | Down $0.08 (write-downs on "watch list names") |
| Adj NII/share | **$0.36** | Flat sequentially |

Software is only **4 of top 25 investments**. Concentration will remain capped or decline — management affirmed "discriminating approach" given AI risks. No specific borrower defaults named publicly. Loan sale at 99.7% par with four unaffiliated buyers under standard LSTA procedures — Packer: *"There is nothing behind the scenes that would in any way undermine that conclusion."*

**Moody's upgraded OBDC to Baa2** in January 2026 — one of few BDCs earning this rating.

**The uncomfortable truth:** The gate happened at non-accruals of just 1.1%. This is a liquidity/structure problem, not a credit blowup — *yet*. The market is pricing in forward-looking AI disruption risk before defaults materialize. If non-accruals actually spike to 4-5% (Deutsche Bank's aggressive scenario), the damage would be far worse.
