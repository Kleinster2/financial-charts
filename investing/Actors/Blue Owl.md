## Why Blue Owl matters

Blue Owl is becoming the bank for AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $273B (Mar 2025) |
| Digital infrastructure capital | $34B |
| Facilities | 90+ across 25+ markets |
| Largest deal | Meta **$30B SPV** (largest private credit deal ever) |

---

## Major AI infrastructure deals

| Deal | Size | Partner | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **Meta** | **$30B SPV** | [[Meta]] | Closed Oct 2025 — largest private credit deal ever |
| **Crusoe Abilene** | $15B | Crusoe Energy | 1.2GW, "largest GPU cluster in world" |
| **Oracle Michigan** | ~$10B | [[Oracle]] | Pulled out — Oracle debt concerns |

---

## Meta deal ($30B SPV + $30B bonds = $60B total)

**Oct 2025:** Meta raised $60B for data centers in a single month:

| Tranche | Size | Structure | Lead |
|---------|------|-----------|------|
| **Off-balance-sheet** | $30B | SPV | Morgan Stanley → Blue Owl |
| **On-balance-sheet** | $30B | Corporate bonds | Largest IG offering of 2025 |

**SPV structure:**
- Morgan Stanley structured the deal
- Debt sits in SPV tied to Blue Owl
- Blue Owl: 80% ownership
- Meta: 20% ownership
- Location: Richland Parish, Louisiana (Hyperion)

**Why it matters:**
- **Largest private capital transaction on record**
- Template for hyperscaler **off-balance-sheet financing**
- Blue Owl takes construction/financing risk
- Meta gets capacity without balance sheet hit
- Hyperscalers increasingly prefer leasing to owning (Nadella: "excited to be a leaser")
- Made it easier for Meta to also raise $30B in traditional bonds

## Crusoe Abilene deal

**Phase 1 (Oct 2024):** $3.4B JV
**Phase 2 (May 2025):** $15B expansion

**Details:**
- 1.2 GW data center
- Abilene, Texas
- "One of largest GPU clusters in the world"
- Crusoe operates, Blue Owl finances
- $2.3B construction financing via JPMorgan

---

## Digital Infrastructure Fund III

- Final close: May 2025
- Size: $7B (exceeded $4B target)
- Focus: AI and cloud data centers
- Strategy: Develop, acquire, own facilities

**Additional:** $1.7B raised Dec 2025 for Blue Owl Digital Infrastructure Trust (non-traded REIT)

---

## GPU financing thesis

**Blue Owl's view:**
- 75% of AI cloud spend → GPU purchases
- GPUs retain value for years
- Makes attractive collateral for lending
- $300B+ data center spend in 2025 alone

**The model:** Finance GPU purchases and data centers, secured by hardware value.

---

## Oracle deal — why it fell apart

Blue Owl pulled out of ~$10B Oracle Michigan data center:
- Concerns over Oracle's rising debt
- Oracle's aggressive AI spending
- Stock dropped 5% on news
- Shows discipline — Blue Owl won't finance anything

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Essential infrastructure financing
- Hyperscalers need off-balance-sheet solutions
- GPU collateral is tangible
- Recurring management fees
- Public stock (OWL)

**Bear:**
- Interest rate sensitivity
- AI capex cycle could slow
- Concentration in data centers
- Competition from other PE firms

---

## Competitors

| Firm | Data center exposure |
|------|---------------------|
| **Blackstone** | QTS, major DC portfolio |
| **KKR** | Various infrastructure |
| **Brookfield** | Infrastructure focus |
| **DigitalBridge** | Pure-play digital infra |
| **Apollo** | Growing DC exposure |

Blue Owl is differentiated by scale of AI-specific deals.
