## Use Case

Cash benchmark. BIL's return = the risk-free rate. In the dashboard yield curve (BIL → [[SHY]] → [[IEI]] → [[IEF]] → [[TLT]]), BIL anchors the short end. When BIL outperforms [[TLT]], the curve is inverting — historically a recession signal.

## Related

- [[SHY]] — 1-3 year Treasury (next step up in duration)
- [[TLT]] — 20+ year Treasury (long end)
- [[Federal Reserve]] — sets the short rate that BIL tracks
- [[State Street]] — issuer
