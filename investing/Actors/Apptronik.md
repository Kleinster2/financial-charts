**Apptronik** — Austin-based humanoid robot startup. UT Austin spinout (2016). Building Apollo, a general-purpose bipedal humanoid for warehouse and manufacturing. [[Google DeepMind]] AI partnership ([[Gemini]] Robotics). $935M Series A at $5.3B valuation — third most-funded humanoid company after [[Figure AI]] and [[Tesla]].

## Apollo

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Height | 5'8" (1.7m) |
| Weight | 160 lbs (73 kg) |
| Payload | 55 lbs (25 kg) |
| Battery | 4 hours per pack, hot-swappable (<5 min swap) |
| Mobility | Bipedal; modular — can mount to any mobility platform |
| Control | Force control (not position control) — adapts to contact |
| Sensors | Stereoscopic cameras (eyes), E Ink display (mouth), OLED chest display |

Design philosophy: force control over position control. Apollo senses and adapts to contact rather than following rigid trajectories — safer for human collaboration, more robust in unstructured environments. Modular design allows mounting to stationary platforms, wheels, or legs depending on application.

New Apollo model set to debut in 2026.

## Google DeepMind partnership

[[Google DeepMind]] strategic partnership — the most significant AI-robotics coupling outside of [[Figure AI]]/[[OpenAI]]:

- Apollo powered by [[Gemini]] 3 and [[Gemini]] Robotics AI
- Can perform diverse real-world tasks without retraining for each environment
- Watches demonstrations, follows natural-language instructions, plans multi-step actions, handles unfamiliar objects
- [[Gemini]] Robotics built for "multi-embodiment" control — operates everything from dual-arm industrial robots to full humanoids
- Also working with [[NVIDIA]] on Omniverse digital twins for simulation and training

[[Google]] is both AI partner and lead investor — deep alignment between AI development and hardware deployment.

## Deployments

Apollo robots are operating in designated zones at partner facilities:

| Partner | Sector | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| [[Mercedes-Benz]] | Automotive manufacturing | Factory pilots (since Mar 2025) |
| [[GXO Logistics]] | Warehouse/logistics | Pilot testing |
| [[Jabil]] | Contract manufacturing | Manufacturing partner + deployment |

[[Jabil]] partnership is dual-purpose: Jabil both manufactures Apollo units and deploys them in its own facilities. Positions Apptronik for scale production without building its own factory (unlike [[Agility Robotics]]' RoboFab or [[Boston Dynamics]]' planned Robotics Innovation Hub).

## Cap table / Investors

| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation | Key investors |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Series A | Feb 2025 | $415M | $1.8B | [[Google]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[B Capital]] |
| Series A extension | Feb 2026 | $520M | $5.3B | [[Google]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[B Capital]], AT&T Ventures, [[John Deere]], [[Qatar Investment Authority]] |
| Total | | $935M | | |

Valuation nearly tripled in one year ($1.8B → $5.3B). Capital earmarked for: ramping manufacturing, expanding commercial deployments, robot training and data facilities, advancing [[Google DeepMind]] partnership, and developing next-generation humanoid (2026 debut).

[[John Deere]] and AT&T Ventures joining the extension signals industrial and telecom interest in humanoid deployment beyond traditional automotive/logistics.

## Competition

| Company | Robot | Mobility | AI partner | Funding |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| Apptronik | Apollo | Bipedal | [[Google DeepMind]] | $935M |
| [[Figure AI]] | Figure 02/03 | Bipedal | [[OpenAI]] | $2.3B+ |
| [[Boston Dynamics]] | Atlas | Bipedal | [[Google DeepMind]] | [[Hyundai]] subsidiary |
| [[Tesla Optimus]] | Optimus | Bipedal | Internal | Tesla subsidiary |
| [[Agility Robotics]] | Digit | Bipedal | — | $640M |
| [[1X Technologies]] | NEO | Bipedal | [[OpenAI]] | $125M+ |
| [[Reflex Robotics]] | Wheeled humanoid | Wheels | — | $7M |

Apptronik shares [[Google DeepMind]] as AI partner with [[Boston Dynamics]] — both get [[Gemini]] Robotics, but Apptronik is independent (not a subsidiary), giving it more flexibility on partnerships and go-to-market.

## Investment case

Bull:
- [[Google DeepMind]] AI partnership — [[Gemini]] Robotics is arguably the strongest embodied AI platform
- [[Google]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[John Deere]], [[Qatar Investment Authority]] — blue-chip investor syndicate with deployment pathways
- [[Jabil]] manufacturing partnership avoids capex of building own factory
- Force-control design philosophy differentiates from position-control competitors
- $5.3B valuation still below [[Figure AI]] ($39B) despite comparable commercial traction

Bear:
- No public revenue figures or unit counts
- [[Google DeepMind]] also partners with [[Boston Dynamics]] — not exclusive
- $935M raised but no evidence of significant commercial deployments yet (pilots only)
- [[Figure AI]] has proven 11-month BMW deployment; Apptronik's Mercedes pilot details are sparse
- New robot debuting 2026 — current Apollo may not be the production platform
