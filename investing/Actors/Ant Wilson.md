**Finally clicked:** [[Paul Copplestone]] pitched Supabase idea — Firebase-like features on top of Postgres. Wilson joined January 2020.

## Why Supabase worked

**Solved their own problem:** Copplestone hit Firebase scaling limits, wanted Postgres. They built Firebase-like features (auth, realtime, storage) on top of Postgres.

**Technical foundation:** Wilson's distributed systems background enabled real-time Postgres replication at scale.
