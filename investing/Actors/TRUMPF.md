## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Ditzingen, Germany |
| Revenue | €5.2B (FY 2023/24) |
| EUV division | €724M (FY 2024/25, down 23%) |
| Employees | ~18,000 |
| Ownership | Leibinger family (private) |
| EUV laser share | **100%** |

## Why they matter

**Only supplier of 30kW CO2 lasers for EUV light generation.**

How it works:
1. TRUMPF laser fires at tin droplets 50,000 times/second
2. Tin evaporates into plasma at 500,000K
3. Plasma emits 13.5nm EUV light
4. Light collected by [[Carl Zeiss SMT]] mirrors

No alternative laser technology exists for commercial EUV.

## Business segments

| Segment | Revenue | Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **EUV** | €724M | Lasers for ASML |
| **Laser Technology** | €1.4B | Industrial lasers |
| **Machine Tools** | ~€3B | Cutting, bending, welding |

EUV is ~14% of revenue but strategically critical.

## EUV performance

| Year | EUV Revenue | Change |
|------|-------------|--------|
| FY 2022/23 | €971M | — |
| FY 2023/24 | €943M | -2.9% |
| FY 2024/25 | €724M | **-23%** |

Decline reflects customer investment timing, not loss of position.

## Next-gen laser development

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| New high-energy laser first light | October 2025 |
| ASML supplier award | October 2025 |
| Series production begins | 2026 |

Required for [[High-NA EUV]] systems with higher power requirements.

## Technical specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Laser type | CO2 |
| Power | 30kW |
| Pulse rate | 50,000/second |
| Wavelength | 10.6μm (IR) |
| Output | 13.5nm EUV (via tin plasma) |

---

## ASML relationship

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Customer | ASML (sole EUV customer) |
| Integration | Deep technical collaboration |
| Alternatives | None |
| Dependency | Mutual — TRUMPF needs ASML, ASML needs TRUMPF |

Unlike Carl Zeiss, ASML does not hold equity stake in TRUMPF.

---

## Other business

Beyond EUV, TRUMPF is major industrial equipment player:

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Fiber lasers | Metal cutting |
| Disk lasers | Welding |
| Bending machines | Sheet metal |
| Punching machines | Manufacturing |

EUV is high-margin, high-visibility segment but not majority of business.

---

## Geopolitical significance

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| German location | EU/US export control jurisdiction |
| Single source | Global EUV depends on one supplier |
| China | Cannot supply EUV lasers to China |

Part of Western European EUV supply chain chokepoint (with ASML, Zeiss).
