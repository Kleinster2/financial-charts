## Key sectors

### [[Luxury]] (global dominance)

| Company | Market cap | Brands |
|---------|------------|--------|
| [[LVMH]] | ~$350B | Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët, Hennessy |
| [[Hermès]] | ~$250B | Birkin, Kelly, scarves |
| [[Kering]] | ~$40B | Gucci, YSL, Balenciaga |
| [[L'Oréal]] | ~$220B | Cosmetics leader |

**France = global luxury capital.** LVMH's Bernard Arnault often world's richest person.

### [[Defense]] / [[Aerospace]]

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Dassault Aviation]] | Rafale jets, Falcon bizjets |
| [[Thales]] | [[Defense]] electronics, satellites |
| Safran | Jet engines ([[CFM]] with GE) |
| Naval Group | Submarines, frigates |
| MBDA | Missiles (JV) |

**Strategic autonomy:** France maintains independent nuclear deterrent, arms industry.

### Nuclear

| Company | Role |
|---------|------|
| [[EDF]] | Operator (state-owned) |
| Framatome | Reactors (EDF subsidiary) |
| Orano | Fuel cycle |

**70%+ nuclear electricity** — lowest carbon grid in Europe. Building new EPR reactors.

### [[Semiconductors]]

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[STMicro]] | Analog, auto, industrial (HQ: Geneva, fabs in France) |
| Soitec | SOI wafers |
| Crolles fab | STMicro + [[GlobalFoundries]] |

## "Buy European" agenda

Macron pushes **"buy European"** — procurement preference for European defense and industrial goods, paired with joint EU borrowing for defense. [[Germany]] prefers **"made with Europe"** (supply chain integration) as less protectionist.

**EV subsidy design:** France doesn't directly mandate "buy European" — instead uses carbon lifecycle standards. Chinese EVs produced with coal-based electricity don't qualify. French production, powered by nuclear, does. Clever regulatory protectionism.

**Nuclear deterrence question:** As [[Germany]] emerges as Europe's dominant conventional military power ($189B budget by 2029), whether France would extend its nuclear umbrella to cover Europe — and on what terms — becomes a live question.

## Franco-German friction (Feb 2026)

Three sources of German frustration with France:

| Issue | French position | German frustration |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [[EU-Mercosur agreement]] | French bloc in EU Parliament | Obstructing finalized deal |
| [[FCAS]] (6th-gen fighter) | [[Dassault Aviation]] uncooperative with [[Airbus]] on tech sharing | Paris hasn't intervened |
| "Buy European" | Procurement preference | Too protectionist; threatens China business |

[[Friedrich Merz]] has responded by aligning with [[Italy]]'s Meloni — presenting Germany and Italy as Europe's manufacturing/defense powerhouses. [[Leonardo]] as alternative defense partner to Dassault/French industry.

**New friction (Feb 2026):** Berlin explicitly criticized France for not spending enough on weapons. France's yawning deficit limits military spending, but Paris notes Germany's decades of underspending and free-riding under the Western nuclear umbrella.

**Nuclear deterrence bargain:** As Germany emerges as Europe's dominant conventional military power (€162B budget by 2029), France's nuclear deterrent becomes potential leverage. Proposed grand bargain: France shares nuclear umbrella with Germany in return for German willingness to contemplate joint defense financing. Even Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel has made the case for mutual European debt.

**Franco-German tank (MGCS):** Also falling significantly behind schedule, compounding FCAS frustration.
