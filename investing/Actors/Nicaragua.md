**Nicaragua** — Central American country under Ortega regime. Allied with Russia and China. Potential Monroe Doctrine target after Venezuela.

## Why Nicaragua matters

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Government | Daniel Ortega (authoritarian) |
| Russia ties | Military cooperation, diplomatic support |
| China ties | Infrastructure investment, diplomatic recognition |
| US relations | Hostile, sanctions in place |

## Russia/China presence

**Russian:**
- Military advisors present
- Naval port access discussions
- Weapons supplies
- Diplomatic backing at UN

**Chinese:**
- Nicaragua Canal project (proposed, stalled)
- Infrastructure investment
- Switched recognition from Taiwan (2021)
- Belt and Road participant

---

## Monroe Doctrine risk

**Why Nicaragua could be next:**
- Ortega openly anti-US
- Russian military presence in hemisphere
- Strategic location (Central America)
- Precedent set by Venezuela action

**Differences from Venezuela:**
- No major oil reserves
- Smaller economy
- Less strategic value
- Lower priority target

---

## Nicaragua Canal (proposed)

**$50B Chinese project:**
- Alternative to Panama Canal
- Hong Kong investor (HKND)
- Stalled since 2014
- Environmental/feasibility concerns
- Unlikely to proceed

If revived, would be major Monroe Doctrine flashpoint.

## Investment implications

**Limited direct investment relevance** — small economy, sanctions.

**Indirect relevance:**
- Signals US posture toward Russia/China in hemisphere
- Affects risk premium for Latin America
- Watch for sanctions escalation
