## Venezuela relevance

**Limited:**

- Venezuela mostly onshore/shallow water
- Transocean is deepwater-focused
- Not a primary Venezuela play

**Broader offshore:** Benefits from Brazil, Guyana, West Africa, not Venezuela.

- Day rate momentum
- Premium fleet

- Energy security driving offshore

**Bear:**
- High debt burden
