**Netflix** — [[Streaming]] pioneer and leader. Nasdaq: NFLX. 325M subscribers (Q4 2025). Ad tier driving growth. Walked away from [[Warner Bros Discovery]] acquisition Feb 2026; collected $2.8B breakup fee.

Largest pure-play streaming company with ~$365B market cap, 325M subscribers, $39B 2024 revenue, and $50.7-51.7B guided for 2026. Ad tier is the primary growth driver. Attempted the largest M&A in streaming history — an $83B all-cash bid for Warner Bros Discovery (HBO, DC, Warner Bros studio) — but walked away Feb 2026 after Paramount's hostile $108B counterbid, collecting a $2.8B breakup fee. Content spend planned at $20B for 2026. The bull case: dominant global streaming position, ad tier monetization inflection, $2.8B breakup fee is pure profit, and content library + originals moat deepens. The bear case: YouTube's growing TV dominance (~13% viewing share vs Netflix ~9%), content cost inflation, and the WBD walk-away leaves the IP acquisition thesis unfulfilled.

## Warner Bros acquisition (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026, collapsed)

Netflix bid for [[Warner Bros Discovery]] studios + HBO/HBO Max — largest M&A attempt in [[Streaming]] history. Deal collapsed Feb 26 when Netflix walked away.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $27.75/share all-cash |
| Deal value | ~$83B |
| Announced | Dec 5, 2025 |
| Structure change | Cash+stock → all-cash (Jan 2026, to counter [[Paramount Global]]) |
| Rival bid | [[Paramount Global]] Skydance hostile bid — $108B for all of WBD |
| Outcome | Netflix walked away Feb 26; $2.8B breakup fee received |

What Netflix would have gotten:
- HBO/HBO Max — prestige content brand, ~117M subscribers
- Warner Bros studio — theatrical + TV production (one of "Big Five")
- Content library — DC, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, Sopranos, etc.
- DC Studios — superhero franchise
- Warner Bros Games, Tours, Retail
- Studio facilities — Burbank + Leavesden

What would have stayed with "Discovery Global":
- CNN, TBS, HGTV, Discovery Channel, TNT Sports
- [[Linear TV]] networks spin off separately

Strategic rationale:
- Primarily vertical merger (distribution + production)
- HBO as premium "add-on" — 80% of HBO Max subs already have Netflix
- 100 years of iconic IP + theatrical distribution capability
- Counter [[YouTube]]'s growing TV dominance (~13% viewing share vs Netflix ~9%)

Regulatory status before collapse:
- DOJ Antitrust Division reviewing
- [[EU]] authorities reviewing
- Senate hearing held Feb 3, 2026 — [[Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing 2026-02-03|full notes]]
- Key risk: market definition (SVOD-only → 30%+ share = presumption of illegality)
- [[Ted Sarandos]] pledged 45-day theatrical windows under oath

### Feb 26 — Deal collapses; Netflix walks away

[[Warner Bros Discovery]] board declared [[Paramount Global]] Skydance's $31/share all-cash bid a "Superior Proposal." Netflix elected not to match or raise its $27.75/share offer. Netflix receives a $2.8B breakup fee.

[[Ted Sarandos]] had telegraphed this: "We're super-disciplined buyers... willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things." Netflix stock rose on the news — market approved the discipline.

The strategic rationale for HBO/DC/WB content remains valid. Netflix retains the option to pursue other studio assets or build internally with its $20B content budget.

### Post-walkaway: Netflix wins by losing (Feb 27, 2026)

NFLX surged **+8.3%** on Feb 25 (as walkaway became likely), then another **+9%** on Feb 27 (formal confirmation) — heading for its best daily performance since Jan 2025. Two-day move from $75 area low to $92+. The market's verdict: losing the auction was winning.

**The haul from losing:**
- **$2.8B breakup fee** — pure profit for not buying something
- **$5B share buyback program** — deploying capital that would've gone to WBD
- **$20B content budget** for 2026 — unchanged, zero integration distraction
- **Clean balance sheet** — no $83B in new debt/dilution

**The Sarandos move:** He was at the White House the day he walked away. Went to DC on Feb 26, presumably to gauge regulatory appetite for a studio acquisition, then pulled the trigger immediately — didn't even use the 4-day matching window he was entitled to. Either supreme discipline or he learned something in Washington that made the math worse.

**Strategic position is arguably stronger than if they'd won:**
- The vertical integration thesis (studio + distribution) remains valid — they can revisit it later
- $20B/year content spend lets them build or license what they need organically
- If Paramount stumbles under $111B of debt in tightening credit markets, or hits antitrust walls, Netflix could come back for pieces of WBD at a discount
- They're the only major streamer *not* drowning in M&A integration complexity — Disney digesting Fox, Paramount digesting WBD, while Netflix just... makes content
- The breakup fee precedent is interesting: Netflix proved it can credibly threaten M&A (forcing higher prices for rivals) and still walk away profitably

**The bear read:** The HBO/DC/WB IP is genuinely irreplaceable. You can't "build" Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, or the DC universe with a $20B content budget. If the Paramount-WBD merger closes and integration goes well, Netflix faces a combined studio/streaming rival with vastly deeper IP. The walk-away was disciplined but may look short-sighted in 5 years.

**The bull read:** Sarandos just watched Paramount commit to $111B of execution risk in the worst credit environment since 2022, with DOJ review pending, activist shareholders circling, and linear TV assets (CNN, TBS) that are melting ice cubes. Netflix keeps its optionality, its balance sheet, and $2.8B of Paramount's money. If the deal blows up, they'll be there to pick up the pieces.
