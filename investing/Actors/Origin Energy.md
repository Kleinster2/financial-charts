## Data center pivot

Origin sees two paths from the AI-driven DC buildout:

1. **Energy supplier** — selling power to data centers driving future demand growth
2. **Co-location** — hosting data centers on Origin-owned land where energy infrastructure already exists (Eraring, Mortlake)

Eraring (NSW) is a live opportunity: 2,880 MW coal plant closing April 2029. Origin already building a grid-scale battery on-site. The thesis is that retiring power plants have grid connections, land, and infrastructure that data centers need.

### Australia DC context
