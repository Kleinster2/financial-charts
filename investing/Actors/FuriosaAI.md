## Why FuriosaAI matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | ~$700M |
| Founded | 2017 |
| Employees | ~200 |
| HQ | Seoul (Gangnam) |
| Status | Private |

**The pitch:** Inference-optimized NPU chips that match NVIDIA GPU performance at half the power consumption.

---

## Key product: RNGD

| Spec | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Name | RNGD ("Renegade") |
| Type | NPU (Neural Processing Unit) |
| Target | AI inference (not training) |
| Mass production | January 2026 |
| Claim | 2x power efficiency vs NVIDIA H100 on Llama |

**Hot Chips 2024:** Presented RNGD running Meta's Llama with >2x power efficiency vs NVIDIA high-end chips.

## Founder: June Paik

| Background | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Education | Seoul National → UC Berkeley → Georgia Tech |
| Samsung | Memory chip engineer, led new product team |
| AMD | GPU design experience |
| Origin story | Learned AI from Stanford online courses while recovering from Achilles injury |

**Co-founder:** Hanjoon Kim (CTO) — also ex-Samsung.

**Philosophy:** "Blitzscaling" approach — fast decisions, risk-taking, long-term mission over short-term security.

## Traction

| Customer/Partner | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| Meta | Attempted acquisition (Furiosa declined) |
| [[OpenAI]] | Used chip for Seoul demo |
| LG AI Research | Testing, praised "excellent real-world performance" |
| Hot Chips audience | Google, Meta, Amazon engineers swarmed booth |

---

## Investment angle

**Inference vs training:**

| Market | Dominant player | Furiosa position |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Training | [[NVIDIA]] (GPUs) | Not competing |
| Inference | NVIDIA + others | Target market |

**Why inference matters:** Training happens once. Inference (using models) happens billions of times. Power efficiency = cost savings at scale.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | GPU incumbent | Dominant |
| [[Groq]] | LPU (inference) | Shipping |
| [[Cerebras]] | Wafer-scale | Training focus |
| Tenstorrent | RISC-V AI | Early |
| FuriosaAI | NPU (inference) | Mass production 2026 |
| [[Ascend]] (Huawei) | China domestic | Sanctioned |

## South Korea AI ecosystem

**Government push:**

- AI as national priority
- [[OpenAI]] opened Seoul office
- [[NVIDIA]] signed government GPU deal
- Talent pool from [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]]

**Furiosa advantage:** Korean semi expertise + startup agility.

---

## Bull case

- 2x power efficiency = real cost savings
- Meta wanted to acquire (validation)
- Inference market growing faster than training
- South Korea talent + government support
- NVIDIA's dominance invites competition

## Bear case

- NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem moat
- Unproven at scale
- Customer adoption risk
- Funding needs (competing vs NVIDIA is expensive)
- Still private, limited visibility
