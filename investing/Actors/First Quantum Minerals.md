## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Cobre Panama resolution = massive upside ($10B+ asset currently valued at ~$0)
- Kansanshi S3 adds growth even without Panama
- Trading at 1.3x book — deeply discounted
- Settlement talks underway
- [[Copper]] structural deficit supports price
- Zambian operations reliable and expanding

**Bear:**
- $4.75B net debt is heavy — $550M+ annual interest
- Cobre Panama may never reopen (political risk)
- If arbitration fails, $10B write-off
- Panama precedent — sovereign risk repricing
- Even with S3, FQM is smaller without Cobre Panama
- Nickel exposure (Ravensthorpe) is a drag

|----------|--------------|
| Cobre Panama full restart | Massive rerating — doubles+ |
| Negotiated settlement | Moderate upside |
| Permanent closure + arbitration award | Years of uncertainty |
| Permanent closure + no award | Severe downside |
