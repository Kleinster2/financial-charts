## Why this matters

**Century-old demand finally addressed:**

- **Port access**: Port of Santos handles 30% of Brazil's foreign trade — tunnel improves logistics
- **Travel time**: 40+ minutes (40km road) or unreliable ferry → 5 minutes direct
- **Jobs**: ~9,000 direct/indirect during construction
- **Population served**: ~2M people in Baixada Santista region
- **First in LatAm**: Brazil's first immersed tunnel technology

## Technical specs

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Total length | 1.5 km |
| Immersed section | 870 meters |
| Depth | 21 meters below water |
| Lanes | 3 per direction (6 total) |
| LRT | Dedicated light rail lane |
| Pedestrian/cyclist | Dedicated gallery |
| Construction method | Prefabricated concrete modules, floated and sunk |

**Immersed tunnel method:** Unlike excavated tunnels (metro-style), modules are precast in a dry dock, floated to site, then submerged and anchored to the seabed. More modern, less disruptive than traditional deep excavation.

---

## Route

Connects:
- **Santos side**: Outeirinhos / Macuco neighborhoods
- **Guarujá side**: Vicente de Carvalho district

Crosses the Santos estuary — currently served only by ferry or 40km road detour.

## Concession structure

**30-year BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) model:**

| Phase | Years | Activity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Construction | 1-5 (2026-2031) | Design, build, commission |
| Operations | 6-30 (2031-2055) | Operate, maintain, collect revenue |
| Transfer | Year 30 (2055) | Asset returns to Santos Port Authority |

### Revenue model

Likely hybrid structure:
- **User tolls** — Vehicles pay per crossing
- **Availability payments** — Government payments if toll revenue insufficient
- **LRT fees** — Light rail operator pays access fees

### Concessionaire obligations

- Maintain tunnel to specified standards
- Operate 24/7
- Meet safety and environmental requirements
- Fund major maintenance from reserves
- Return asset in good condition at end of term

### End of concession (2055)

Asset transfers to Santos Port Authority (APS) at no cost. Government can:
- Operate directly
- Re-tender new concession
- Integrate with broader transport network

## Investment relevance

**Why Santos-Guarujá matters:**

1. **Brazil infra proxy** — Landmark PPP shows Brazil can execute complex projects with foreign capital.

2. **CCCC expansion** — Chinese infrastructure giant expanding LatAm footprint via Mota-Engil partnership.

3. **Port logistics** — Improves access to Brazil's largest port (Santos handles 30% of foreign trade).

4. **[[Bradesco BBI]] / [[Itaú BBA]] deal flow** — Project finance, bond issuances likely to follow.

5. **Precedent** — Success could unlock more immersed tunnel projects in Brazil (Rio crossings, etc.).
