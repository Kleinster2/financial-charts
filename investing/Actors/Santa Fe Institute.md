**Santa Fe Institute (SFI)** — Independent research institute for complexity science. Founded 1984 by Los Alamos scientists including Murray Gell-Mann. Studies complex adaptive systems across physics, biology, economics, social systems. [[Michael Mauboussin]] is chairman emeritus; [[Bill Miller]] is Life Trustee.

## Why Santa Fe Institute matters

**Complexity science applied to markets.** SFI research on networks, emergence, and adaptive systems influences how investors like [[Michael Mauboussin]] and [[Bill Miller]] think about markets. Markets as complex adaptive systems — not efficient machines.

**Interdisciplinary approach:** Physicists, biologists, economists, computer scientists working together on fundamental questions.

## Key concepts

### Complex adaptive systems
Systems with many interacting agents that learn and adapt. Markets, ecosystems, economies, immune systems.

### Emergence
Macro-level patterns arising from micro-level interactions. No central control.

### Power laws
Fat-tailed distributions in complex systems. Extreme events more common than normal distributions predict.

### Path dependence
History matters. Small early advantages compound. Relevant for platform businesses.

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — nonprofit research institute.

**Why it matters:**
- Shapes thinking of influential investors (Miller, Mauboussin)
- Framework for understanding tech platforms, network effects
- Alternative to efficient market hypothesis
- Research on risk, tail events, non-linear dynamics

**Resources:**
