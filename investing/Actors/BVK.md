Bayerische Versorgungskammer. Bavarian pension fund managing €122B ($145B) for 2.8 million members — doctors, lawyers, stage workers, chimney sweeps. Germany's largest professional pension group.

## US real estate debacle

Partnered with [[Michael Shvo]] and [[Deutsche Finance Group]] starting 2018 to expand into US commercial real estate. Committed ~€1.6B equity across trophy properties:

**High-risk developments (€820M committed):**
- 685 Fifth Avenue (NYC) — Mandarin Oriental condos
- Beverly Hills — Mandarin Oriental condos (bulk sold after ~10 units in 3 years)
- Miami Beach — Raleigh project (site sold Oct 2025 for ~$270M)
- Transamerica Pyramid (SF) — renovation

**Existing properties (€770M committed):**
- 711 Fifth Avenue (NYC) — Coca-Cola building, acquired 2019 for >$900M
- Big Red/The Red (Chicago) — acquired Aug 2020 for $376M
- SoHo office building (NYC)

**Losses:** Written down ~€288M through Nov 2025. Warns worst-case losses could reach ~€850M (~$1B) on the high-risk developments.

## Compliance scandal

Internal probe found violations by Rainer Komenda (former head of real estate investments):
- "Inappropriately close relationships with business partners"
- Lavish business trips — high-end hotels, dinners at Casa Tua, Avra, Polo Bar
- Komenda's relative had internships at Deutsche Finance and Shvo's firm
- Komenda never escalated Serdar Bilgili's 2020 letter alleging Shvo expense fraud

Two senior managers departed. Findings passed to Munich prosecutor. Komenda fired, suing over dismissal.

## Response

- Hired Andreas Steimel (ex-Pimco Prime Real Estate) as interim head of property investments
- Looking to exit relationships with Shvo and Deutsche Finance
- Implementing enhanced KYC for business partners
- Reported 3.4% return for 2025 — other asset classes offset real estate losses

## Context

Part of broader pattern of German institutional money chasing yield in US CRE post-2010. See also: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, Berlin dentist pension (lost 50% in shrimp farms, hotels, startups). Revives "stupid German money" narrative from 2000s Hollywood tax shelters and subprime losses.
