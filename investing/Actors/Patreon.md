**Industry:** [[Creator economy]]

Subscription platform for creators — SFW-focused alternative to [[OnlyFans]]. Founded 2013 by musician [[Jack Conte]] and Sam Yam. Best take rate in industry (5-12%) but growth slowed post-COVID.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Creator payouts (lifetime) | $10B+ |
| Annual creator payouts | $2B+ |
| Paid memberships | 25M+ |
| Free memberships | 100M+ |
| Active creators | 250,000+ |
| Employees | ~400 |
| Valuation (peak, 2021) | $4B |
| Valuation (current) | ~$1.4B |

## Business model

**Subscription-first.** Fans pay monthly to support creators and access exclusive content. Patreon takes a cut based on plan tier.

| Plan | Take rate | Features |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Lite | 5% | Basic membership |
| Pro | 8% | + Merch, analytics |
| Premium | 12% | + Team accounts, priority support |

*Plus payment processing fees (~3%)*

**Best creator economics in industry** — OnlyFans takes 20%, YouTube ~45%, Twitch 50%. Patreon's low take rate is the moat.

## Founding story

**Jack Conte** was a YouTube musician (Pomplamoose, with wife Nataly Dawn). Despite millions of views, ad revenue was minimal. Built Patreon to let fans pay creators directly.

Co-founded with **Sam Yam** (Stanford roommate, engineer).

## Funding history

| Series F | 2021 | $155M | $4B | — |

**Total raised:** $412M

**Investors:** Thrive Capital, Index Ventures, Glade Brook Capital

## Valuation collapse

Peak valuation $4B (April 2021) during COVID creator boom. By 2022, internal valuation dropped 70% to ~$1.2B. Current estimate: ~$1.4B.

**Why:** Post-COVID normalization, slower growth, competition from YouTube memberships, Substack, etc.

## Platform metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Podcast payouts (2024) | $472M | Largest category |
| Video hours watched | 80M+ | — |
| Free → paid conversion | 700K/month | — |
| Patrons per creator | ~100 avg | Highly variable |

## IPO prospects

Management has met with advisors; could kick off process H2 2025 earliest. No syndicate engaged yet.

**Challenges:**
- Valuation reset from $4B to $1.4B
- Growth deceleration
- Competition from platform-native subscriptions (YouTube, Twitch)
- "Cannibalization risk" — creators moving to cheaper/integrated alternatives

## Competitive position

| Platform | Take rate | Focus | Patreon advantage |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Patreon** | 5-12% | SFW, all creators | Best economics |
| [[OnlyFans]] | 20% | Adult-dominant | SFW reputation |
| YouTube | 45% | Video | Independence |
| Substack | 10% | Newsletters | Broader content types |
| Ko-fi | 0-5% | Tips/one-time | Recurring revenue |

**Moat:** Best take rate + brand recognition + creator tools. But moat eroding as platforms add native subscriptions.

## Layoffs

**September 2022:** Laid off 80 employees (17% of workforce). Closed Berlin and Dublin offices. CEO cited economic slowdown.

## Leadership

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| Co-Founder & CEO | [[Jack Conte]] | Musician (Pomplamoose), YouTube creator |
| Co-Founder | Sam Yam | Stanford CS, engineer |

## Risks

- **Platform competition** — YouTube, Twitch, Substack building native subscriptions
- **Growth plateau** — COVID boom ended, creator market maturing
- **Valuation overhang** — 2021 investors underwater at current valuation
- **No discovery** — like OnlyFans, creators must bring own audience
