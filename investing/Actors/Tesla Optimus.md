## Why Optimus matters

Biggest company in humanoid race:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Tesla]] (TSLA) |
| Announced | 2021 (AI Day) |
| Status | Development/pilot |
| Target price | <$20K |
| Elon's claim | "More valuable than cars" |

---

## Elon's vision

**Most important product:**
- Bigger than EVs
- Bigger than FSD
- Mass-produced humanoid
- Every household eventually
- "10 billion humanoid market"

---

## Technical approach

**Tesla advantages:**
- FSD AI/neural nets
- Dojo supercomputer
- Manufacturing scale
- Battery/motors expertise
- Vertical integration

---

## Optimus Gen 2

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Height | 5'8" |
| Weight | 127 lbs |
| Speed | 5 mph |
| Hands | 11 DoF each |
| Actuators | Tesla-designed |

---

## Development timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2021 | Announced at AI Day |
| 2022 | Prototype demo |
| 2023 | Gen 2 revealed |
| 2024 | Factory pilots (limited) |
| 2025 | Gen 3 in development |
| 2025 | Original factory timeline abandoned |
| 2026+ | External sales? (TBD) |

**Note:** Tesla abandoned original factory deployment timeline per WSJ.

---

## Factory deployment

**Internal use first:**
- Tesla factories
- Material handling
- Assembly tasks
- Training data generation

Tesla is its own first customer.

## Reality check (WSJ Jan 2026)

**What demos don't show:**

| Claim | Reality (per WSJ) |
|-------|-------------------|
| Autonomous operation | Often teleoperated by engineers in VR suits |
| Dancing robots (Oct 2024) | Engineers controlling them backstage |
| Factory-ready | Many engineers doubt usefulness vs task-specific robots |
| Human-like hands | Still can't match human sensitivity/dexterity |
| Indoor navigation | Robots frequently fall over, need to be picked up |

**The teleoperation setup:**
- One engineer operates movements via bodysuit + VR headset
- One engineer monitors laptop
- Others watch performance
- Several engineers per robot

**Training data collection:**
- Hired people to wear cameras/backpacks 24/7
- Walking through Tesla offices to collect data
- Robots still topple frequently

## Skeptic voices

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Some Tesla engineers | Doubt usefulness — task-specific robots better |
| ARK Invest | Excluded Optimus from 2029 estimates |
| Ken Goldberg (Berkeley) | "Even a child could clear a dinner table" — shows the gap |
| Standard Bots CEO | Legs inferior to wheels for factory/warehouse |

**ARK's Tasha Keeney:** "Initial versions will likely have limited set of performable tasks."

---

## Legs vs wheels debate

**The stability problem:**

| Factor | Legs | Wheels |
|--------|------|--------|
| Stability | Inherently unstable | Stable |
| Power loss | Falls on someone | Stops safely |
| Factory use | Risky | Safer |
| Versatility | More environments | Flat surfaces |

Standard Bots (wheeled) argues humanoid form is wrong for industrial use.

## Manufacturing advantage

**Tesla's edge:**
- Knows mass production
- Battery cells in-house
- Motor expertise
- Gigafactory capacity
- Cost reduction DNA

Can Tesla out-manufacture startups?

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Tesla manufacturing scale
- FSD AI transfer
- <$20K target price
- Massive TAM if works
- Already in TSLA stock

**Bear:**
- Elon overpromises
- Startups ahead on demos
- Distraction from EVs
- Hardware is hard
- Timeline slips

---

## Valuation debate

**If Optimus works:**
- Morgan Stanley: +$10T addressable market
- ARK: Optimus could be worth >$10/TSLA share
- Bears: Vapor until proven
