## Investment case

Bull:
- Wellness economy is secular growth — post-COVID health consciousness accelerated demand
- Multi-channel model (membership + hospitality + real estate) diversifies revenue
- Branded residence model is capital-light — developer takes construction risk
- Founder team has consumer brand scaling experience (vitaminwater $4.1B exit, bai $1.75B exit)
- [[Auberge Resorts]] partnership provides luxury distribution without owning hotels
- 12 locations in pipeline = significant growth runway

Bear:
- Undisclosed revenue and funding — limited financial transparency
- Luxury wellness is cyclical and discretionary
- $375/month price point limits addressable market
- Branded residence model depends on real estate market conditions
- Competitive space — [[Equinox]], [[SoHo House]], Canyon Ranch, Aman all expanding wellness
- Scaling personalized medicine + Eastern healing is operationally complex
