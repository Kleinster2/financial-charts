## Key events

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 2024 | Launched as "Technology Brothers Podcast" (weekly) |
| Early 2025 | Pivoted to daily livestream format |
| Mar 2025 | Rebranded to TBPN; visual identity by [[Day Job]] agency |
| Late 2025 | Nearly sold out 2026 ad inventory |
| Feb 9, 2026 | Regional Super Bowl LX ad (Bay Area / Silicon Valley) |

## Brand and production

Visual identity created by [[Day Job]], an LA-based creative agency. Aesthetic combines forest-green "country club" palette, VHS effects, and [[Formula 1]]-inspired sponsor logo density. The hosts ring a "size gong" on-air to mark major funding rounds and breakthroughs — a signature bit. Traveling gongs are signed by guests; Zuckerberg and Nadella have signed as of late 2025.

## Competitive position

Part of a new wave of creator-led business media alongside shows like [[All-In Podcast]]. Differentiators:

- Category-exclusive sponsorship creates advertiser lock-in and pricing power
- Daily cadence at 3 hours — far more surface area than weekly competitors
- Silicon Valley distribution channel — founder/VC appearances function as signaling
- Bootstrapped and profitable — no VC pressure on editorial
- NYT called it "Silicon Valley's newest obsession"; profiled by Vanity Fair, WSJ, Adweek, The Information
