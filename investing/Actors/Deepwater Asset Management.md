## LOUP ETF

Originally launched in 2018 as a rules-based index ETF tracking the Deepwater Frontier Tech Index. Converted to actively managed in December 2025, allowing Munster's team to make discretionary picks rather than follow a static index.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | LOUP (NYSEArca) |
| Inception | 2018 |
| Conversion to active | Dec 2025 |
| Sub-advisers | Deepwater + Penserra Capital Management |
| 2025 return | +52% |
| Expense ratio | ~0.65% |

The active conversion signals Deepwater's confidence in their stock-picking edge — particularly in AI names where index-weight timing matters.

## Investment philosophy

Deepwater's thesis is that AI infrastructure spending is earlier than consensus believes — "second inning" in Munster's framing. Key positions include [[NVIDIA]], with the firm arguing that Wall Street's CY2027 growth estimates (~28%) are far too conservative (Munster targets 50%+).

The firm uses a podcast series called Pressure Points for real-time earnings analysis and market commentary. Munster is a frequent CNBC contributor, making him one of the more visible AI bulls in the asset management space.

## Pressure Points podcast (Feb 25, 2026) — NVIDIA Q4 FY26

Munster recorded immediately after [[NVIDIA]]'s Q4 FY26 earnings call. Key observations:

**Stock paradox:** Revenue growth *accelerated* (73% reported → 79% guided) yet stock was flat after hours. Munster compared this to [[Apple]]'s previous quarter beat-and-fade — persistent sustainability concerns overriding fundamentals.

**Supply/demand equilibrium headwind:** CFO [[Colette Kress]] said NVIDIA has enough inventory to meet demand for all of CY2026. Munster flagged this as paradoxically negative — when supply-constrained, investors can "dream up" how much bigger numbers could be. At equilibrium, "the numbers you see are what you get." A psychological ceiling on upside surprise optics.

**CY2027 growth:** Street at 28%, Munster expects revision to 35% by next morning, believes actual delivery will be 50%+ — implying consensus is systematically underestimating AI infrastructure duration.

**Jensen's "1000x manifesto":** The final 7 minutes of the call. Jensen compared old compute ($350B/year, static "DVD-like" software) to AI compute (real-time, generative, dynamic). Claimed AI compute demand is 1,000x greater. Munster: "It passed the sniff test." See [[Jensen 1000x compute thesis]].

**OpenClaw and Claude mention:** Munster referenced using AI agents at Deepwater — specifically mentioning [[OpenClaw]] and "Claude co-work" — as evidence that AI utility has had "a meaningful step forward" in recent months. Notable as a mainstream asset manager citing specific AI developer tools as investment thesis evidence.

**Bottom line:** Fundamentals will exceed expectations for many quarters. Stock goes higher but with "relatively less upside vs some other AI companies" due to size and persistent wall of worry. Deepwater owns NVDA.
