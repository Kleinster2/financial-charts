| **Composer** | Agentic coding model |
| **Tab completion** | Context-aware suggestions |
| **Chat** | Codebase-aware Q&A |
| **Multi-model** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, [[xAI]] |

**Philosophy:** AI should be the foundation of development, not just an assistant.

### Continual learning edge

Cursor updates Composer model weights **every 90 minutes** based on real-world user feedback. This is the closest thing to production [[Continual learning]] happening today — the model improves in near-real-time from how developers actually use it.

## Competitive positioning

| vs | Cursor advantage | Cursor weakness |
|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| [[GitHub Copilot]] | Full editor, agentic | Smaller install base |
| [[Claude Code]] | GUI, familiar UX | Less terminal power |
| Windsurf | First-mover, scale | Similar features |

**Thesis:** Developers want AI-native editors, not plugins on legacy tools.

## Investment implications

**Private company** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[NVIDIA]] — investor + GPU supplier
- [[Google]] — investor
- [[Accel]] portfolio companies

**Watch for:**
- IPO (likely 2026-2027 given scale)
- Competition from [[Microsoft]] (Copilot) and [[Anthropic]] ([[Claude]] Code)
- Enterprise penetration metrics
