# Humans&

AI startup building foundation models for human-AI collaboration rather than chat or task automation. Founded September 2025 by alumni from [[xAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Google DeepMind]], [[OpenAI]], and [[Meta]].

## What makes Humans& different

While most AI labs optimize for benchmarks and single-task completion, Humans& trains models for **multi-turn collaboration**—helping users clarify intent, propose plans, negotiate tradeoffs, and maintain extended context toward long-horizon goals.

The thesis: AI that strengthens how people work together is more valuable than AI that replaces them. This positions them against pure automation plays and toward collaborative infrastructure.

## Founding team

| Name | Role | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| Eric Zelikman | CEO | [[xAI]] (led Grok 2 post-training, Grok 3 reasoning RL, Grok 4 agent infrastructure); [[Stanford]] PhD; wrote STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner), first paper training LLMs to reason using their own rationales |
| Georges Harik | Co-founder, Lead investor | [[Google]] employee #7; wrote AdWords business plan, helped define AdSense targeting; recent research on Quiet-STaR and probabilistic programming |
| Noah Goodman | Co-founder | [[Stanford]] professor (psychology + CS); [[Google DeepMind]] (contributed to Gemini post-training); Zelikman's PhD advisor |
| Andi Peng | Co-founder | [[Anthropic]] (RL and post-training for Claude 3.5 through 4.5) |
| Yuchen He | Co-founder | [[xAI]] (helped develop [[Grok]]) |

The team combines frontier research credentials (STaR, Quiet-STaR, Gemini, Claude, Grok) with proven ability to ship at scale.

### Potential follow-on

Reports in January 2026 indicated Humans& was in talks to raise $1B at $5B valuation, though the $480M seed at $4.48B is what closed.

## Technical approach

- **Foundation models for collaboration, not chat** — diverging from conversational AI that dominates the market
- **Multi-agent coordination** — models designed to work together effectively
- **Human-centric training paradigm** — models remember and respond to individual preferences
- **Long-horizon RL** — training for extended collaboration rather than single-turn completion

The compute requirements are expected to exceed current mainstream methods due to the complexity of multi-turn, multi-agent training.

## Product

Humans& expects to launch a product in early 2026. Details not yet disclosed, but positioning suggests communication and collaboration tools for organizations.

## Competitive context

The $480M seed is one of the largest ever, though smaller than [[Thinking Machines Lab]]'s $2B seed at $10B valuation (led by former [[OpenAI]] CTO [[Mira Murati]]). Both represent investor appetite for next-gen AI labs founded by frontier researchers.

Humans& differentiates from "big labs" by focusing on collaborative AI rather than pure capability benchmarks—betting that human-AI teamwork creates more enterprise value than human replacement.
