## Why Fluence matters

Battery storage solves solar intermittency — essential for AI data centers:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ownership | Siemens + AES (JV) |
| Product | Grid-scale battery systems |
| Market position | Top 3 global |
| AI relevance | Enables 24/7 renewable power |

---

## The storage imperative

**Solar alone isn't enough:**
- Sun doesn't shine at night
- Data centers need 24/7 power
- Storage bridges the gap
- Enables higher renewable %

**Fluence's role:**
- Grid-scale battery systems
- 4-8 hour duration
- Software + hardware integration
- Utility and corporate customers

## Product portfolio

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Gridstack | Utility-scale battery system |
| Sunstack | Solar + storage integration |
| Mosaic | AI-powered software platform |
| Nispera | Asset management |

**Software differentiation:** Mosaic platform optimizes dispatch.

## Corporate parentage

**Siemens + AES joint venture:**
- Siemens: Technology, manufacturing
- AES: Project development, customers
- Combined expertise
- Access to capital

**Spun out as public company** but parents retain stakes.

## AI data center opportunity

**Storage enables renewables for data centers:**
- Solar + storage = dispatchable power
- Reduces grid dependency
- Co-located deployments growing
- [[Crusoe Energy]] example (12 MW solar + 63 MWh storage)

**Hyperscaler demand:**
- Google: 312 MW storage capacity (industry-leading)
- Others building storage portfolios
- Growing with solar procurement

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | Fluence vs |
|------------|----------|------------|
| [[Tesla Energy]] | Megapack brand | Enterprise focus |
| BYD | Low cost | Non-China supply |
| Samsung SDI | Cells | System integration |
| Wartsila | Energy storage | Software platform |

Fluence = pure-play grid storage leader.
