## Why Hines matters

**Institutional quality at scale.** Hines built its reputation developing trophy office buildings — Pennzoil Place, Williams Tower, 53rd at Third. The firm helped define institutional-grade real estate development and attracted pension funds and sovereign wealth as investors.

**Global reach.** Unlike most US developers, Hines operates across 30 countries with significant presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

**Investment management.** Beyond development, Hines runs 65 investment vehicles serving 300+ institutions, 700+ HNW individuals, and 170,000+ retail investors.
