Larry's Oracle is now infrastructure partner for the same [[ByteDance]] whose [[Seedance]] 2.0 is generating Hollywood-quality AI content from American IP.

Larry personally guaranteed Paramount Skydance's hostile bid for [[Warner Bros Discovery]] — **$43.6B equity commitment** alongside [[Gerry Cardinale\|RedBird Capital]] and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. $108.4B all-cash offer at $30/share. If both Paramount and WBD deals close, the Ellison family controls the deepest IP vault in entertainment.
