## Investment case

Bull:
- WBD acquisition would create most comprehensive media portfolio assembled
- [[Larry Ellison]] financial backing ($40B+ personal equity)
- Paramount+ reaching scale (72M subs)
- CBS sports rights + Pluto TV FAST leader
- Skydance merger resolved governance overhang

Bear:
- WBD deal massively leverages a company that's already struggling
- Q4 2025 earnings miss (-$0.12 adj EPS vs -$0.01 est)
- [[Linear TV]] networks declining across both companies
- Heavy combined debt ($15B Paramount + WBD's debt)
- Integration complexity of two struggling media empires
- PSKY at $11.18 — stock down ~40% from post-Skydance peak

---

## Q4 2025 (reported Feb 26, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 | vs Est |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Adj EPS | -$0.12 | Miss (est. -$0.01) |
| Stock | $11.16 | 12-month range $9.95 - $20.86 |

Weak quarter overshadowed by WBD bid victory on the same day.

## WBD acquisition (Feb 2026)

[[Warner Bros Discovery]] board declared Paramount Skydance's $31/share all-cash bid a "Superior Proposal" on Feb 26. [[Netflix]] declined to match its competing $27.75 offer and walked away with a $2.8B breakup fee.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Bid | $31/share all-cash for all of WBD |
| Enterprise value | ~$77B |
| Netflix breakup fee | $2.8B (WBD pays to Netflix) |
| Shareholder vote | March 20, 2026 |
| HSR status | Cleared Feb 20 (Paramount's CLO is Makan Delrahim, former Trump DOJ Antitrust chief) |
| Financial backstop | [[Larry Ellison]] $40B personal equity guarantee |

If approved, the combined entity would hold CBS, Paramount+, MTV, HBO, CNN, Discovery, TBS, TNT Sports, Warner Bros studio, DC — the most comprehensive media portfolio assembled since the old [[AT&T]]-TimeWarner.

Timeline: initial $30 bid (Feb 10) → $30 rejected, 7-day window (Feb 17) → $31 "best and final" (Feb 23) → Superior Proposal declared (Feb 26).

Open risks: $1.5B junior lien financing fee, combined debt load, [[Larry Ellison]] equity guarantee certainty, activist shareholder dynamics at March 20 vote.

## Charts

![[psky-price-chart.png]]
*PSKY since Jan 2024 (includes PARA pre-merger). Spiked to $20 on Skydance close (Aug 2025), then steadily declined to $11.18 on Q4 miss and WBD acquisition financing concerns*

![[paramount-global-fundamentals-chart.png]]
*Revenue stepped up with CBS-Viacom re-merger (2019). Net income has been volatile — massive write-downs in 2008 and 2022-2024 from content impairments and streaming losses*

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2021 | $28.6B | $4.3B | ViacomCBS; streaming launch year |
| 2022 | $30.2B | -$1.8B | Streaming losses, restructuring |
| 2023 | $29.7B | -$1.3B | Streaming losses narrowing |
| 2024 | $28.6B | -$5.9B | Content write-downs; Skydance deal costs |

Revenue flat at ~$29B. Chronic streaming losses and content write-downs have produced negative net income for three consecutive years. The Skydance merger brought fresh capital but the WBD acquisition would add ~$39B in WBD revenue and significant additional debt.

## Leadership

| Person | Role | Since |
|--------|------|-------|
| [[David Ellison]] | CEO | Aug 2025 (Skydance merger) |
| Jeff Shell | President | Aug 2025 |
| Chris McCarthy | CEO, Showtime/MTV | 2023 |
| George Cheeks | CEO, CBS | 2020 |

[[David Ellison]] replaced Bob Bakish as CEO after the Skydance merger closed.
