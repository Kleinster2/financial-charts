## Hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery (Feb 2026)

Post-Skydance merger, Paramount launched a **hostile $30/share all-cash bid for all of [[Warner Bros Discovery]]** — enterprise value ~$108.4B including debt. Competing with [[Netflix]]'s $27.75 carve-out offer.

- **Feb 10:** Sweetened with **25¢/share quarterly ticking fee** if not closed by Dec 31, 2026
- Would create a massive combined media empire (CBS + Paramount+ + HBO/Max + CNN + Discovery networks)
- WBD board told shareholders to take no action
- **Massive antitrust risk** — Senate hearing Feb 3, DOJ review ongoing
- Activist Ancora pushing WBD to engage

This would be the largest media merger ever if completed. The strategic logic: Paramount gains HBO/Max content library, Warner Bros studios, and CNN to complement CBS and Paramount+.
