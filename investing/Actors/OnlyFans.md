**Industry:** [[Sextech]]

Subscription platform for creators — 80% adult content, 20% fitness/music/cooking. Founded 2016 in UK, 100% owned by [[Leonid Radvinsky]] since 2018. The most profitable creator platform ever built: $684M pre-tax profit on $1.4B revenue (48% margin).

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross payments (2024) | $7.2B |
| Platform revenue (2024) | $1.4B |
| Pre-tax profit (2024) | $684M |
| Profit margin | ~48% |
| Creators | 4.6M |
| Fan accounts | 377.5M |
| Employees | 46 (+ contractors) |
| Take rate | 20% |

## Business model

**Simple and brutal:** 20% of everything. Subscriptions, PPV, tips, live streaming — all 80/20 split to creators. No ads, no data monetization, just rake.

| Revenue stream | Creator cut | OnlyFans cut |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Subscriptions ($4.99-$49.99/mo) | 80% | 20% |
| Pay-per-view content | 80% | 20% |
| Tips | 90% | 10% |
| Live streaming | 80% | 20% |

**Why it works:**
- Highest creator payout in industry (Patreon takes 5-12%, YouTube ~45%)
- No discovery algorithm — creators bring their own audience
- Adult content tolerated (unlike YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
- Simple UX, reliable payments

**Key insight:** 60% of creator revenue comes from single purchases (PPV), not subscriptions. Single-purchase revenue grew 70% ($1.6B) from 2021-2023 vs 9% for subscriptions. Tips and PPV drive engagement.

## Creator economics

| Tier | Earnings | % of creators |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Top 1% | 33% of total revenue | ~46K creators |
| $1M+/year | 1,200+ creators | <0.1% |
| Bottom 50% | <$100/month | ~2.3M creators |

**Power law distribution.** Most creators earn almost nothing. Platform makes money regardless — 20% of $0 is $0, but 20% of top creators' millions adds up.

## Ownership

**100% owned by [[Leonid Radvinsky]]** — Ukrainian-American who bought 75% stake from founders Tim and Guy Stokely in 2018, later acquired remaining 25%.

| Year | Dividends to Radvinsky |
|------|------------------------|
| 2021-2024 | ~$1.8B total |
| 2024 | $497M |
| Post-2024 | +$204M |

**Net worth:** $7.8B (Forbes, Oct 2025)

## Potential sale

Bloomberg reported (May 2025) OnlyFans exploring sale at $7-8B valuation. Consortium led by Forest Road Company in talks; British billionaires David and Simon Reuben may join.

**Why sell now:** Radvinsky has extracted $1.8B+ in dividends. Platform growth slowing (9% YoY vs 20%+ historically). Adult content limits strategic options.

## Platform integrations

**[[Lovense]] exclusive partner** (June 2024) — only live streaming software on OnlyFans supporting tip-activated vibrations. This is significant: cam models using Lovense can offer interactive experiences, driving both OnlyFans engagement and Lovense hardware sales.

## Competitive position

| Platform | Take rate | Adult allowed | Discovery |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **OnlyFans** | 20% | Yes | None (BYOA) |
| Patreon | 5-12% | Limited | None |
| YouTube | ~45% | No | Algorithm |
| Fansly | 20% | Yes | Limited |
| Pornhub | ~65% | Yes | Algorithm |

**Moat:** Brand recognition in adult creator space + payment processing relationships (hard to replicate — banks/cards avoid adult). No network effects though — creators can leave anytime.

## Risks

- **Creator concentration** — top 1% = 33% of revenue; if top creators leave, revenue craters
- **Payment processing** — Mastercard/Visa could restrict (almost happened in 2021)
- **Regulation** — UK age verification, US state laws
- **No discovery** — platform is a payment processor, not a destination; creators own the relationship
- **Competition** — Fansly, Fanvue growing; lower take rates possible
