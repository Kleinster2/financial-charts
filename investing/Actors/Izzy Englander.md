### The "pod" model

Englander pioneered the multi-manager "pod" structure — now industry standard:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Independent PMs | Each team runs own book |
| Central risk | Firm-wide risk limits, drawdown rules |
| Diversification | Hundreds of uncorrelated strategies |
| Quick cuts | Underperformers removed fast |
| Talent pipeline | Constant PM recruitment |

**Legacy**: Citadel, Point72, Balyasny, and others copied this model.

---

## Investment philosophy

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Risk management | More important than returns |
| Diversification | Hundreds of pods = low correlation |
| Talent over ideas | Allocate to proven managers |
| Process over conviction | Systematic approach to PM selection |
| Capital efficiency | Return excess capital to maintain edge |

**Key insight**: Englander doesn't pick stocks — he picks stock-pickers. Focus on organizational design and risk controls.
