**[[Brazil]] AI** — $4B AI plan (2024-2028). 93.6% renewable energy. Dual-track legislation: REDATA (DC incentives) + Marco Legal (AI governance).

---

## Why [[Brazil]] matters

Clean energy + AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI Plan budget | $4B (2024-2028) |
| Renewable energy | 93.6% of grid |
| DC market 2029 | $5.96B projected |
| AWS investment | $1.8B (Sept 2024) |

---

## Brazilian AI Plan (PBIA)

**2024-2028 strategy:**
- BRL 23B (~$4B) investment
- AI infrastructure buildout
- Capacity building
- Portuguese language models
- Amazon deforestation monitoring

## Renewable energy advantage

**Why hyperscalers want [[Brazil]]:**

| Factor | [[Brazil]] |
|--------|--------|
| Renewable % | 93.6% |
| Hydro power | Abundant |
| Solar/wind | Growing |
| Carbon footprint | Minimal |
| Energy cost | Competitive |

Clean AI = [[Brazil]]'s pitch.

## Data center boom

**Hyperscaler investments:**

| Company | Investment |
|---------|------------|
| AWS | $1.8B expansion (2024) |
| Microsoft | Azure [[Brazil]] regions |
| Google | GCP presence |
| [[Oracle]] | Data centers |

## REDATA (Special Tax Regime for Data Centers)

**PM 1,318/2025** — Published September 18, 2025. Brazil's flagship policy to attract hyperscale DC investment.

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Legislation | Provisional Measure 1,318/2025 |
| Effective | January 1, 2026 |
| Budget | R$5.2B (2026 budget bill) |
| Investment potential | **R$2T over 10 years** |
| Duration | 5 years (PIS/Cofins/IPI only through Dec 2026 due to tax reform) |

### Tax suspensions

| Tax | Type |
|-----|------|
| PIS/Cofins | Social contributions (suspended) |
| IPI | Excise tax (suspended) |
| Import duties | Fixed assets, if no domestic equivalent (up to 5 years) |

### Eligibility requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Domestic market allocation | ≥10% of capacity |
| Energy source | **100% clean/renewable** |
| Water usage effectiveness | ≤0.05 L/kWh (annual) |
| R&D investment | ≥2% of acquired product value |
| Regional incentive | 20% lower domestic requirement for North/Northeast/Central-West |

### Legislative status

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| PM published | September 17, 2025 |
| Public consultation closed | October 26, 2025 |
| Tax benefits effective | January 1, 2026 |
| **Conversion deadline** | **February 25, 2026** |

**⚠️ Legislative risk:** As of late January 2026, Congress has not formed the Joint Committee to review PM 1,318/25. Industry groups urging prioritization. If not converted to law by Feb 25, the PM expires and tax benefits end.

**Why it matters:** Positions Brazil as LatAm's AI infrastructure hub. The 100% renewable + strict WUE requirements align with hyperscaler sustainability mandates. R$2T investment potential = decades of DC buildout — but hinges on Congressional action.

## Marco Legal (PL 2338/2023)

**Brazil's AI governance framework** — mirrors EU AI Act but emphasizes social inclusion. Separate from REDATA (infrastructure); this is the "govern it" legislation.

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Introduced | 2023 |
| Senate approval | December 10, 2024 |
| Sent to Chamber | March 17, 2025 |
| Special committee formed | April 29, 2025 |
| **Status** | **In Chamber of Deputies** |

### Key provisions

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Risk classification | Tiered system (like EU AI Act) |
| Civil liability | Rules for AI-caused harm |
| SIA | National System for AI Regulation and Governance |
| LGPD integration | Parallel with data protection law |
| Social inclusion | Unique LatAm emphasis on fairness |

### Other AI regulations already in force

| Regulation | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| CNJ Resolution 615/2025 | Judiciary AI governance — risk framework, mandatory registration in "Sinapses" platform, human-in-the-loop for judicial decisions |
| Law 15.123/2025 | Increased penalties for AI-enabled psychological violence against women |

**Political context:** Lula administration pushing to pass before 2026 elections. If enacted, Brazil becomes LatAm's AI regulatory leader — potential model for Argentina, Chile.
