## Why Boston Dynamics matters

Most famous robotics company:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Hyundai (80%) |
| Acquired | 2021 for $1.1B |
| Founded | 1992 (MIT spin-out) |
| Robots | Spot, Atlas, Stretch |

---

## Ownership history

**Passed around:**

| Owner | Period |
|-------|--------|
| MIT spin-out | 1992 |
| Google | 2013-2017 |
| SoftBank | 2017-2021 |
| Hyundai | 2021-present |

Struggled to commercialize.

## Robot portfolio

| Robot | Type | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Spot | Quadruped | Commercial |
| Atlas | Humanoid | R&D |
| Stretch | Warehouse | Commercial |
| Handle | Logistics | Discontinued |

---

## Spot

**Commercial success:**
- Quadruped (dog-like)
- Industrial inspection
- $75K price point
- Thousands deployed
- Revenue generator

## Atlas

**CES 2026: Production-ready**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Degrees of freedom | 56 |
| Reach | 7.5 feet |
| Lifting capacity | 110 lbs |
| Battery | 4 hours, hot-swappable |
| Status | **Production-ready** |

**First deployments (2026):**
- [[Hyundai]] Metaplant Georgia — factory automation
- [[Google]] DeepMind Gemini Robotics partnership — AI foundation models for manipulation and reasoning

**Google DeepMind partnership (Jan 2026):**
- Integrating Gemini Robotics vision-language models into Atlas
- Goal: general-purpose manipulation without task-specific programming
- Combines BD hardware (56 DOF, production-ready) with DeepMind's foundation model approach
- Positions Atlas as AI-native humanoid (vs competitors using narrower autonomy stacks)

**History:**
- Most advanced humanoid demos (parkour, backflips)
- Electric version (2024)
- Finally entering production after years of R&D

---

## Hyundai synergy

**Industrial robotics:**
- Factory automation
- Automotive manufacturing
- Hyundai's robot ambitions
- Korean conglomerate backing

## CES 2026 competitive landscape

**China dominance at CES 2026:**
- 21 of 38 humanoid exhibitors were Chinese companies
- 7,705 humanoid patents filed in China in 5 years (vs US 1,561)
- 150+ humanoid robot companies in China
- [[UBTECH]] Walker S2: 1,000+ delivered (Nov 2025) — "world's first mass delivery"
- Unitree: G1/H2/R1 lineup, affordability-focused

**Boston Dynamics' moat:** Production-readiness + DeepMind AI partnership differentiates from Chinese volume play. Hardware quality (56 DOF, 110 lbs lift) exceeds Chinese competitors. But China moving fast on cost/volume curve.

**Nature assessment (Jan 2026):** Humanoid robots "on brink of being commercially useful" — cheaper parts, better batteries, AI algorithms all converging.

## Commercialization challenge

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| High R&D costs | Multiple owners |
| Spot is niche | Limited TAM |
| Atlas entering production | First revenue 2026 |
| Competition | Chinese startups + Tesla catching up |

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable:**
- Part of Hyundai Motor Group
- Small % of Hyundai value
- Watch for spin-off
- Hyundai (HYMTF) = indirect

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Hyundai (80%) |
| Acquired | $1.1B (2021) |
| Commercial robot | Spot |
| Status | Subsidiary |
