## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 1992 (MIT spin-out) |
| Owner | [[Hyundai]] Motor Group (80%, acquired 2021 for $1.1B) |
| HQ | Waltham, MA |
| Robots | Spot, Atlas, Stretch |
| Atlas production capacity | 30,000 units/year by 2028 (planned) |
| AI partner | [[Google DeepMind]] ([[Gemini]] Robotics) |

## Evolution

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1992 | MIT spin-out (Marc Raibert) |
| 2013 | Acquired by [[Google]] (X division) |
| 2017 | Sold to [[SoftBank]] — Google couldn't commercialize |
| 2021 | Acquired by [[Hyundai]] for $1.1B (80% stake) |
| 2024 | Electric Atlas unveiled — retired hydraulic version |
| Jan 2026 | Atlas production-ready, CES Best Robot, [[Google DeepMind]] AI partnership |

Three owners in a decade — each struggled to commercialize the technology. [[Hyundai]] is the first with a clear deployment pathway: its own factories.

## Robot portfolio

| Robot | Type | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Spot | Quadruped | Commercial (hundreds of customers) |
| Atlas | Humanoid | Production-ready (2026 deployments committed) |
| Stretch | Warehouse | Commercial (DHL $15M pre-order, Maersk deal) |
| Handle | Logistics | Discontinued |

---

## Spot

Quadruped (dog-like). Industrial inspection, construction monitoring, hazardous environments. ~$75K price point. Hundreds of customers globally (2025). Primary revenue generator today.

---

## Atlas

CES 2026: Best Robot award (CNET). Production-ready. All 2026 deployments fully committed.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Degrees of freedom | 56 |
| Reach | 7.5 feet |
| Lifting capacity | 110 lbs |
| Battery | 4 hours, hot-swappable |
| Actuators | Supplied by [[Hyundai]] Mobis |

Deployment timeline:

| Phase | Timeline | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Training at RMAC | 2026 | Robotics Metaplant Application Center |
| Sequencing tasks at HMGMA | 2028 | [[Hyundai]] Metaplant Georgia |
| Complex assembly operations | 2030 | Full factory integration |
| Production capacity | 2028 | 30,000 units/year (Robotics Innovation Hub) |

[[Google DeepMind]] partnership (Jan 2026): Integrating [[Gemini]] Robotics vision-language models into Atlas. Goal: general-purpose manipulation without task-specific programming. Combines BD hardware (56 DOF) with DeepMind's foundation model approach. Positions Atlas as AI-native humanoid.

Stretch: Warehouse box-moving robot. DHL Supply Chain placed $15M pre-order (first commercial purchase). Performance Team (Maersk) signed multi-year agreement.

## Hyundai integration

[[Hyundai]] Motor Group CES 2026 AI Robotics Strategy — three pillars:
1. Deploy co-working robots alongside humans in manufacturing
2. Build end-to-end AI robotics value chain with Boston Dynamics
3. Partner with [[Google DeepMind]] and [[NVIDIA]] for training, simulation, commercialization

Investment: $26B in US operations through 2028 (including $5B additional announced at CES). Robotics Innovation Hub with 30,000 units/year capacity. Expected to create 25,000 direct jobs by 2028.

Hyundai Mobis supplying actuators — building a reliable component supply chain is critical for scaling from R&D to tens of thousands of units.

## CES 2026 competitive landscape

[[China]] dominance at CES 2026:
- 21 of 38 humanoid exhibitors were Chinese companies
- 7,705 humanoid patents filed in [[China]] in 5 years (vs US 1,561)
- 150+ humanoid robot companies in [[China]]
- [[UBTECH]] Walker S2: 1,000+ delivered (Nov 2025) — "world's first mass delivery"
- Unitree: G1/H2/R1 lineup, affordability-focused

Boston Dynamics' moat: Production-readiness + DeepMind AI partnership differentiates from Chinese volume play. Hardware quality (56 DOF, 110 lbs lift) exceeds Chinese competitors. But [[China]] moving fast on cost/volume curve.

Nature assessment (Jan 2026): Humanoid robots "on brink of being commercially useful" — cheaper parts, better batteries, AI algorithms all converging.

## Investment implications

Not directly investable — subsidiary of [[Hyundai]] Motor Group. Indirect exposure via Hyundai (KRX: 005380, US ADR: HYMTF). Boston Dynamics is a small % of Hyundai's value today, but if Atlas production scales to 30,000 units/year, the robotics division could become material. Watch for potential spin-off.
