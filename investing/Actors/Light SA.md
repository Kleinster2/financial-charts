## Nelson Tanure / WNT involvement

[[Nelson Tanure]] built a 21.8% position via [[WNT Gestora]] during 2023, becoming largest shareholder just before the judicial recovery filing. Elected to the board Jul 2023. The WNT fund also held resources from [[Daniel Vorcaro]] ([[Banco Master]]). After the Master collapse (Nov 2025), Vorcaro sold his WNT stake to [[BTG Pactual]], which now holds ~15% and dominates the recovery process. Creditors seized ~9.9% of Tanure's shares in Feb 2026 as cross-collateral for the [[Ligga Telecom]] debt.
