## Investment exposure

**No direct investment** — YouTube is a segment of [[Alphabet]] (GOOGL/GOOG).

At ~$550B implied valuation (30% of Alphabet), YouTube is:
- Larger than Netflix ($275B)
- Larger than Disney ($175B)
- Comparable to Meta ($1.5T at 30% = $450B)

**YouTube thesis = Alphabet thesis.** If you're bullish on YouTube's creator economy dominance, short-form video momentum, and TV disruption, buy GOOGL.

## Risks

- **TikTok competition** — Shorts gaining but TikTok still leads engagement
- **Regulatory** — Antitrust scrutiny of Google/Alphabet
- **Creator economics pressure** — Competitors offering better splits
- **Ad market cyclicality** — 90%+ of revenue is advertising
