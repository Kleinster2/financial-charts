**Cohu (COHU)** — semiconductor test handler company, beneficiary of [[Final test bottleneck]].

## Core thesis

Cohu makes the equipment that handles chips during final test. As AI packages get larger and hotter, legacy handlers can't cope — driving an equipment refresh cycle. Cohu's Eclipse platform is positioned for extreme thermal AI testing.

---

## What they do

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Test handlers | Move chips through test, manage thermals |
| ATC systems | Active Thermal Control for high-heat parts |
| Contactors/sockets | Interface between chip and test equipment |

They don't test chips — they make the equipment that OSATs ([[ASE]]) and IDMs use to test.

---

## Why they benefit from AI

- Larger packages → need new handlers (size)
- Higher heat → need ATC (thermal)
- Legacy pogo pins melt → socket refresh cycle
- Each AI generation = potential equipment upgrade

---

## Key product

**Eclipse platform** — selected for testing next-gen AI processors in extreme thermal conditions. Addresses the ~120mm package, high-heat challenge.

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | COHU (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$1.5B (small cap) |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$500M |
| Segment | Test handlers, contactors |
| Gross margin | ~45% |
| P/E | ~25x (cyclical) |

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| [[Advantest]] | ATE (test equipment), different segment |
| Teradyne | ATE, some handler overlap |
| Xcerra | Smaller player |

Cohu is more specialized in handlers vs. the broader ATE players.

## Customers

- OSATs: [[ASE]], Amkor
- IDMs: Intel, [[Texas Instruments]]
- Foundry test operations

---

## Market expectations

**Priced in:**
- Cyclical recovery
- General semi demand

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- AI handler refresh cycle bigger than expected
- Eclipse wins at major OSATs
- Thermal constraints become industry bottleneck

---

## Risks

- Small cap, volatile
- Cyclical — semi downturns hit equipment hard
- Concentrated customer base
- Competition from larger ATE players

---

## For theses

- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — pure play on test bottleneck
- Small cap = more volatile, higher beta
- Foundry-agnostic: benefits regardless of [[TSMC]] vs [[Samsung]] outcome
