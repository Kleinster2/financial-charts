**Arm Holdings** — Semiconductor IP company. Architecture in every smartphone, expanding to AI/servers. [[SoftBank]]'s crown jewel.

---

## Why Arm matters

Arm doesn't make chips — it licenses the architecture that others use:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | Near-monopoly in mobile CPU IP |
| Chips shipped | 250B+ cumulative |
| Royalty model | Per-chip royalties + licensing fees |
| Owner | [[Masayoshi Son]] / [[SoftBank]] (~90%) |

## Business model

**IP licensing:**
- Arm designs CPU architectures
- Licenses to chip makers (Apple, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, etc.)
- Charges upfront license fee + per-chip royalty
- Asset-light, high margin

**Customers (everyone):**
- [[Apple]] (M-series, A-series)
- Qualcomm (Snapdragon)
- [[NVIDIA]] (Grace CPU)
- [[Amazon]] (Graviton)
- [[Google]] (Axion)
- [[Samsung]], [[MediaTek]], etc.

---

## AI server expansion

**The growth story:**
- Mobile saturated — growth in servers/AI
- NVIDIA Grace CPU = Arm-based
- AWS Graviton = Arm-based
- Google Axion = Arm-based
- Data centers shifting from x86 ([[Intel]]/[[AMD]]) to Arm

**Why Arm for AI:**
- Better performance per watt
- Custom silicon flexibility
- Hyperscalers want alternatives to [[Intel]]

---

## PC transition

**Arm moving into laptops — historic x86 territory:**

| Player | Product | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| [[Apple]] | M-series (M1→M5) | Dominant in Mac, proved Arm viability |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Snapdragon X / X2 | Windows laptops, challenging [[Intel]]/[[AMD]] |
| [[Microsoft]] | Windows on Arm | OS support improving, translation layer for legacy apps |

**The challenge:** Software ecosystem. x86 has decades of Windows applications. Arm requires recompilation or translation (performance penalty).

**Apple's solution:** Rosetta 2 translation layer enabled smooth transition. Windows ecosystem following similar path.

**Why it matters:** If Arm succeeds in PCs, it opens massive new TAM beyond mobile.

## [[Automotive]] expansion

**EVs and autonomous driving = computing-intensive:**

| Application | Arm role |
|-------------|----------|
| Battery management | Efficient control systems |
| ADAS (driver assistance) | Real-time sensor processing |
| Infotainment | [[Dashboard]] displays, central computing |
| Autonomous driving | AI inference at the edge |

**Why Arm wins here:**
- Power efficiency critical (every watt matters for range)
- Real-time processing requirements
- Integration with sensor systems
- Automakers building custom SoCs on Arm

---

## [[Robotics]] expansion

**Emerging market for Arm:**

| Requirement | Arm advantage |
|-------------|---------------|
| Real-time control | Low-latency processing |
| Sensor fusion | Efficient multi-input handling |
| AI inference | On-device decision making |
| [[Power constraints]] | Battery-powered robots need efficiency |

**Applications:**
- Humanoid robots ([[Tesla Optimus]], [[Figure AI]], etc.)
- Industrial automation
- Warehouse robotics
- [[Drones]] and autonomous systems

**The opportunity:** Every robot needs a brain. Arm's efficiency-first design fits battery-powered, thermally-constrained robotics.

## Software ecosystem moat

**The real competitive advantage:**

Arm's technical architecture is only part of the moat. The deeper moat is software:

| Layer | Lock-in |
|-------|---------|
| Operating systems | iOS, Android built for Arm |
| Developer tools | Compilers, SDKs, debuggers |
| Application base | Billions of mobile apps |
| Talent pool | Engineers trained on Arm |

**Feedback loop:**
- More Arm devices → more developers → more software → more devices
- Switching cost increases with ecosystem size
- [[RISC-V]] must rebuild this from scratch

---

## [[SoftBank]] / Masa connection

**[[Masayoshi Son]]'s key asset:**
- [[SoftBank]] owns ~90%
- Acquired 2016 for $32B
- IPO'd Sept 2023 at ~$55B
- Now worth $150B+
- 54.6% of [[SoftBank]] NAV

**Risk:** Masa's margin call trigger at -40% Arm decline. See [[AI infrastructure financing risk]].

---

## NVIDIA relationship

**Grace CPU:**
- NVIDIA's Arm-based data center CPU
- Paired with GPUs in Grace Hopper
- Arm collects royalties
- NVIDIA tried to acquire Arm (2020) — blocked by regulators

**Irony:** NVIDIA acquisition blocked, now NVIDIA is major Arm customer.

---

## Competitive position

| Architecture | Strength | Arm threat |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **x86 ([[Intel]]/[[AMD]])** | Legacy, installed base | Arm taking server share |
| **[[RISC-V]]** | Open source, no royalties | Long-term IP threat |

**[[RISC-V]] risk:** Open-source alternative. [[China]] investing heavily. Could erode Arm's moat long-term.

---

## Geopolitics

**Export control implications:**
- Arm is [[UK]]-based (Cambridge)
- But US has influence (customers, [[SoftBank]])
- [[China]] licenses Arm — could be restricted
- Arm [[China]] JV is complicated (semi-independent)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Near-monopoly in mobile IP
- AI server expansion = new TAM
- Asset-light, high margin
- Every chip trend benefits Arm
- Hyperscaler custom silicon = Arm

**Bear:**
- Valuation extreme (~100x+ P/E)
- Mobile saturated
- [[RISC-V]] long-term threat
- [[SoftBank]] overhang (selling?)
- [[China]] risk
