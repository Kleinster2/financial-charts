**Arm Holdings** — Semiconductor IP company. Architecture in every smartphone, expanding to AI/servers. SoftBank's crown jewel.

---

## Why Arm matters

Arm doesn't make chips — it licenses the architecture that others use:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | Near-monopoly in mobile CPU IP |
| Chips shipped | 250B+ cumulative |
| Royalty model | Per-chip royalties + licensing fees |
| Owner | [[Masayoshi Son]] / SoftBank (~90%) |

---

## Business model

**IP licensing:**
- Arm designs CPU architectures
- Licenses to chip makers (Apple, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, etc.)
- Charges upfront license fee + per-chip royalty
- Asset-light, high margin

**Customers (everyone):**
- [[Apple]] (M-series, A-series)
- Qualcomm (Snapdragon)
- [[NVIDIA]] (Grace CPU)
- [[Amazon]] (Graviton)
- [[Google]] (Axion)
- [[Samsung]], MediaTek, etc.

---

## AI server expansion

**The growth story:**
- Mobile saturated — growth in servers/AI
- NVIDIA Grace CPU = Arm-based
- AWS Graviton = Arm-based
- Google Axion = Arm-based
- Data centers shifting from x86 (Intel/AMD) to Arm

**Why Arm for AI:**
- Better performance per watt
- Custom silicon flexibility
- Hyperscalers want alternatives to Intel

---

## SoftBank / Masa connection

**[[Masayoshi Son]]'s key asset:**
- SoftBank owns ~90%
- Acquired 2016 for $32B
- IPO'd Sept 2023 at ~$55B
- Now worth $150B+
- 54.6% of SoftBank NAV

**Risk:** Masa's margin call trigger at -40% Arm decline. See [[AI infrastructure financing risk]].

---

## NVIDIA relationship

**Grace CPU:**
- NVIDIA's Arm-based data center CPU
- Paired with GPUs in Grace Hopper
- Arm collects royalties
- NVIDIA tried to acquire Arm (2020) — blocked by regulators

**Irony:** NVIDIA acquisition blocked, now NVIDIA is major Arm customer.

---

## Competitive position

| Architecture | Strength | Arm threat |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **x86 (Intel/AMD)** | Legacy, installed base | Arm taking server share |
| **RISC-V** | Open source, no royalties | Long-term IP threat |

**RISC-V risk:** Open-source alternative. China investing heavily. Could erode Arm's moat long-term.

---

## Geopolitics

**Export control implications:**
- Arm is UK-based (Cambridge)
- But US has influence (customers, SoftBank)
- China licenses Arm — could be restricted
- Arm China JV is complicated (semi-independent)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Near-monopoly in mobile IP
- AI server expansion = new TAM
- Asset-light, high margin
- Every chip trend benefits Arm
- Hyperscaler custom silicon = Arm

**Bear:**
- Valuation extreme (~100x+ P/E)
- Mobile saturated
- RISC-V long-term threat
- SoftBank overhang (selling?)
- China risk
