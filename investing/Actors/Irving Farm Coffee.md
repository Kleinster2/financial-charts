## Sourcing

~75% of coffee purchased directly from farmers and cooperatives that Streetman has visited personally. 100% of coffee bought from producers they've met face-to-face. Geographic focus on Central/South America — Colombia, Brazil, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador.

Key relationships:

- Mendez family (El Salvador) — Fourth-generation producers Nena and Herman Mendez. Irving Farm has partnered with their farm for 12+ years. $1 from each Natamaya purchase supports education at origin; the family built a school in Portezuelo village in 2012. The Mendez family's daughter Amalia has worked as a barista at Irving Farm's 79th Street cafe.
- Las Capucas cooperative (Honduras) — Quality improvement program; Streetman grew purchases from 150 to 4,500 lbs annually by buying from top growers.

## Roasting

All coffee roasted at the Millerton, NY facility (Hudson Valley). Computerized roast logs connected via thermocouple wire create detailed profiles of every batch for replication. Philosophy leans toward lighter roasts that showcase bean terroir rather than masking it. Started roasting in ~1999 when roasting wasn't permitted in NYC proper.

## Wholesale & Partnerships

Wholesale partners include restaurants, boutique shops, hotels, and institutions. Notable early partners included City Bakery and Verbena. Current wholesale program offers full training, equipment consultation, menu development, and regular free quality-assessment visits.

Retail partnerships include [[Mast Brothers|Mast Market]] (curated organic/biodynamic selection) and distribution through Faire marketplace and Trade Coffee.

## Business Model

Private, bootstrapped company — no known external funding rounds. Revenue estimated at $12-15M annually across:

- Owned cafes (6 locations)
- Wholesale (restaurants, offices, institutions)
- E-commerce (Shopify-based DTC, subscriptions)
- Cold brew / packaged goods (RTD cans, retail bags)

The recent location closures suggest a tightening focus — cutting underperforming retail locations while maintaining the wholesale and DTC business. The company has not disclosed plans for franchising.

## Competitive Context

Irving Farm sits in NYC's crowded specialty coffee market alongside [[Stumptown Coffee|Stumptown]], [[Blue Bottle Coffee|Blue Bottle]] (acquired by [[Nestle]] 2017), [[La Colombe]], [[Intelligentsia Coffee|Intelligentsia]] (acquired by [[JDE Peet's|Peet's]]/[[JAB Holding]]), [[Joe Coffee]], and [[Devocion]]. Irving Farm's differentiator is its longevity (founded 1996, pre-dating most competitors), Hudson Valley roasting provenance, and deep direct-trade sourcing relationships.

Unlike Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, Irving Farm has remained independent — no PE or strategic acquirer. The trade-off is slower growth and recent contraction vs. the capital-fueled expansion of acquired peers.
