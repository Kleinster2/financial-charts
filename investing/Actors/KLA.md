# KLA (KLAC)

U.S. semiconductor equipment company specializing in process control — inspection and metrology.

---

## Core thesis

KLA benefits from increasing complexity and shrinking margins for error. At advanced nodes, defect detection becomes critical — one defect can kill an expensive chip. More complexity = more KLA tools.

---

## What they do

| Segment | Description | Position |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Inspection | Finds defects on wafers/masks | Dominant |
| Metrology | Measures film thickness, dimensions | Leading |
| Data analytics | Process control software | Growing |

They don't make chips — they make sure chips are made correctly.

---

## Why complexity helps KLA

| Node | Challenge | KLA benefit |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Smaller features | Harder to inspect | More sophisticated tools |
| More layers | More places for defects | More inspection steps |
| Higher ASPs | Cost of defects rises | More inspection justified |
| EUV | New defect types | New tool requirements |

As yields matter more, KLA matters more.

---

## Exposure

| End market | Exposure | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Logic/Foundry | ~65% | TSMC, Samsung, Intel |
| Memory | ~10% | Less inspection-intensive |
| Services | ~25% | Recurring, high-margin |

Logic-heavy because leading edge logic has tightest tolerances.

## Services business (hidden quality)

KLA's services are different from peers — cleaner, stickier:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue share | 25% |
| CAGR 2020-2025 | 13% |
| CY26 target | 12-14% growth |
| Installed base | 50,000 tools |
| Equipment life | High teens (was 12-13 yrs) |

**Why it's sticky:**
- Custom parts — customers can't self-service
- High complexity, low volume — KLA controls supply chain
- 75% is service contracts (not break/fix)
- Process control can't go offline — yield depends on it

**Unlike Lam/AMAT:**
- No mature node equipment mixed in
- Less consumable-intensive
- Pure service revenue

This is a recurring revenue annuity growing faster than equipment. ASPs up 150bps vs 2013 — pricing power.

New tailwinds: [[HBM]], advanced packaging driving service demand.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Applied Materials | Growing inspection business |
| Onto Innovation | Smaller, niche segments |
| Hitachi | [[Japan]], some overlap |

KLA dominates high-end inspection/metrology.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | KLAC (NASDAQ) |
| Segment | Inspection, metrology |
| Revenue | ~$10B (FY24) |
| Primary customers | TSMC, Samsung, Intel |
