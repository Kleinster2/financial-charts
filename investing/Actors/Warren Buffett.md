**Warren Buffett** — chairman and CEO of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] since 1965. Pioneered the [[Dual-class shares]] structure outside tech — Class A/B split enabled decades of reinvestment over dividends, compounding book value at ~20% annually for 50+ years.

## Performance and the alpha debate

[[Berkshire Hathaway]] generated ~20% annualized returns from 1965, roughly double the S&P 500 — but virtually all statistical alpha was concentrated pre-2000. From 1981–2002: +16.8% annual alpha vs Russell 1000 Value (t-stat 3.13). Post-2000: roughly market-matching or trailing.

The [[Buffett's Alpha]] paper (Frazzini, Kabiller & Pedersen) found that Buffett's returns decompose into: ~1.6x leverage via cheap insurance float + systematic tilts to low-beta, high-quality stocks. A synthetic portfolio replicating these factor exposures performed comparably to Berkshire. Buffett's skill was recognizing these premia decades before academia documented them.

[[Chamath Palihapitiya]] offered an alternative framing: [[Regulation Fair Disclosure]] (Oct 2000) eliminated the legal information advantages that pre-2000 investors enjoyed — private CFO calls, selective quarterly result sharing. The timing aligns, but structural factors (size, factor crowding, cash drag) likely matter more.

Buffett's own advocacy for index funds is consistent with both explanations — his edge was real but narrow, structural, and difficult to replicate without insurance float as a leverage source.
