## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | vs Doubao |
|------------|----------|-----------|

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Doubao is a ByteDance product (private).

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[NVIDIA]] — $14B GPU order
- [[SK Hynix]] — HBM for ByteDance infrastructure

**Thesis implications:**
- China AI usage consolidating around ByteDance
- Agentic commerce = real monetization path
- ByteDance AI spend benefits memory/GPU suppliers

---

## Open questions

- Can Doubao maintain lead as DeepSeek improves?
- Will agentic commerce drive meaningful revenue?
- How will export controls affect model quality vs US?
- Will Tencent's WeChat distribution catch up?
