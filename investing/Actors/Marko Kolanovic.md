## Career arc

- Academic background — PhD in theoretical [[physics]] (particle physics). Transitioned from academia to quantitative finance
- JPMorgan (2000s–July 2024) — Rose to chief global market strategist and co-head of global research. His team covered macro, derivatives, and quantitative equity strategies. Built systematic cross-asset portfolios for institutional clients
- Peak influence (2015–2022) — Earned "Gandalf" nickname from financial media (notably [[ZeroHedge]]) for eerily accurate calls on market turning points. Used quantitative flow analysis — tracking [[CTA]] positioning, [[volatility]] selling, options gamma — to predict short-term market moves
- Bearish turn & exit (2023–2024) — Turned bearish in late 2022/early 2023, predicting recession and [[S&P 500]] crash to 4,200 by end of 2024. The market instead rallied 25%+. Became the most bearish strategist at any major bank. Left JPMorgan in July 2024
- Post-JPMorgan (Aug 2024–present) — Briefly claimed vindication during August 2024 [[volatility]] spike. Active on social media with macro warnings. As of early 2025, warning about AI capex bubble and potential 50% drop in memory stocks

## Key theses & frameworks

### Quantitative flow analysis
Pioneered approach of tracking systematic fund positioning ([[CTA]]s, [[risk parity]], [[volatility]]-targeting funds) to predict short-term market moves. When these strategies were maximally short, he'd call bottoms; when maximally long, tops.

### Gamma & volatility mechanics
Analyzed [[options]] dealer [[gamma]] positioning to predict market behavior. Negative gamma = amplified moves; positive gamma = suppressed [[volatility]].

### Late-cycle bear thesis (2023–24)
Argued that [[Federal Reserve]] rate hikes would cause economic damage with a lag, that earnings estimates were too high, and that AI hype was masking fundamental deterioration. Maintained S&P 500 year-end target of 4,200 — lowest on Wall Street — while index traded above 5,000.

## Track record

### Hits ✅
- Feb 2018 Volmageddon — Called the bottom during the [[VIX]] spike that blew up XIV. Market recovered as he predicted
- Dec 2018 selloff — Correctly predicted the sharp bounce after the Christmas Eve low
- COVID crash recovery (2020) — Called for aggressive buying during March 2020 meltdown, citing extreme systematic fund de-risking
- 2020–2021 value rotation — Predicted rotation from growth to value, which partially played out

### Misses ❌
- 2022 bullish call — Predicted market rally in 2022 when stocks ultimately fell ~20% due to [[Federal Reserve]] rate hikes
- 2023–2024 bearish stance — The defining miss. Stayed bearish through one of the strongest rallies in decades. S&P 500 gained ~45% from Oct 2022 lows while he predicted crash
- Recession call — Predicted US recession that never materialized as labor market stayed resilient
- AI dismissal — Underestimated the earnings impact of [[AI]] spending on [[Magnificent Seven]] stocks
