## Business

RA&A has organized the FII summit since 2017, attracting CEOs from [[Citigroup]], [[BlackRock]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and other major institutions. The event is the PIF's flagship convening platform — part diplomacy, part dealflow.

Beyond FII, RA&A runs events and advisory work across its six offices, though FII is the franchise asset.

## IPO

- Jul 2025: Attias confirmed IPO plans for 2026, working with [[Evercore]]
- Feb 2026: Bloomberg reported banks selected, deal could come this year
- Valuation target ~$1B
- Listing venue not yet disclosed (likely [[Tadawul]] given PIF ownership, but could be dual-listed)

Key question: Is this a one-event company or a scalable platform? The ~75% PIF ownership means the IPO is partly a Saudi capital markets development play (more listings on Tadawul) rather than pure fundraising.
