**Energy Fuels** — US uranium miner with rare earth processing. White Mesa Mill is one of few Western facilities for heavy REE separation. Dual exposure to nuclear renaissance and critical minerals.

## Why Energy Fuels matters

Unique positioning across two critical supply chains:

| Business | Asset | Strategic value |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| [[Uranium]] | White Mesa Mill, multiple mines | US domestic supply |
| Rare earths | White Mesa separation circuit | Heavy REE processing (Dy/Tb) |

**The differentiator**: White Mesa can process heavy rare earths — [[Dysprosium]], [[Terbium]] — that [[MP Materials]] cannot. This is the capability gap REAlloys is also targeting.

## [[Uranium]] operations

| Asset | Location | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| White Mesa Mill | Utah | Operating (only conventional U mill in US) |
| Pinyon Plain | Arizona | Permitted, high-grade |
| La Sal Complex | Utah | Standby |
| Nichols Ranch | Wyoming | ISR, standby |

**Strategic value**: Only conventional uranium mill operating in the United States.

## Rare earth operations

Energy Fuels is building rare earth separation capacity at White Mesa:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Monazite processing | Operating |
| Light REE separation | Operating |
| Heavy REE separation | Ramping |
| Nd/Pr oxide production | Commercial |

**Heavy REE angle**: White Mesa can separate [[Dysprosium]] and [[Terbium]] — the elements critical for EV magnets and [[ASML]] High-NA EUV stages. Few Western facilities can do this.

## Competitive positioning

### vs [[Uranium]] peers

| vs Competitor | Energy Fuels position |
|---------------|----------------------|
| [[Uranium Energy Corp]] | Both US-based; UUUU has mill, UEC has ISR |
| [[Cameco]] | Much smaller but US-domestic |
| [[Kazatomprom]] | Higher cost but no geopolitics |

### vs Rare earth peers

| vs Competitor | Energy Fuels position |
|---------------|----------------------|
| [[MP Materials]] | MP is light REE; UUUU does heavy REE |
| Lynas | Both Western, complementary |
| REAlloys | Similar heavy REE focus |

**Unique position**: No other US company has both uranium production AND heavy rare earth separation.

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Dual nuclear + REE exposure
- Only US conventional uranium mill
- Heavy REE separation (Dy/Tb) — rare capability
- Beneficiary of both [[Nuclear power for AI]] and [[Rare earth leverage]]
- US energy security play

**Bear:**
- Small vs global miners
- [[Uranium]] price sensitive
- REE business still ramping
- Execution risk on dual strategy

**Catalyst**: REE separation reaching commercial scale while uranium demand accelerates for AI data centers.
