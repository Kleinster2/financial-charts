## Why Cyberdyne matters

Cyberdyne represents the **intersection of BCI and rehabilitation robotics** — HAL reads brain signals through skin surface to detect motor intent, then moves the exoskeleton *before* the patient's muscles fully engage. This is a practical BCI application already in clinical and commercial use.

**Global reach:** Japan, US, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific.

## HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb)

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **HAL Medical (Lower Limb)** | Stroke, spinal cord injury rehabilitation |
| **HAL Medical (Single Joint)** | Targeted joint therapy |
| **HAL Lumbar** | Industrial — reduces back strain for workers |
| **HAL for Welfare** | Independence support, elderly care |

### How HAL works

1. **Detect:** Sensors on skin read bioelectrical signals (faint signals the brain sends to muscles)
2. **Process:** Onboard computer interprets intended movement
3. **Assist:** Exoskeleton moves in sync with — or slightly ahead of — patient's effort
4. **Learn:** Repeated assisted movement helps brain "re-learn" motor patterns (neuroplasticity)

**Key differentiator:** Unlike passive exoskeletons, HAL uses brain-muscle signal feedback loop — a form of practical [[Brain-computer interface|BCI]].

## Financials

| FY (Mar) | Revenue | YoY |
|----------|---------|-----|
| FY2025 | ¥4.38B (~$29M) | +0.7% |
| FY2024 | ¥4.35B | — |
| Q2 FY2026 | ¥963M | -2.5% |

**Margins:** Still operating at loss; R&D-heavy. Revenue growth modest.

**Next earnings:** February 12, 2026.

## Regulatory status

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[Japan]] | Approved, in clinical use |
| [[EU]] | CE marked |
| [[US]] | FDA cleared (2017, 510(k)) |

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Cyberdyne advantage | Cyberdyne weakness |
|----|---------------------|-------------------|
| [[Fourier Intelligence]] | Brain-signal feedback, regulatory clearance | Higher cost, slower growth |
| Ekso Bionics | More clinical evidence | Similar market position |
| ReWalk (Lifeward) | Japanese market strength | ReWalk has home-use clearance |

**Moat:** HAL's brain-signal detection is proprietary; most competitors use pre-programmed patterns or EMG only.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Unique brain-signal technology
- Aging [[Japan]] population drives demand
- Multi-region regulatory approvals
- Government support for robotics in Japan
- Industrial HAL expands TAM beyond medical

**Bear:**
- Tiny revenue (~$29M) for public company
- Still not profitable
- Slow growth
- Limited awareness outside Japan
- Competition intensifying (China, US)
