## Autonomous vehicle strategy

Partnerships over ownership:

| Partner | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Waymo]] | Robotaxi deployment (US) |
| [[WeRide]] | Robotaxi (Middle East — 1,200 vehicles by ~2027) |

Uber exited AV development (sold ATG to Aurora) but partners with leaders.

## Robotaxi charging infrastructure (Feb 18, 2026)

$100M+ investment in EV charging for autonomous fleets:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | >$100M |
| Chargers | ~1,000 new chargers globally |
| Initial US cities | Bay Area, LA, Dallas |
| Charging type | DC fast charging at autonomous depots + pit stops |
| AV city target | 10+ cities by end of 2026 |

Charging partnerships:

| Partner | Markets |
|---------|---------|
| [[EVgo]] | New York, LA, San Francisco, Boston |
| Electra | Paris, Madrid |
| Hubber | London |
| [[Ionity]] | London |

Strategy: Hybrid platform — human drivers and robotaxi partners on same network. Both need charging. Building infrastructure makes Uber essential to AV operators, not just a demand aggregator.

Uber currently offers robotaxis in 4 US cities plus Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh. Has invested hundreds of millions in AV companies: [[Lucid]], Nuro, Wayve, Moove, Avomo. Stock +2.9% on announcement but -14% YTD — market still skeptical on AV strategy.

## Waymo partnership

Robotaxi on Uber platform:
- Waymo vehicles bookable via Uber app
- Phoenix deployment (2023)
- Expanding to more cities
- Uber provides demand, Waymo provides AVs

[[Network effects]]: largest rider base makes Uber preferred AV partner.

## Competitive position

|------------|--------|
| [[Lyft]] | US rideshare \#2 |
| [[DoorDash]] | US delivery \#1 |
| Didi | [[China]] (exited) |

Uber is the only global scale player.
