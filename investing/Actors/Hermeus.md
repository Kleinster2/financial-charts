## Programs

### Quarterhorse (test platform)

Iterative development toward Mach 5:

| Variant | Status | Target speed |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Mk 0 | Complete | Non-flying (subsystem validation) |
| Mk 1 | First flight May 2025, Edwards AFB | Subsonic |
| Mk 2 | Mk 2.1 at Spaceport America | Mach 2.5+ |
| Mk 3 | In development | Mach 3.3+ |
| Final | Target 2026 | Mach 5 |

### Darkhorse (production)

Uncrewed hypersonic military jet designed for mass production. Multi-mission reusable UAS for defense and national security. Powered by Chimera II engine (tested on Quarterhorse Mk 3 first, then mass-produced for Darkhorse). Targeting USAF arsenal within the decade.

---

## Propulsion: Chimera engine

Turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) -- hybrid turbojet/ramjet. Pre-cooled turbine transitions to ramjet at high Mach. Enables takeoff from runway, acceleration through sound barrier, and cruise at Mach 5+. No rocket boost needed.

## Defense contracts

| Contract | Year | Value | Description |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| USAF initial | 2020 | $1.5M | Aircraft development (potential Air Force One application) |
| USAF STRATFI | 2021 | $60M | 3-year: build/test 3 Quarterhorse aircraft + propulsion |
| DIU HyCAT | 2023 | $23M/yr | Multi-year hypersonic capability demonstration |
| SBIR Phase II | Ongoing | -- | Hypersonic analysis for OUSD R&E, AFRL, PACAF |

---

## Project Ranger

Groundbreaking on 1,000-acre hypersonic manufacturing campus in New Mexico. Intended for Darkhorse mass production.

## Investment case

Bull:
- First-mover in reusable hypersonic aircraft
- Strong DoD demand post-Ukraine (hypersonic defense priority)
- Iterative flight-test approach de-risks development
- [[Sam Altman]], [[Founders Fund]], [[In-Q-Tel]] backing
- Quarterhorse Mk 1 successful first flight (May 2025)

Bear:
- Pre-revenue, capital-intensive
- Hypersonic is technically extremely difficult
- Long timeline to production Darkhorse
- Competing with established primes ([[Lockheed Martin]], [[Raytheon]])
