## Programs

### Quarterhorse (test platform)

Iterative development toward Mach 5:

| Variant | Status | Target speed |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Mk 0 | Complete | Non-flying (subsystem validation) |
| Mk 1 | First flight May 2025, Edwards AFB | Subsonic |
| Mk 2 | Mk 2.1 at Spaceport America | Mach 2.5+ |
| Mk 3 | In development | Mach 3.3+ |
| Final | Target 2026 | Mach 5 |

### Darkhorse (military UAS)

Uncrewed hypersonic military jet designed for mass production. Multi-mission reusable UAS for ISR and strike in contested environments. 1,000+ lb payload. Powered by Chimera II engine (tested on Quarterhorse Mk 3 first, then mass-produced for Darkhorse). Target first flight ~2027. Targeting USAF arsenal within the decade.

### Halcyon (commercial passenger -- aspirational)

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Speed | Mach 5 (~3,300 mph) |
| Passengers | ~20 |
| Range | 4,600 miles (125+ routes) |
| NYC-London | ~90 minutes |
| Altitude | 100,000+ feet |
| Target price | Business class fares |
| First test flight | ~2029 (aspirational) |

Analyst skepticism: Richard Aboulafia estimated odds in the "1% range" of achieving hypersonic transport at business class prices by late 2030s.

## Propulsion: Chimera engine

Turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) -- hybrid turbojet/ramjet. Pre-cooled turbine transitions to ramjet at high Mach. Enables takeoff from runway, acceleration through sound barrier, and cruise at Mach 5+. No rocket boost needed.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Development | Built in 21 months for $18M |
| 3D printing | 15% of engine is additively manufactured |
| Key milestone | Nov 2022: turbojet-to-ramjet mode transition demonstrated at Notre Dame Turbomachinery Lab (simulated up to Mach 4) |
| Precooler | Proprietary tech lowering inlet air temp, extending turbine operating range |

First commercially-developed TBCC engine. Uses off-the-shelf gas turbine cores (saves billions vs clean-sheet).

## Facilities

| Location | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Atlanta, GA | HQ, manufacturing, Mk 2 assembly | Operational |
| Cecil Airport, Jacksonville, FL | HEAT facility (engine testing) | $135M investment, 100+ jobs. Sea-level static tests started late 2024. Weekly flight-test cadence expected 2026 |
| Spaceport America, NM | Mk 2.1 flight testing | Mk 2.1 arrived Jan 2026 |
| Edwards AFB, CA | Mk 1 flight testing | Completed May 2025 |
| Project Ranger, NM | 1,000-acre hypersonic manufacturing campus | Groundbreaking. Intended for Darkhorse mass production |

## Investment case

Bull:
- First-mover in reusable hypersonic aircraft
- Strong DoD demand post-Ukraine (hypersonic defense priority)
- Iterative flight-test approach de-risks development
- [[Sam Altman]], [[Founders Fund]], [[In-Q-Tel]] backing
- Quarterhorse Mk 1 successful first flight (May 2025)

Bear:
- Pre-revenue, capital-intensive
- Hypersonic is technically extremely difficult
- Long timeline to production Darkhorse
- Competing with established primes ([[Lockheed Martin]], [[Raytheon]])
