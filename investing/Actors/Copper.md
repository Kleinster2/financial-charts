**Copper** — Industrial metal and economic bellwether. "Dr. Copper" for macro signaling. At record highs (Jan 2026) on supply disruptions and tariff stockpiling.

---

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price | Record high (Jan 2026) |
| Driver | Supply disruptions, tariff stockpiling |
| Demand | AI data centers, EVs, grid |
| Sentiment | Bullish on electrification |

Hit record alongside gold and silver — geopolitical tension driving commodity flows.

## Price drivers

| Driver | Current status | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **AI/Data centers** | Massive copper demand | Structural bullish |
| **EVs** | 3-4x copper vs ICE cars | Structural bullish |
| **Grid buildout** | Electrification trend | Bullish |
| **Supply disruptions** | Mine issues ([[Chile]], Peru) | Bullish |
| **Tariff stockpiling** | US hoarding pre-tariffs | Short-term bullish |
| **[[China]] demand** | Property weak, but infra strong | Mixed |

## Why "Dr. Copper"

**Economic indicator:**
- Used in construction, manufacturing, electronics
- Demand tracks global economic activity
- Rising copper = economic expansion signal
- Falling copper = recession warning

But 2026 rally driven more by supply + AI than traditional macro.

---

## AI infrastructure demand

**Copper in data centers:**

| Component | Copper use |
|-----------|------------|
| Power cables | High |
| Busbars | High |
| Transformers | High |
| Cooling systems | Moderate |
| Server interconnects | Moderate |

**Estimate:** Single hyperscale DC = 20,000-40,000 tonnes copper.

AI buildout = structural copper demand.

---

## EV demand

**Copper per vehicle:**

| Vehicle type | Copper (lbs) |
|--------------|--------------|
| ICE car | ~50 |
| Hybrid | ~85 |
| BEV | **180+** |

[[EV transition]] = 3-4x copper intensity.

---

## Supply challenges

**Structural constraints:**
- Major mines aging ([[Chile]], Peru)
- New mine development slow (10+ year lead time)
- Grade decline at existing mines
- Water scarcity in key regions
- Permitting difficulties

**Key producers:**
- [[Chile]] (~25% global)
- Peru (~10%)
- DRC (~10%)
- [[China]] (~8%)

---

## Tariff/stockpiling dynamics

**US hoarding (Jan 2026):**
- Fears of import tariffs on metals
- Copper held in US warehouses
- Global supply tightening
- Similar to silver dynamics

## Investment vehicles

| Vehicle | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Copper futures | HG | CME contract |
| Global X Copper Miners | COPX | Miner ETF |
| [[Southern Copper]] | SCCO | Largest public copper miner |
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | FCX | Major copper/gold producer |
| United States Copper Index | CPER | Physical-backed ETF |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI/DC demand structural
- [[EV transition]] accelerating
- Supply constrained (long lead times)
- Grid buildout global
- Electrification megatrend

**Bear:**
- [[China]] property weakness
- Recession risk
- Substitution (aluminum)
- New supply eventually comes
- Already at record prices
