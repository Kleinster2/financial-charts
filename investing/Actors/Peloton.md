## Strategic pivot

**Old model:** Hardware growth at any cost — sell bikes, worry about profits later.

**New model (Peter Stern):**
- High-margin recurring revenue platform
- AI-driven personalized training
- Precor commercial equipment
- Cost discipline
- Not chasing subscriber growth

| Revenue | $2.4-2.5B (-2% YoY at midpoint) |
| Free cash flow | ≥$200M |
| Tariff impact | ~$65M headwind |

Continued revenue decline expected as hardware sales shrink.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- EBITDA turnaround real ($0 → $400M+)
- First GAAP profits in history
- 2.8M sticky subscribers = recurring revenue
- Trading at 1.1x sales — historically cheap
- New CEO from Apple brings credibility
- Content library is defensible moat

**Bear:**
- Subscribers still declining
- Hardware is melting ice cube
- Competition from Apple Fitness+, Lululemon Mirror (discontinued), gym reopenings
- Stock -29% in 2025 despite profit improvement
- "High-risk turnaround" per analysts
- Brand damaged from recalls, layoffs
