**NAURA Technology** (SZSE: 002371) — China's largest semiconductor equipment maker. "National champion" status with a geopolitical moat: direct beneficiary of China's fab self-sufficiency push. Platform player across etch, deposition, thermal, and cleaning tools, increasingly viable at sub-14nm nodes.

## Business segments

| Segment | H1 2025 share | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Semiconductor equipment** | >80% | Etch, PVD/CVD deposition, furnaces, cleaning, annealing |
| Vacuum technology | ~20% combined | Industrial furnaces, crystal growth, aerospace |
| Lithium battery equipment | | EV cell manufacturing lines |
| Precision components | | Resistors, capacitors, crystal oscillators |

### Semiconductor equipment breakdown (H1 2025 estimates)

| Category | Revenue | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Deposition (PVD/CVD) | ~¥6.5B | Largest category |
| Etch | ~¥5B | |
| Thermal processing | ~¥1B | Oxidation/diffusion furnaces |
| Cleaning | ~¥0.5B | |

These four categories = >80% of total sales (up from ~70% a year prior), reflecting an increasingly semiconductor-focused mix.

## Competitive position

**China's answer to [[Applied Materials]], [[Lam Research]], and [[Tokyo Electron]]** — but focused on mature nodes (28nm+) with growing capability at sub-14nm.

Key customers: [[SMIC]], HuaHong, and other Chinese foundries ramping capacity for auto, AI, and consumer chips.

**~30 tool product arsenal** — one of few Chinese equipment companies with breadth across multiple process steps. Most domestic competitors are single-tool specialists.

---

## Growth drivers

1. **China fab buildout** — dozens of new fabs + upgrades, driven by self-sufficiency mandate
2. **US export controls** — [[ASML]], [[Lam Research]], [[Applied Materials]] restricted from selling advanced tools to China → domestic substitution tailwind
3. **Tool qualification wins** — increasingly viable at 14nm and below
4. **Adjacent markets** — vacuum/battery/components provide revenue buffer during semi downturns

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- State-backed national champion with policy protection
- Only domestic player with multi-tool platform breadth
- China fab capex cycle has years to run
- R&D intensity few Western peers can match
- Geopolitical moat: US restrictions lock in domestic demand

**Bear:**
- Gross margin pressure from mix shift (lower-margin components)
- Valuation premium vs peers
- Technology gap vs [[ASML]]/[[Applied Materials]]/[[Lam Research]] at leading edge
- Geopolitical coin-flip: if US-China tensions ease, the "moat" shrinks
- Concentrated customer base (Chinese state-linked fabs)

**Contrarian signal:** Stock dropped ~6% on Aug 28, 2025 earnings day despite record results. Market focused on margin compression narrative while missing 50% YoY surge in core semi equipment revenue.

## Evolution

- Founded as Beijing NAURA Microelectronics Equipment (state-backed)
- Grew through consolidation of domestic semi equipment capabilities
- Became platform player through organic R&D + strategic acquisitions
- [[China]] designated as national champion for semiconductor equipment self-sufficiency
- Beneficiary of every round of US export controls tightening
