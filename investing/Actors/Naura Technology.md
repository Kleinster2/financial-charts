## Why Naura matters

Naura is China's answer to Applied Materials/Lam Research — and now has a captive market:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Products | Etch, deposition, cleaning, furnaces |
| Position | Largest domestic WFE |
| H1 2025 revenue | 16B yuan (+30% YoY) |
| Patents filed 2025 | 779 (2x vs 2020-21) |

## 50% domestic mandate beneficiary

**Before (pre-2023):**
- Chinese fabs preferred US/Japanese equipment
- Naura struggled to win business
- Quality/reliability gap vs Western tools

**After (2023+ export controls + 2025 mandate):**
- Chinese fabs have no choice
- 50% minimum domestic equipment required
- Naura is primary beneficiary

> "Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance."

## Product portfolio

| Segment | Products | Competition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Etch | Plasma etch | [[Lam Research]], [[AMEC]] |
| Deposition | CVD, PVD | [[Applied Materials]] |
| Cleaning | Wet clean | Screen, DNS |
| Thermal | Furnaces | Kokusai |

**Capability level:** Mature nodes (28nm+). Advanced nodes still challenging.

## Self-sufficiency progress

| Segment | China self-sufficiency |
|---------|------------------------|
| Cleaning/strip | ~50% |
| Etch | Growing (Naura + AMEC) |
| Deposition | Growing |
| Lithography | Major gap (no EUV) |
