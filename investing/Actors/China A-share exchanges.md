**Practical impact:** Investor with ¥1M capital could previously buy ¥2.25M in stock; now limited to ¥2M.

### Aug 2023 margin easing

Margin ratio lowered to 80% to support volumes during property crisis.

## Pattern

Beijing tolerates equity rallies but moves quickly to curb leverage when froth appears. Not a free market — active management of speculation levels. Easing during crises, tightening during euphoria.
