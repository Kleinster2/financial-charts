**United States Oil Fund** — tracks WTI crude oil front-month futures. Not a perfect oil tracker due to contango roll costs.

## Caveats

USO rolls front-month futures monthly. In contango (normal), this creates drag — USO underperforms spot oil over time. Not a long-term hold for oil exposure; better for short-term directional trades.

## Use Case

[[Oil]] proxy in the dashboard. USO vs [[UNG]] vs [[UGA]] shows energy commodities relative performance.
