**Solarstic** — Hyundai Motor Group venture developing vehicle-integrated solar technology. CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree.

---

## Why Solarstic matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Hyundai]] (ZERO1NE innovation program) |
| Status | Private, in-house venture |
| Technology | Injection-molded vehicle solar modules |
| Timeline | 1-2 years to launch |

---

## Technology

### Innovation

Replaces glass-based solar panels with **polymer packaging** — lighter, flexible, allows solar modules to function as structural exterior parts.

| Factor | Traditional | Solarstic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Material | Glass | Polymer |
| Weight | Heavy | Light |
| Design flexibility | Limited | High |
| Integration | Add-on | Structural |

### Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Power output | Up to 500W (hood + bonnet + roof) |
| Range extension | ~50 miles/day |
| Battery recharge | ~30% while driving |
| Use case | Short-distance: may not need charging; Long-distance: supplemental |

### Validated platforms

- Hyundai IONIQ 5
- Hyundai ST1 (electric)

## CES 2026

**Award:** CES Innovation Awards Honoree — Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility category

**Product:** Injection-Molded Vehicle Solar Module

**Exhibiting:** Eureka Park, Hyundai Motor Group ZERO1NE Pavilion

---

## Engineering challenges

| Challenge | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Manufacturing | Injection molding pressure vs fragile cells — developed low-pressure tech + protective layer |
| Durability | Anti-yellowing, anti-scratch coatings in testing |
| Aesthetics | Black finish hides cells unless close inspection |
| Safety | Polymer softer than glass — safer on pedestrian impact |

---

## Investment relevance

**Not directly investable** (private venture). Exposure via [[Hyundai]] (HYMTF).

**Thesis:** If technology scales, could differentiate Hyundai EVs and reduce charging infrastructure dependency.

**Competition:** [[Toyota]] solar roof (Prius), Lightyear (bankrupt), Aptera (pre-production).
