## Investment banking

Traditional profit engine — but volatility-dependent:

| Metric | Q1 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| IB income | £3.87B (+16% YoY) |
| Return on equity | **16%** (vs 12% target) |
| Cost/income | **54%** (vs "high 50s" target) |
| Global Markets share | ~64% of IB revenue |
| US share of IB fees | ~70% |

Tariff-driven volatility in 2025 boosted trading revenues beyond plan.
