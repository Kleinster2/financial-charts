## Why Inditex wins

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Speed** | 2-week design-to-store cycle (vs 6-12 months industry) |
| **Integrated model** | In-house design, production, logistics |
| **Proximity sourcing** | ~60% from Spain/Portugal/Morocco/Turkey |
| **Small batches** | Minimal markdowns, rapid iteration |
| **Store as data** | Real-time sales data drives production |
| **Capital discipline** | Fewer stores (+5% space), more productivity |
| **Ortega control** | ~60% ownership = long-term thinking |

**The key insight:** Inditex doesn't compete on price (gross margin 58% vs. H&M ~50%). It competes on **speed and relevance** — getting trends to market faster than anyone.

## Logistics investment

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Extraordinary capex | €900M/year (2024-2025) |
| Focus | Automated distribution centers |
| Regular capex | €1.8B (FY25) |
| [[Space]] growth target | ~5% annually |
| Online fulfillment | Integrated with stores |

## Competitive positioning

| Factor | Inditex/Zara | [[Shein]] | H&M |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Revenue | €38.6B | ~$30B GMV | €24B |
| Gross margin | 57.8% | Lower | ~50% |
| Model | Speed + quality | Ultra-price + AI | Speed + volume |
| Production | Near-shore ([[Europe]]) | [[China]] | Offshore ([[Asia]]) |
| Stores | 5,563 | None (DTC online) | 4,000+ |
| Customer | 25-45 | Gen Z, price-sensitive | Mass market |

**vs. Shein:** Different customer, different model. Inditex has higher prices, better quality, physical stores. Shein disrupts the low end but doesn't directly compete with Zara's core customer.

## Current challenges

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **FX headwinds** | -4% from weak USD/EM currencies |
| **Slowdown** | H1 2025 at +5% CC vs double-digit prior |
| **Feb-Mar 2025 start** | Only +4% (vs analyst expectations of +7-8%) |
| **Tariff risk** | Limited (mostly [[Europe]]-sourced), but indirect impact |
| **Succession** | Ortega (88) — daughter Marta Ortega chairs, but execution? |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Best-in-class fast fashion model (speed + margin)
- 58% gross margin = luxury-like economics

**Bear:**
