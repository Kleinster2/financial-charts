## Scandals and controversies

### Wirecard (Germany, 2016-2020)

**The defining scandal.** EY audited German fintech [[Wirecard]] for nearly a decade, issuing clean opinions even as €1.9B in reported cash did not exist.

**Key failures:**
- Relied on screenshots and Wirecard-provided documents to verify €1.9B in Singapore bank balances
- Failed to confirm bank balances directly — "day-one training at audit school"
- Internal whistleblower raised fraud allegations in 2016; investigation shut down at Wirecard management's request

**Consequences:**
- **Banned** from auditing public interest companies in Germany for 2 years (2023-2025)
- Fined €544k by German regulator APAS
- Facing €1.5B+ lawsuit from Wirecard's insolvency administrator
- €700M+ lawsuit from former shareholders
- Lost significant German blue-chip market share

German regulator concluded EY's audit opinions were "objectively inaccurate" with "grave failure" in quality controls. EY dropped its appeal in 2024, accepting sanctions to "bring a conclusion."

## Workforce dynamics

**First headcount reduction in 14 years** — FY2024 saw 2,400+ employee reduction, with practice support and strategy/transactions taking steepest cuts.

Graduate openings fell 44% YoY in 2024 across Big Four; reflecting AI automation and slower consulting growth.
