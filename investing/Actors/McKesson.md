## Why McKesson matters

**Drug distribution oligopoly.** McKesson, [[Cencora]], and [[Cardinal Health]] together supply >90% of the US pharmaceutical distribution market. This concentration provides pricing power and stable margins on a low-margin, high-volume business.

**Oncology/specialty focus.** McKesson has leaned into specialty drug distribution — particularly oncology — where margins are higher and growth faster than traditional retail pharmacy fulfillment.

| Period | Revenue | Growth |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Q1 FY26 | $97.8B | +23% |
| Q2 FY26 | $103.2B | +10% |

Growth driven by retail national account volumes and specialty/oncology distribution.

**FY26 guidance:** EPS $37.10-$37.90 (+12-15% YoY).

---

## Medical-Surgical separation

McKesson announced intent to separate its Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The separation would create two focused companies:
1. **McKesson** — pure-play pharmaceutical distribution
2. **NewCo** — medical-surgical supplies

Expected to maximize shareholder value through strategic clarity.

## Recent M&A

**PRISM Vision Holdings** — Acquired 80% controlling interest (April 2025). General ophthalmology and retina management services. Part of specialty health services strategy.

---

## Business model

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross margin | ~3% |
| Operating margin | ~1.5% |
| Inventory turns | ~12x |

Ultra-thin margins but massive volumes. Cash flow driven by favorable payment terms (buy drugs, get paid by pharmacies faster than McKesson pays manufacturers).

---

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Oligopoly position provides pricing stability
- Specialty/oncology higher-margin growth
- Medical-surgical separation unlocks value
- Strong free cash flow generation

**Bear case:**
- Amazon pharmacy threat (though limited so far)
- PBM vertical integration pressure
- Opioid litigation overhang (though largely settled)
- Razor-thin margins leave no room for error
