Qatar — World's largest [[LNG]] exporter, per-capita richest nation, [[GCC]]'s diplomatic linchpin. Population 3.1M (91% expatriate). Punches far above its weight through gas wealth, [[QIA]] sovereign capital, and mediator diplomacy.

## Economy — LNG is everything

Hydrocarbons = ~83% of government revenue, ~37% of GDP. The North Field (shared with [[Iran]]'s South Pars) holds 900+ trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas — world's largest non-associated gas field.

LNG expansion — the core story:

| Phase | Capacity | Timeline | Investment |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Current | 77 mtpa | Operating | — |
| North Field East (NFE) | → 110 mtpa | Mid-2026 | Part of $80B+ |
| North Field South (NFS) | Additional trains | 2027 | Part of $80B+ |
| North Field West (NFW) | → 142 mtpa | Before 2030 | $17B EPC contracts |

Nearly doubling output to 142 mtpa by 2030. [[QatarEnergy]] (state-owned) manages all upstream. Qatar will likely reclaim #1 global LNG exporter from the US.

Diversification: National Vision 2030 targets 3.4% CAGR non-hydrocarbon GDP, $100B FDI by 2030. Non-hydrocarbon already ~63% of GDP. Focus: manufacturing, tourism, logistics, fintech.

## Qatar Investment Authority

[[QIA]] — sovereign wealth fund, ~$524B AUM. Global SWF rank ~11th. QIA owns 50% of [[QNB]], stakes in [[Volkswagen]] (~17%), [[Glencore]] (~8.5%), [[Barclays]] (~6%), [[Deutsche Bank]] (~6%), [[Shell]] (~2%), [[Rosneft]] (9.75%), plus 100% of Harrods, 20% of Heathrow, [[Paris Saint-Germain]] (via QSI).

2025-2026 AI/tech pivot:

| Deal | Amount |
|------|--------|
| [[Brookfield]] AI infrastructure JV | $20B (Dec 2025) |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] MoU | $25B target (Jan 2026) |
| [[xAI]] Series E | Part of $20B round |
| [[Anthropic]] Series F + G | Participated |
| [[PsiQuantum]] | Part of $1B round |
| Positron (AI chips) | Part of $230M round (Feb 2026) |
| $500B US investment pledge | 10-year commitment (May 2025) |

The $500B US pledge drew skepticism — Global SWF's Diego Lopez called it "unrealistic" given total AUM of ~$524B.

## Geopolitics

Al Udeid Air Base: Hosts ~10,000 US troops, forward HQ for US Central Command. In June 2025, [[Iran]] struck Al Udeid with ~10 ballistic missiles — raised fundamental questions about whether the base protects Qatar or makes it a target.

2017 GCC blockade: [[Saudi Arabia]], [[UAE]], Bahrain, Egypt severed ties (June 2017). Accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and Iran ties. 13 demands including shutting [[Al Jazeera]] and closing Turkish base. Qatar refused all. Resolved at Al-Ula Summit (Jan 2021) — no concessions required.

Mediator role: Qatar's core diplomatic asset. Brokered Hamas-[[Israel]] ceasefire (Jan 2025) and second Gaza peace agreement (Oct 2025). Hosted Taliban negotiations leading to 2021 US withdrawal. Emir Tamim was first head of state to visit post-Assad Damascus (Jan 2025).

Iran triangulation: Shares the North Field/South Pars gas field with Iran. Maintains working relations with Tehran while hosting US military. This balancing act is Qatar's defining foreign policy challenge.

| LNG price sensitivity | 83% of govt revenue from hydrocarbons — North Field expansion may oversupply |
| Concentration risk | Single gas field provides the vast majority of revenue |
| Labor dependency | 91% expatriate population, kafala reform enforcement weak |
| Geopolitical exposure | Al Udeid makes Qatar a military target (June 2025 strike) |
| Regional rivalry | Smaller economy/SWF than [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[UAE]] |
