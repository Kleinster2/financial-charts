**Bitdeer** — ASIC-focused miner. -50% YTD. Lagging AI pivot. Custom chip development.

---

## Why Bitdeer matters (as cautionary tale)

Worst performer among major miners:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | BTDR |
| 2025 YTD | -50% |
| Strategy | ASIC chip development |
| AI pivot | Lagging |

---

## ASIC focus

**Custom chip strategy:**
- Developing own mining ASICs
- Chip delays hurt performance
- Different from GPU/AI pivot
- Bitmain relationship

---

## Underperformance

**Worst in class:**

| Company | 2025 YTD | Strategy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [[IREN]] | +300% | AI Microsoft |
| [[Hut 8]] | +139% | AI Google |
| [[Marathon]] | Lagging | BTC pure |
| **Bitdeer** | -50% | ASIC focus |

ASIC strategy not rewarded by market.

---

## Why lagging

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| ASIC delays | Missed timelines |
| No AI anchor | No hyperscaler deal |
| Q3 loss | Earnings miss |
| Bitmain ASIC price cuts | Margin pressure |

---

## AI services (limited)

**Some AI exposure:**
- AI cloud on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD
- Near-full utilization reported
- But small vs peers

Not enough to offset mining challenges.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- ASIC development optionality
- AI services growing
- Depressed valuation
- Turnaround potential

**Bear:**
- -50% for a reason
- ASIC strategy not working
- Peers far ahead on AI
- Execution issues
- No major AI deal

---

## Lesson

**What Bitdeer shows:**
- AI pivot matters
- ASIC focus = wrong bet in 2025
- Hyperscaler deals = stock performance
- Pure mining = underperformance
