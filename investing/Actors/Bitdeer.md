## Clarington, Ohio project

**Flagship AI data center:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Clarington, Ohio |
| Capacity | **570MW** |
| Target | H2 2027 |
| Investment | "Hundreds of millions, if not billions" |

## ASIC business

**Custom chip strategy:**
- Developing own mining ASICs
- Bitmain spinoff heritage
- Chip delays in 2024 hurt performance
- ASIC sales to other miners

## Setbacks

**Massillon, Ohio fire (2025):**
- 57MW site damaged
- Resuming operations in 2025
- Insurance coverage expected

**Market perception:**
- 2024 stock underperformed peers
- ASIC focus vs AI pivot debate
- Catching up to IREN, Hut 8

---

## AI services

**Current AI exposure:**
- AI cloud on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD
- Near-full utilization reported
- Growing alongside crypto operations

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 570MW Ohio project = major AI capacity
- Co-location model proven by peers
- ASIC business provides diversification
- Singapore-based (geographic diversification)
- Bitmain relationship provides optionality

**Bear:**
- Late to AI pivot vs IREN, Hut 8
- No hyperscaler anchor tenant announced
- Fire setback at Massillon
- Execution track record
- ASIC delays in past
