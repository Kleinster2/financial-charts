## Key calls

### Korea — top overweight (Jun 2024 onwards)

The signature call. Das upgraded Korea to overweight in Jun 2024 and has progressively raised targets as governance reform accelerated under President [[Lee Jae Myung]]:

| Date | KOSPI target | Basis |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Jun 2024 | Overweight initiation | Estimated 0.8x book governance discount |
| Jul 2025 | 5,000 (bull case) | Kospi at ~3,176; +32% YTD; commercial code revision passed |
| Nov 2025 | 6,000 (bull case) | Only 0.2x of 0.8x discount recovered (25%); fair value ~1.6x book |
| Early 2026 | 7,500 (bull case) | Drivers broadening beyond chips — defense, shipbuilding |

Sector picks: [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]] (memory → structural not cyclical), banks, insurance, autos (dividend tax cuts + treasury share cancellation).

On reform credibility: government receptive to market feedback, dividend tax reduced from 45% to 35% top rate, potential mandatory treasury share cancellation.

### India — #1 market in Asia (2024)

Called India JPMorgan's top market globally in Jan 2024. Thesis: [[China plus one]] beneficiary, consumer/business/investor confidence all strong, India-China correlation falling since 2012. Only challenge: investors already overweight, banks the only sector with reasonable valuations.

### China — bearish 2024, upgraded late 2025

| Period | Stance | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2024 | Underweight | Foreign money "extremely unreliable," unlikely to return aggressively |
| Nov 2025 | Overweight | Gave back most outperformance — attractive entry point |
| Dec 2025 | 19% upside to MSCI China | AI advances, consumer initiatives, governance reforms |

### Current allocations (late 2025)

| Market | Stance |
|--------|--------|
| [[South Korea]] | Overweight (top pick) |
| [[China]] | Overweight |
| [[India]] | Overweight |
| [[Taiwan]] | Neutral |
| Southeast Asia | Underweight |
