- **AI positioning**: Scala AI City could reach 4.75GW ($50B investment)
- **Sustainability leader**: Zero water consumption cooling, 100% renewable
- **Strategic location**: Sub-80ms latency to North America via Malbec cable

### Other debt

| Date | Amount | Type | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Mar 2025 | BRL 180M | [[BNDES]] loan | Equipment financing |
| Apr 2025 | BRL 50M | Credit line | Banco Safra |
| May 2025 | $25M | Credit line | Caterpillar Financial |

Capital-intensive model: PE equity + growth equity + Brazilian domestic [[Green bonds]] + development bank financing.

### Financials (2024)

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Net debt | BRL 1.68B | BRL 3.85B | +129% |
| EBITDA | BRL 122M | BRL 255M | +109% |
| EBITDA margin | 23.7% | 36.7% | +13pp |
| Net worth | BRL 3.42B | BRL 4.33B | +27% |

Net debt more than doubled to fund expansion — justified by growth trajectory.

### Exit potential

[[DigitalBridge]] reportedly mandated banks to review LatAm DC assets but waiting for better valuations. Potential sale or IPO.

**Indirect exposure**: [[DigitalBridge]] (DBRG) for public market access.

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- LatAm AI demand explosion — Scala best positioned to capture
- 4.75GW Scala AI City = decades of growth runway
- Sustainability credentials attract hyperscaler partnerships
- Sub-80ms US latency via Malbec cable differentiates vs competitors

**Bear case:**
- Execution risk on massive buildout
- Brazil macro/currency volatility
- Power grid constraints despite approvals
- Private = no direct investment path
