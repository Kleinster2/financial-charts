## Cargo drone: Tianma-1000 (天马-1000)

**First flight:** January 11, 2026

Developed by Xi'an ASN Technology Group (西安爱生技术集团), Norinco subsidiary.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Max payload | **1 ton** |
| Range | 1,800 km |
| Ceiling | 8,000 m |
| Takeoff distance | <200 m |

**Features:**
- High-altitude complex terrain adaptation (Tibet supply runs)
- Ultra-short takeoff/landing
- Modular cargo bay — quick cargo/airdrop mode switch

**Dual-use positioning:** Marketed for civilian logistics (remote resupply, emergency rescue) but specs clearly military-applicable. 1-ton payload, 8km ceiling, short-field ops = battlefield logistics.

## US sanctions

Norinco is on US Entity List — exports of US technology to Norinco require BIS license. Sanctioned for weapons proliferation concerns (Iran, North Korea historically).

---

## Investment lens

Not directly investable for Western capital due to:
- SOE status (no public equity)
- US sanctions
- Defense focus

**Relevant as:**
- China defense industrial base indicator
- Dual-use technology development tracker
- Cargo drone competition (vs Wing, Zipline, etc.)
