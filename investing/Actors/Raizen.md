## Why shareholders won't inject

- [[Shell]] (44%) — won't push above 50%; crossing that threshold forces [[IFRS]] consolidation of R$76.8B gross debt onto [[Shell]]'s balance sheet
- [[Cosan]] (44%) — raised R$10B in Sep 2025 (BTG R$4.5B, [[Perfin]] R$2B, Ometto R$750M) but explicitly ring-fenced from [[Raizen]]; [[Cosan]] shares fell 21% on announcement; 40-50% dilution to existing shareholders
