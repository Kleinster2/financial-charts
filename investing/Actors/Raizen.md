## Q3 FY25/26 results (Feb 13, 2026)

**R$15.65 billion net loss** — the quarter that formalized the crisis in the accounts.

| Metric | Q3 FY25/26 | Q3 prior year | Change |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Net loss | **R$15.65B (~$2.7B)** | R$2.57B | 6x worse |
| Net revenue | R$60.4B (~$10.4B) | R$66.9B | -9.7% |
| Reported EBITDA | **-R$4.4B** | R$2.55B | Swing to negative |
| Adj EBITDA | R$3.15B | R$3.26B | -3.3% |
| Cane crushing | 10.6Mt | 13.8Mt | **-23%** |
| Sugar production | 1.5Mt | 1.8Mt | -17% |
| Ethanol sales | 778K m³ | 895K m³ | -13% |
| Sugar sales | 1.33Mt | 1.17Mt | +14% (accelerated to generate cash) |

**The R$11.1B impairment:** Non-cash write-down required after credit downgrades raised cost-of-capital assumptions, reducing present value of future cash flows. The company acknowledged that a significant portion of invested capital — across ethanol plants, cane fields, and expansion projects — is no longer expected to generate returns justifying its carrying value. Management: *"This provision has no cash impact and may be reversed in the future."*

**Operational contraction:** Cane crushing collapsed 23% due to drought-damaged yields in São Paulo and the shrinking mill footprint from asset sales. Ethanol volumes fell 13%. Sugar sales rose 14% as Raízen accelerated shipments to generate cash.

**The debt spiral:** Interest costs consumed R$7.6B in 9 months — faster than operations generate cash. At 5.3x leverage (was 1.3x just 18 months ago), the debt is self-reinforcing: interest accrues → more debt → more interest.

---

## How they got here — the "foretold crisis"

The crisis unfolded over two years through five compounding failures:

**1. Reckless expansion (2016-2024):**
- Heavy capex across fuel distribution, convenience stores (Oxxo JV with [[Femsa]]), [[E2G]], sugar/ethanol capacity
- Created "a more complex portfolio than ideal and high leverage at an unfavorable moment in the interest rate cycle" (internal source)
- Organizational bloat — new structures and management layers "distracted leadership's attention"

**2. Disastrous Biosev acquisition (2021):**
- Acquired 9 mills from [[Louis Dreyfus Company]] — some in regions where Raízen had never operated, far from existing clusters
- Couldn't capture synergies or efficiency gains
- Several of these mills now being sold back at losses

**3. E2G underdelivered:**
- [[E2G|Second-generation ethanol]] bet fell short of expectations
- Bonfim plant (world's largest E2G facility) not delivering promised returns

**4. Selic rate shock:**
- [[Selic]] hikes in 2025 crushed floating-rate borrowers
- Reverse factoring (90-day) was converted to longer-term bonds at much higher rates
- R$10.9B in new financial instruments replaced R$6-8B/year of reverse factoring
- Gross debt surged R$18B in 12 months (R$52B → R$70B)

**5. Asset sales too slow:**
- R$5B divested in 12 months but couldn't keep pace with debt costs
- CEO Nelson Gomes replaced Ricardo Mussa (Oct-Nov 2024) to lead restructuring
- Cost-cutting and simplification plan launched but overtaken by the debt spiral

**One bright spot:** Intensified enforcement against fuel fraud — shutdown of Refit alone opened ~10% of the distribution market in São Paulo and Rio, absorbed by compliant operators like Raízen.

## The rescue battle (Feb 2026)

Two competing proposals on the table:

### Shell plan (Feb 18)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total injection | ~R$5B |
| Shell contribution | **>R$3.5B** (larger than Cosan) |
| Cosan/Ometto contribution | Remainder |
| Structure | **Keep Raízen whole** |
| Next step | Negotiate with R$55B creditors after injection |
| Debt conversion | Initial conversion of debt into equity likely |
| Follow-on offering | Possible — would dilute Shell if it doesn't participate |

Shell had previously demanded equal contributions but shifted after failing to find a third investor. Shell would not become controlling shareholder — follow-on offering and creditor equity conversion would rebalance. Creditor banks favor this simpler/faster approach.

### BTG/Cosan plan

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total injection | **R$8.3B+** |
| Partners (Cosan + BTG) | R$3B |
| BTG PE arm | R$5.3B (into distribution business) |
| Structure | **Split into two companies** — sugar/ethanol + fuel distribution |
| Additional | Could increase with follow-on offering |

Some creditor banks oppose this — argue splitting the company at this stage would weaken it further and complicate debt negotiations.

### CEO statement (Feb 16)
Nelson Gomes said shareholders are "ready to inject capital" and that cutting debt is "absolutely" a priority for controlling shareholders. Not filing for court-supervised restructuring — for now.

### Fitch response (Feb 19)
Fitch said shareholder pledges were **"too little, too late"** to prevent the 8-notch downgrade. Uncertainty remains over the form and timing of any injection.

---

## Why shareholders won't inject

- [[Shell]] (44%) — won't push above 50%; crossing that threshold forces [[IFRS]] consolidation of R$76.8B gross debt onto [[Shell]]'s balance sheet
- [[Cosan]] (44%) — raised R$10B in Sep 2025 (BTG R$4.5B, [[Perfin]] R$2B, Ometto R$750M) but explicitly ring-fenced from [[Raizen]]; [[Cosan]] shares fell 21% on announcement; 40-50% dilution to existing shareholders

## Restructuring

### Advisers

| Party      | Adviser                                                               |

| Bondholders | [[White & Case]] (legal), [[Moelis]] (financial) — creditor committee formed Feb 11; includes [[PIMCO]], [[BlackRock]], [[T. Rowe Price]]; holds majority of USD bonds |

### Options under discussion

- **Shell plan:** ~R$5B injection, keep whole, then negotiate with creditors (see rescue battle section above)
- **BTG/Cosan plan:** R$8.3B+ injection, split into two companies
- Debt haircut / restructuring (discussed in Feb 4 meetings with advisers)
- Debt-to-equity conversion for creditors
- Follow-on equity offering
- Stake sale to [[Mitsubishi]] (talks since Sep 2025; [[Mitsui]] also interested)
- **Not filing for court-supervised restructuring** — for now

| Aviation fuel distribution unit                                | Up to $200M    | Under evaluation          |
| 3 plants in Mato Grosso do Sul                                 | TBD            | Under evaluation          |

### Recapitalization estimates

| Source                     |  Amount needed                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [[JPMorgan Chase]]         | ~R$18B (to reach 2.5x)              |
| [[UBS BB]]                 | R$20-25B (to reach 2.0-2.5x)        |
| [[Cosan]] CFO (pre-crisis) | R$10-15B capitalization by Mar 2026 |
