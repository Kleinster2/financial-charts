## Why Credit Suisse matters

**First G-SIB failure since 2008.** Credit Suisse was a globally systemically important bank (G-SIB). Its collapse showed that even in 2023, major banks could fail rapidly when confidence evaporates.

**AT1 wipeout precedent.** $17B of Additional Tier 1 bonds written to zero — before equity was wiped out. Controversial, may affect AT1 pricing permanently.

## Investment implications

**No longer exists.** Now part of [[UBS]].

**Lessons:**
1. Even 167-year-old banks can collapse in days
2. Reputation damage compounds — years of scandals eroded trust
3. AT1 bonds riskier than previously understood
4. Swiss "too big to fail" framework failed to prevent bailout
5. Concentration risk — UBS now dominates Swiss banking

**Watch:**
- [[UBS]] integration execution
- Swiss regulatory response
- AT1 bond market pricing globally
