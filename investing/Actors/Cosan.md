| Discount to NAV | >30% (Feb 2026) | Confirmed |
| DSCR | ~1.0x | Confirmed |

## Raizen exposure

Cosan holds ~44% of [[Raizen]], which is in severe financial distress. Raizen's deterioration accelerated through 2025: net debt R$49B and 4.5x leverage at mid-2025, widening to R$55.3B and 5.3x by Dec 2025. By Feb 2026: R$70B+ gross debt, CCC-rated (8-10 notch downgrades), bonds at ~30 cents.

Cosan's R$10.5B equity raise (Sep-Dec 2025) was explicitly ring-fenced from Raizen. S&P revised Cosan's outlook to negative citing Raizen contagion risk. Two competing rescue proposals: [[Shell]] plan (~R$5B, keep whole) vs. [[BTG Pactual]]/Cosan plan (R$8.3B+, split into two). Bank estimates suggest R$18-25B is needed. See [[Raizen]] and [[Raizen debt crisis 2026]] for full detail.

## Analysis

The holding structure has two distinct halves. Compass/Comgas (R$4.2B EBITDA, 22% margin, concession to 2049) and Rumo (R$8.1-8.7B EBITDA guidance, R$27B market cap) are stable, cash-generating regulated or quasi-regulated businesses. Raizen (~44% of Cosan) is in a restructuring that may produce the largest corporate debt crisis in Brazilian history (R$70B+ gross debt, larger than [[Americanas]]).

The Vale stake acquisition (Oct 2022) and exit (Jan 2025) consumed roughly R$10-12B in value — capital that could have pre-funded a Raizen recapitalization or accelerated deleveraging. The Moove IPO failure (Oct 2024) removed another planned source of liquidity. The R$10.5B equity raise (Sep-Dec 2025) was necessary but explicitly excluded Raizen, which means the holding company deleveraged while the largest subsidiary spiraled.

The holding trades at >30% discount to NAV with a DSCR at ~1.0x. The sum-of-parts math is straightforward: Compass/Comgas and Rumo alone are worth more than Cosan's market cap, which means the market is pricing Raizen exposure as a net negative — not just zero, but a liability.

Ometto needed to borrow R$750M from banks to participate in his own R$10.5B capital increase. [[BTG Pactual]] (~23-24.6% post-raise) now has [[Andre Esteves]] as Vice Chairman, with board veto power under a 20-year pact. [[Perfin]] holds a parallel board seat. The degree of Ometto's operational control has narrowed even as his voting stake remains dominant through Aguassanta.

The open question is whether Cosan can insulate itself from Raizen. S&P's negative outlook says the market isn't sure. The ring-fencing of the R$10.5B raise is an explicit attempt to build a firewall, but a 44% stake in a company with R$70B+ in debt and bonds at 30 cents is not easily ring-fenced in practice.
