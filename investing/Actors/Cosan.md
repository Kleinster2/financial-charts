## Price

![[csan3.sa-price-chart.png]]
*R$25 (2021) to R$5.50. Sharp leg down in mid-2025 driven by the dilutive R$10B equity raise (shares fell 21% on announcement, 40-50% dilution).*

## Feb 2026 context

Raised R$10B in equity (Sep 2025) but explicitly told investors none would go to [[Raizen]], which is now in restructuring talks after being downgraded to CCC. [[Cosan]] itself is deleveraging. See [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]].
