## Path to PM (2024-2025)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Sep 2024 | Became Liberal task force chair on economic growth |
| Dec 2024 | Finance Minister Freeland resigned hours before economic statement |
| Jan 6, 2025 | Trudeau announced resignation |
| Jan 16, 2025 | Carney announced leadership bid |
| Mar 9, 2025 | Won Liberal leadership — 85.9% first ballot (surpassed Trudeau's 2013 margin), won all 343 electoral districts |
| Mar 14, 2025 | Sworn in as PM |
| Apr 2025 | Led Liberals to snap election victory |

**Comeback scale:** Liberals were 20+ points behind in polls when Trudeau resigned; soon after Carney became PM, they led. Analysts described turnaround as having "little precedent" in Canadian history.

**Election framing:** Seen as referendum on Trump. Carney — openly defiant of Trump — beat Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.
