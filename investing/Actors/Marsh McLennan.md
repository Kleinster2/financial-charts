## Role in the insurance value chain

Brokers sit between insurers and corporates — they don't take risk, they intermediate it. This makes Marsh McLennan a **fee-based, capital-light** business with recurring revenue (high client retention ~90%+).

**Why this matters for [[PE-insurance convergence]]:** Marsh/Guy Carpenter places the reinsurance business that flows to [[Athene]], [[Munich Re]], [[Swiss Re]], etc. They're the distribution layer for [[Pension risk transfer]], catastrophe reinsurance, and [[Reinsurance sidecars]].
