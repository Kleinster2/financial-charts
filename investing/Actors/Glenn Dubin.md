## Biography

### Early life and education

Born to a Jewish middle-class family in Washington Heights, upper Manhattan. Oldest son of Harvey Dubin (taxi driver, later dress manufacturing) and Edith Dubin (emigrated from Austria, hospital administrator). First in his family to attend college. Graduated Stony Brook University (1978, BA Economics). Played football for the Stony Brook Seawolves. Later made the largest private donation to any SUNY athletics department, funding the Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center and Indoor Training Facility. Received honorary Doctor of Letters from Stony Brook (2012).

### Career at E.F. Hutton (1978-1984)

Started as retail stockbroker at E.F. Hutton & Co. (1978). Moved to institutional trading by early 1980s, developing expertise in risk management and market structure.

### Dubin & Swieca Capital (1984-2005)

In 1984, Dubin and childhood friend [[Henry Swieca]] co-founded Dubin & Swieca Capital Management, an early fund of funds that built multi-manager hedge fund portfolios guided by modern portfolio theory. In 2005, the firm was renamed Corbin Capital Partners after both founders left day-to-day management. The name "Corbin" reportedly comes from a Washington Heights intersection where Dubin and Swieca met at age 5.

## Highbridge Capital Management

### Founding and growth (1992-2004)

Founded in 1992 by Dubin and [[Henry Swieca]] with $35M in initial capital. Named after the 19th-century aqueduct connecting Washington Heights and the Bronx. Started as a multi-strategy hedge fund, evolved into a diversified alternative asset management institution.

### JPMorgan acquisition (2004-2009)

In late 2004, J.P. Morgan Asset Management acquired a 55% stake in Highbridge for $1.3B. Dubin retained operational control as CEO. Between 2004-2007, Highbridge grew to over $35B AUM. JPMorgan acquired substantially all remaining shares in 2009.

### Post-Dubin trajectory

By ~2010, Highbridge employed 315+ people across New York, London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, managing $21B for institutional investors, pension funds, endowments, and family offices. Both co-founders and former president Todd Builione eventually departed. [[Henry Swieca]] founded [[Talpion Fund Management]] (2010); Dubin launched Engineers Gate (2013) and later Dubin & Co. (2020).

In March 2016, the credit/PE arm (Highbridge Principal Strategies, founded 2007 by ex-Goldman team Scott Kapnick, Scot French, Michael Patterson) completed a management buyout from [[JPMorgan Chase]], spinning out as [[HPS Investment Partners]]. HPS grew to ~$120B AUM by 2024 and was acquired by [[BlackRock]] in 2025.

The remaining Highbridge hedge fund operation stayed within JPMorgan. As of 2019, it managed ~$3.9B AUM (within JPMorgan's $150B global alternatives). As of March 2024, ~$7.2B discretionary AUM per Form ADV.

## Other ventures

### Engineers Gate (2013-2020)

Founded 2013 (operational early 2014). Quantitative trading firm building systematic trading strategies. Named after an entrance to Central Park. Dubin held majority stake and served as chairman. [[Tudor Investment Corp|Paul Tudor Jones]] was an early backer with at least 10% equity stake. CPP Investments became the largest investor (Oct 2015); later replaced by [[Blackstone]] (Feb 2020) after CPP withdrew.

Performance through 2019: positive every year, ~5% annualized net-of-fee returns (gross ~13% before fees). Below investor expectations but consistent. Dubin handed control and equity to president Greg Eisner (Jan 2020) as part of retirement from hedge funds. Engineers Gate has since grown significantly -- ~$6.5B discretionary AUM as of March 2024 per Form ADV. Expanded to Singapore (May 2024).

### Castleton Commodities International (2012-present)

## Jeffrey Epstein connection

### Personal relationship

Eva Andersson-Dubin dated [[Jeffrey Epstein]] for approximately 11 years before marrying Glenn Dubin in 1994. Epstein paid for her medical school tuition. After the marriage, Epstein became godfather to the Dubins' three children. The Dubins, often with children, flew on Epstein's planes at least 18 times between 1996 and 2005.

### Post-conviction contact

After Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting a minor for prostitution, the Dubins continued to associate with him. They wrote to his probation officer that they felt "100% comfortable" with Epstein being around their children. Reporting indicates the couple invited Epstein to Thanksgiving dinner while he was a registered sex offender.

In a 2010 email (released in 2026 DOJ document tranche), Eva Andersson-Dubin wrote to Epstein: "Come and visit next week, Celina will have 5 friends over." Celina is the Dubins' daughter. This was two years after Epstein's conviction.

### Financial ties

- Epstein invested $10M in Highbridge Capital in the early 2000s
- Epstein received a $15M fee when [[JPMorgan Chase]] acquired the Highbridge stake (2004), reportedly for introducing Dubin to a JPMorgan executive
- A 2019 JPMorgan suspicious activity report (filed weeks after Epstein's death, later unsealed) flagged ~4,700 transactions totaling $1B+ involving Dubin, [[Leon Black]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], and [[Leslie Wexner]] among others. A Dubin spokesperson said the transactions were for charitable giving, personal gifts, or business matters
- 2026 DOJ files revealed Eva Andersson-Dubin connected a hedge fund manager raising money with Epstein as late as 2016

### Allegations in unsealed court documents

In a 2016 deposition (unsealed August 2019), Virginia Giuffre listed Dubin among businessmen and politicians she alleged [[Ghislaine Maxwell]] and Epstein directed her to have sex with. Dubin denied the allegations through a spokesperson, stating he had flight records and other evidence proving the claims false. The court record contains no direct evidence substantiating the allegations.

Former Dubin household manager Rinaldo Rizzo testified about a 2005 encounter with a 15-year-old girl allegedly trafficked by Epstein who was brought to the Dubins' home. According to Rizzo, the girl told staff that Maxwell and Epstein took her to Epstein's private island and tried to force her to have sex by threatening her and confiscating her passport. Rizzo said Eva Andersson-Dubin told the girl she would be working as a nanny. He said he saw the girl again a month later on a flight to Sweden with the family.

### Legal scrutiny

The U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general subpoenaed both Glenn and Eva Andersson-Dubin and demanded information from Highbridge Capital. As of February 2026, no individual other than Epstein, Maxwell, and Jean-Luc Brunel has been charged with a crime connected to the Epstein case.

### Institutional fallout

In 2019, the Guerrilla Girls launched a campaign to remove Dubin (and [[Leon Black]]) from the MoMA board, citing Epstein ties. Posters installed outside the museum called for removal and for galleries named after the two men to be draped in black. "Strike MoMA" demonstrations continued in 2021. Despite the campaign, Dubin remains a MoMA trustee as of 2026.
