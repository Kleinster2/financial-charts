German inventor who created the Womanizer — first clitoral suction vibrator. Sold company to Johannes Plettenberg; now part of [[Lovehoney Group]].

## Background

Created the first Womanizer in **2014** in Bavaria, Germany. Inspired by a study showing ~50% of women have difficulty orgasming. Development took ~2 years; wife Brigitte helped test prototypes.

## The invention

**Air pulse technology:** Instead of vibration, Womanizer uses air pressure waves for clitoral stimulation. Novel mechanism that created a new product category — now copied by [[Satisfyer]] and others.

## Exit

Sold Womanizer to **Johannes Plettenberg** (2017), who built it into a global brand. Plettenberg merged it with We-Vibe to form WOW Tech Group (2018), which later merged with Lovehoney (2021).

Lenke is no longer involved in management but the technology he invented now drives a significant portion of the sexual wellness industry.
