**Lisuan** — Chinese GPU startup targeting consumer gaming. G100 is China's first "real" gaming GPU (Dec 2025). Claims [[RTX]] 4060 rival, but early benchmarks show GTX 660 Ti performance.

> **Key insight:** Even if G100 performs like a 2012 card, creating a functional gaming GPU architecture from scratch on domestic 6nm is a "zero to one" breakthrough. Software can improve; the hard part is done.

## Why Lisuan matters

First Chinese company seriously targeting consumer gaming GPUs:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | Late 2021 |
| Founders | Ex-Silicon Valley engineers |
| HQ | China |
| Key product | G100 gaming GPU |
| Architecture | "TrueGPU" |

## Lisuan G100

**China's first "real" gaming GPU (shipping Dec 2025):**

| Spec (claimed) | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Process | 6nm (domestic, not [[TSMC]]) |
| FP32 | 24 TFLOPS |
| [[Target]] | [[RTX]] 4060 competitor |
| Features | DirectX 12, Windows on ARM |

**[[Benchmark]] reality (alleged Geekbench):**

| Spec (leaked) | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Compute Units | 32 |
| Clock speed | 300 MHz |
| VRAM | 256 MB |
| OpenCL score | 15,524 |
| Equivalent | GeForce GTX 660 Ti (2012) |

**The gap:** Claims [[RTX]] 4060, benchmarks like GTX 660 Ti. Likely engineering sample / driver issues, but underlying silicon may be weaker than claimed.

## Why it still matters

**The "zero to one" achievement:**

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Boots Windows | ✓ |
| Runs DirectX 12 | ✓ |
| Functional API support | ✓ |
| [[Consumer]]-ready | ✓ (shipping) |
| Domestic supply chain | ✓ (no [[TSMC]]) |

**What can improve with software:**
- Drivers
- Clock speeds
- Memory management
- Game compatibility

**What's hard to change:**
- Core architecture
- Silicon capability
- Die size

## Captive market: Xinchuang

**Government backing guarantees market:**

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Xinchuang initiative | Replace tens of millions of foreign PCs |
| Captive users | Guaranteed volume for R&D iteration |
| Funding | State-backed |
| Competition shield | Protected from open-market death |

Unlike Western startups (3dfx, etc.), Lisuan has guaranteed demand to fund iterations.

## History of Chinese gaming GPUs

| Year | Company | Product | Result |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2006 | Jingjia Micro | JM series | Military only, no DirectX |
| 2018+ | "Four Little Dragons" | Various | AI focus, not gaming |
| 2022 | [[Moore Threads]] | MTT S80 | First PCIe 5.0, poor drivers |
| 2025 | **Lisuan** | G100 | First "real" gaming GPU |

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Lisuan advantage | Lisuan disadvantage |
|----|------------------|---------------------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Domestic market access | Technology gap (10+ years) |
| [[AMD]] | Captive market | Performance, ecosystem |
| [[Moore Threads]] | [[Gaming]] focus | Less mature |
| [[Intel]] Arc | China market | Technology, drivers |

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (private startup).

**What it signals:**
- China GPU ecosystem maturing
- Export controls driving domestic innovation
- [[Gaming]] = harder than AI inference (needs drivers, compatibility)
- "Zero to one" done; "one to N" in progress

**Timeline:** Competitive mid-range GPU? 2-5 years. Flagship? 5-10 years. Maybe never for cutting edge.
