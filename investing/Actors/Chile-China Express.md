## Why it matters

The cable would provide [[Chile]] — and by extension South America — a direct fiber link to [[China]], bypassing US-controlled routing. Under [[China]]'s 2017 Cybersecurity Law, companies must cooperate with state intelligence, raising data-sovereignty concerns.

The US views this as a direct competitor to the [[Humboldt Cable]] (Google/NEC, Chile → Australia), which routes through allied nations.
