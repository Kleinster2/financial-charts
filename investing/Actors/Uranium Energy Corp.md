## Why UEC matters

UEC is the largest pure-play US uranium producer:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | UEC |
| HQ | Corpus Christi, Texas |
| Method | In-situ leaching (ISL) |
| Status | Ramping production |

---

## Operations

| Project | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Hobson | Texas | Operating |
| Palangana | Texas | Operating |
| Christensen Ranch | Wyoming | Restarting |
| Multiple others | US | Development |

ISL = environmentally preferred, lower cost.

## US uranium strategic value

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Energy security | Domestic supply |
| [[Russia]] sanctions | Alternative to Russian uranium |
| SMR growth | HALEU feedstock |
| DOD interest | Strategic stockpile |

US has near-zero uranium production historically. UEC is changing that.

## Competitive position

| vs Competitors | UEC position |
|----------------|--------------|
| vs [[Cameco]] | Smaller but US-based |
| vs [[Kazatomprom]] | Higher cost but no geopolitics |
| vs Ur-Energy | Similar size, competitor |

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- US energy security play
- [[Nuclear renaissance]] tailwind
- ISL low-cost method
- [[Russia]] sanctions beneficiary
- Pure-play exposure

**Bear:**
- Small vs global giants
- [[Uranium]] price sensitive
- Execution risk on ramp
- No enrichment (upstream only)
