CoBank, ACB is a cooperative bank chartered as an Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) under the Farm Credit Act of 1971. One of four banks in the [[Farm Credit System]], it is the only one with ACB status, giving it broader lending authority than the three Farm Credit Banks (FCBs). CoBank lends directly to agricultural cooperatives, rural infrastructure providers (power, water, communications), and finances US agricultural exports -- authorities the FCBs lack. It also serves as the wholesale funding bank for 16 affiliated Farm Credit associations across 23 states.

CoBank is not a commercial bank. It cannot accept deposits. It is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that funds itself through the capital markets via the [[Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation]], which issues joint and several debt on behalf of all four FCS banks. This GSE status gives CoBank access to near-Treasury borrowing costs and makes its debt instruments attractive to fixed-income investors.

## Business segments

CoBank operates through three segments:

### 1. Agribusiness

Direct lending to agricultural cooperatives and agribusiness companies nationwide. This is CoBank's unique ACB authority -- the three FCBs cannot do this.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average loans (Q1 2025) | $44.8B (+12% YoY) |
| Average loans (Q1 2024) | $39.9B |
| Borrower types | Grain cooperatives, farm supply co-ops, food processors, dairy, protein, biofuels, forest products, export finance |
| Commodity coverage | Grains, oilseeds, farm supply, dairy, protein, livestock, fruits/nuts/vegetables, cotton, sugar, rice, biofuels, forest products, consumer packaged food, beverage, packaging, distribution |
| Seasonality | Significant -- grain and farm supply lending peaks with crop cycles |

Also includes export financing and international banking services for farmer-owned cooperatives.

### 2. Farm Credit Banking

Wholesale funding for 16 affiliated Farm Credit associations that serve individual farmers and ranchers.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Loans outstanding (Mar 31, 2025) | $82.8B |
| Loans outstanding (Dec 31, 2024) | $84.1B |
| End borrowers served | 78,000+ farmers, ranchers, rural borrowers |
| Geographic coverage | 23 states (western US, parts of Midwest, New England, Alaska, Hawaii) |
| Margin profile | Narrower margins than direct lending (wholesale pricing to associations) |

This is the largest segment by loan volume but generates lower net income per dollar lent due to wholesale pricing.

### 3. Rural Infrastructure

Direct lending to rural power, water, and communications providers.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Electric co-op penetration | >75% of US electric distribution, transmission, and generation cooperatives bank with CoBank |
| Services | Long-term loans, leases, construction loans, revolving credit |
| Sub-sectors | Electric distribution cooperatives, G&T cooperatives, water/wastewater utilities, telecom carriers, broadband providers, cable, wireless |

CoBank is a dominant lender to rural electric cooperatives -- the institutions that serve the "last mile" of the US grid. This positions it at the center of the [[Grid infrastructure super-cycle]].

## Patronage (cooperative economics)

As a cooperative, CoBank returns profits to customer-owners through patronage distributions rather than dividends to external shareholders. This is the core economic proposition for borrowers -- they get competitive lending rates plus a rebate on interest paid.

| Year | Patronage distributions | Special distribution | Stock retirements |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| FY2024 | $1.032B (record) | $110M all-cash (March 2025) | $53M |
| FY2023 | $965M | $106M | — |

The special distribution represents a 12-16% increase over target patronage, depending on program rate. CoBank's board approved both the special cash distribution and stock retirements at its December 2024 meeting.

## Funding mechanism

CoBank cannot accept deposits. It funds its lending operations primarily through the capital markets:

### Systemwide debt securities

The [[Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation]] (located in New York) issues consolidated debt securities on behalf of all four FCS banks. These are the primary funding source.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Issuer | Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation |
| Obligors | All four FCS banks (joint and several liability) |
| Ratings | AA+ / Aa1 / AA+ (S&P / Moody's / Fitch) |
| BIS risk weight | 20% (same as other GSE debt) |
| Tax treatment | Interest exempt from state, local, and municipal income taxes |
| US government guarantee | None -- these are not US government obligations |
| Insurance | [[Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation|FCSIC]] insures timely payment of principal and interest |
| FCSIC fund (Sep 2025) | $8.4B |
| Total FCS debt outstanding (2024) | ~$448B |
| Spread to Treasuries | Narrow (few basis points) due to GSE status |

The four banks are jointly and severally liable for all systemwide debt. If one bank cannot pay, the [[Farm Credit Administration]] can call on the others. This joint liability effectively mutualizes credit risk across the entire system.

### CoBank individual issuances

In addition to systemwide debt, CoBank issues its own preferred stock to build regulatory capital:

| Series | Date | Amount | Terms |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Series L preferred | Apr 2024 | $300M | Fixed 7.250% to Jul 2029, then resets every 5yr (5yr Treasury + 2.880%). Non-cumulative perpetual. J.P. Morgan / [[Morgan Stanley]] bookrunners |
| Series M preferred | Nov 2024 | — | Fixed rate to Jan 2030, then 5yr resets. Non-cumulative perpetual. Used to finance potential redemption of Series H |
| Series H preferred (CKNQP) | Earlier | — | Fixed-to-floating rate, non-cumulative perpetual. Trades OTC |

---

## Investability

CoBank is a cooperative -- you cannot buy equity. But investors can access CoBank credit through several channels:

| Instrument | Access | Key features |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Farm Credit Systemwide bonds | Broker-dealer, institutional | AA+/Aa1/AA+ rated, state tax-exempt interest, daily issuance across maturities, 20% BIS risk weight |
| CoBank preferred stock (CKNQP) | OTC Markets | Series H fixed-to-floating, non-cumulative perpetual preferred. Trades on OTCMKTS |
| CoBank Series L/M preferred | Private placement (144A) | Institutional only, not publicly traded |

Farm Credit debt trades as "agency" paper alongside [[Fannie Mae]], [[Freddie Mac]], and [[Federal Home Loan Banks]] securities. Interest earned is exempt from state and local taxes, making it attractive for taxable accounts in high-tax states. However, unlike Treasury securities, Farm Credit debt carries no explicit US government guarantee -- it relies on GSE status, joint and several liability of the four banks, and the [[Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation|FCSIC]] insurance fund.

---

## Farm Credit System context

CoBank is one of four banks in the [[Farm Credit System]], a GSE created by Congress in 1916. The system is the largest agricultural lender in the US, holding 45.8% of all US farm debt (2023) versus 34.9% for all commercial banks combined.

| Bank | Charter | Headquarters | Associations | Geographic focus |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| CoBank | ACB | Denver, CO | 16 | Western US, Midwest, New England, AK, HI + nationwide co-op/utility lending |
| [[AgriBank]] | FCB | St. Paul, MN | 11 | Northern central US, parts of Midwest |
| [[AgFirst Farm Credit Bank]] | FCB | Columbia, SC | 16 | Southeast, mid-Atlantic, [[Puerto Rico]] |
| [[Farm Credit Bank of Texas]] | FCB | Austin, TX | 12 | TX, AL, LA, MS, most of NM |

CoBank is the largest and most diversified of the four, with the broadest lending authority (cooperative lending, export finance, rural infrastructure -- authorities the FCBs lack).

Global Finance ranked all four among the world's 50 safest banks: [[AgriBank]] (\#35), CoBank (\#44), [[AgFirst Farm Credit Bank|AgFirst]] (\#46), [[Farm Credit Bank of Texas]] (\#47).

## Rural infrastructure angle

CoBank's rural infrastructure lending connects directly to the [[Grid infrastructure super-cycle]]:

### Electric cooperatives

Over 75% of US electric distribution, transmission, and generation cooperatives bank with CoBank. These co-ops serve rural America's "last mile" -- the same infrastructure that needs massive investment for grid modernization, resilience, and electrification.

CoBank finances traditional electric infrastructure, smart grid technology, retail broadband, distributed energy resources (DERs), utility-scale renewables, behind-the-meter solar, and EV infrastructure.

### Rural broadband

Electric cooperatives are increasingly deploying fiber broadband to their rural members -- leveraging existing pole and right-of-way infrastructure. CoBank is a primary financier of these builds:

| Deal | Amount | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| East Central Energy (MN) | $150M | Multiple advance term loans for fiber-to-home. ~4,000 homes/businesses connected, 2,000 miles of fiber by end of 2024 |
| United Electric Cooperative | $80M | Financing package (CoBank + 4 additional Farm Credit lenders) for fiber expansion beyond electric territory |

### BEAD program challenges

CoBank's 2025 year-ahead report flagged risks to the $42.5B federal [[BEAD]] broadband program: low operator participation, complicated requirements, and small operators lacking resources to comply. Political uncertainty could blunt the program's impact on closing the rural digital divide.

### Sustainability lending

In November 2024, CoBank originated its first sustainability-linked loan to Heartland Co-op (with EDF support), offering a reduced interest rate contingent on meeting water quality targets including expanded cover crop usage and nutrient management.

## Recent developments (2024-2025)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Apr 2024 | Issued $300M Series L preferred stock (7.250% fixed, resets 2029) |
| Nov 2024 | Announced Series M preferred stock offering |
| Nov 2024 | First sustainability-linked loan (Heartland Co-op) |
| Dec 2024 | Board approved $110M special all-cash patronage + $53M stock retirements |
| Dec 2024 | Released 2025 year-ahead report -- rural economy faces volatile conditions, policy uncertainty |
| Jan 2025 | FCA capital rule changes took effect (closer to international banking standards for cooperative structure) |
| Oct 2024 | FCA delayed high-volatility CRE risk weight rule (150% vs 100%) from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026 |

### Credit quality deterioration (2025)

Adverse classified assets rose to 3.51% of risk-adjusted assets (Jun 30, 2025) from 2.89% (Dec 31, 2024). Deterioration driven by agribusiness, real estate mortgage, production and intermediate-term, and communications loans. Q1 2025 net income fell 11% YoY due to higher provision for credit losses.

## Risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Agricultural commodity cycles | Agribusiness segment directly exposed to grain, oilseed, protein price volatility. Seasonal lending swings with crop cycles |
| Trade/tariff uncertainty | Rural industries disproportionately exposed to federal trade policy. Tariffs on agricultural exports directly impact borrowers |
| Rural real estate | Farm Credit associations lend against agricultural real estate -- farmland values are cyclical |
| Cooperative borrower concentration | Customer base is cooperatives, not diversified commercial borrowers. Co-op financial health correlates with ag commodity cycles |
| Credit quality | Adverse classified assets rising (3.51% mid-2025). Communications and agribusiness loans showing stress |
| Interest rate sensitivity | Grid and rural infrastructure lending is long-duration, capital-intensive. Higher rates compress borrower economics |
| GSE status risk | No explicit government guarantee. If US sovereign rating drops, FCS debt ratings follow (Fitch downgraded FCS banks from AA- to A+ in 2023 after US sovereign downgrade) |
| BEAD program execution | Rural broadband lending thesis partly depends on federal funding flowing to co-op borrowers |
| Labor shortages | Rural economy faces structural labor constraints -- relevant to both borrower operations and infrastructure buildout |
