## Why Ansaldo matters

Emerging AI infrastructure power supplier:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Genoa, Italy |
| Parent | CDP Equity (Italian state) |
| Product | Gas turbines |
| AI deal | OpenAI UAE Stargate |

---

## OpenAI Stargate deal (Jan 2026)

**Per SemiAnalysis:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Turbine model | AE94.3 |
| Quantity | 4 units |
| Capacity each | 340MW |
| Gross total | 1.3GW |
| Derated capacity | **1GW** (desert heat -23%) |

**Why derated:** High ambient temperature in UAE desert reduces turbine efficiency by ~23%.

## AE94.3 turbine

**Heavy-duty gas turbine:**
- Combined cycle capable
- High efficiency class
- Used for power generation
- Suitable for data center baseload

---

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Focus | AI exposure |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Ansaldo Energia** | Gas turbines | OpenAI UAE |
| [[GE Vernova]] | Gas + wind + nuclear | Multiple hyperscalers |
| [[Siemens Energy]] | Gas + wind | [[Meta]] Socrates South, European DCs |
| [[Solar Turbines]] (CAT) | Mid-size GTs | [[Meta]] Socrates South |
| Mitsubishi Power | Gas turbines | [[Japan]]/[[Asia]] focus |

Ansaldo smaller than GE/[[Siemens]] but winning AI deals.

---

## BYOP pattern

Ansaldo benefits from "Bring Your Own Power" trend:
- Hyperscalers can't get grid power fast enough
- On-site generation = faster deployment
- Gas turbines = proven technology
- Unlike nuclear, can deploy in ~2 years

See [[Power constraints]] for full context.

## Investment implications

**Not easily investable** (Italian state-owned), but validates:
- Gas turbine demand for AI
- BYOP pattern accelerating
- European suppliers in the mix (not just US)

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Genoa, Italy |
| Owner | CDP Equity |
| Key product | AE94.3 gas turbine |
| OpenAI deal | 4x 340MW units (1.3GW gross) |
