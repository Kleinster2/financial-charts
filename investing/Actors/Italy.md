## Merz-Meloni defense axis (Feb 2026)

Merz has aligned with Meloni, presenting [[Germany]] and Italy as Europe's two manufacturing powerhouses. Perverse given Olaf Scholz's stated fear of a post-fascist Italian government.

**Defense angle:** [[Leonardo]] as partner for [[Rheinmetall]]/[[Airbus]], partly because [[Dassault Aviation]] is uncooperative on FCAS. Italy and Germany share industrial manufacturing DNA that [[France]] and Spain don't.

**The debt constraint:** Italy can't match German defense spending (~$189B by 2029) without EU common debt issuance. Italian debt at ~140% of GDP makes national defense ramp-up dangerous — risks bond market panic. Italy's main leverage is Germany's need for allies in EU negotiations.

**Atlanticist play:** Meloni performing the Atlanticist role with Trump while maintaining her post-fascist political lineage. This alignment with Germany adds European credibility.
