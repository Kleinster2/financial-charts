## Why it matters

Kiva's autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) pioneered the "goods-to-person" model — robots bring shelves to workers instead of workers walking to shelves. This single acquisition gave Amazon a **decade-long lead** in fulfillment automation, growing from 1K robots (2013) to 1M+ (2025).
