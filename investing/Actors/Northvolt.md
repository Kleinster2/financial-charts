**Northvolt** — Swedish lithium-ion battery manufacturer. Founded 2016 by ex-[[Tesla]] executives. Europe's best-funded homegrown battery champion. Raised ~$14B, peaked at $11.8B valuation (Jun 2021). Filed Chapter 11 Nov 2024, Swedish bankruptcy Mar 2025. Largest bankruptcy in modern Swedish industrial history.

## Why Northvolt matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2016 |
| HQ | Stockholm, Sweden |
| Main factory | Northvolt Ett, Skellefteå |
| Peak valuation | **$11.8B** (Jun 2021) |
| Total raised | **~$14B** (equity + debt) |
| Peak employees | ~6,000 |
| Debt at bankruptcy | **$5.8B** |
| Cash at bankruptcy | **$30M** (1 week runway) |
| Status | **Bankrupt** (Mar 2025) |

**Lesson:** Capital alone doesn't buy manufacturing expertise. Northvolt raised more than any European climate startup in history but couldn't achieve basic production yields.

---

## The pitch

Northvolt positioned itself as Europe's answer to Asian battery dominance — a homegrown champion that could reduce dependence on [[CATL]], [[Samsung SDI]], and Chinese suppliers. Key selling points:

| Advantage | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Green energy (Swedish hydro) | Real — Skellefteå powered by renewables |
| European supply chain | Partially — still heavily dependent on Chinese cathode material and machinery |
| Ex-Tesla leadership | Real — but supply chain ≠ manufacturing |
| $14B orders from OEMs | Real — but couldn't deliver |

## What went wrong

### Production catastrophe

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Northvolt Ett capacity | 16 GWh | — |
| 2023 deliveries | 16,000 MWh | **80 MWh** (0.5%) |
| 2024 production | 1 GWh+ | <1 GWh |
| Battery yield | 90%+ industry norm | **70%** after 4 years |

A Chinese executive's comparison: "We can raise a factory's battery yield to 96% in just four months. Northvolt took four years and only achieved 70%."

### Root causes

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **No manufacturing DNA** | Founders were supply chain, not production |
| **Talent gap** | "We didn't have enough people who knew what they were doing" — former factory head Mark Duchesne |
| **Chinese dependency** | Machines came with Chinese manuals, required Zoom support to operate |
| **Cathode quality** | Mixing section failed — virtually all material sent to recycling |
| **Expansion before execution** | Built multiple sites before proving one worked |

### Customer defections

| Customer       | Order                | Outcome                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[BMW]]        | $2.3B (2020)         | **Cancelled Jun 2024** — quality issues, 2-year delays. Switched to [[Samsung SDI]] |
| [[Volkswagen]] | $14B (10-year, 2021) | VW owns 23% but refused rescue; own EV crisis                                       |
| [[Volvo Cars]] | JV partner           | Exited joint venture                                                                |
| [[Scania]]     | Ongoing              | Only customer left by end; acquired industrial unit                                 |

## Safety incidents

### 2024 worker deaths

Four employees died within six months — three found dead at home after shifts, one drowning. Police investigated; Dec 2024 concluded no evidence of crime or workplace exposure. Company called it "tragic coincidence."

### 2023 workplace accidents

- Nov 2023: Worker suffered burns from production line explosion; died Dec 2023
- Dec 2023: NCC construction worker died in crane incident

### Broader safety record

Since 2019: 26 employees severely injured according to Dagens Nyheter investigation. Swedish toxicologist called for plant closure for investigation.

## Cautionary lessons

### For Europe's industrial policy

| Dream | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Homegrown champion | Dependent on Chinese suppliers |
| Green manufacturing | Production so bad, most output went to recycling |
| Jobs creation | 5,000 → 1,700 → liquidation |
| Strategic autonomy | Assets sold to US company (Lyten) |

### For climate investing

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Capital solves problems | $14B couldn't buy manufacturing know-how |
| Ex-FAANG talent transfers | Supply chain ≠ production |
| Europe can compete | 70% yield vs China's 96% in 4 months |
| First-mover advantage | Execution matters more than timing |
