## Why Enflame matters

Tencent's GPU bet, with key advantage — not sanctioned:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | March 2018 |
| Founders | Ex-AMD |
| Key backer | [[Tencent]] (21% stake) |
| US status | NOT on Entity List |
| Total funding | $746M |
| IPO | In preparation |

## L600 chip (4th gen)

**Unveiled WAIC July 2025:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Memory | 144GB on-chip |
| Bandwidth | 3.6TB/s |
| Precision | FP8 support |
| Use case | Training + inference |

Designed for large model training at lower cost.

---

## Tencent backing

**Strategic investor:**
- 21% stake (largest shareholder)
- WeChat, gaming ecosystem
- Captive customer for AI chips
- [[Tencent]] cloud deployment

**Big Fund:** China IC Industry Investment Fund holds 5%.

---

## Key advantage: NOT sanctioned

**Unlike [[Biren Tech]]:**
- Can still use TSMC
- Access to advanced nodes
- Manufacturing flexibility
- Reuters: had to adjust designs for TSMC requirements

This is a significant competitive advantage.

## Product generations

| Gen | Products | Timeline |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 1st | DTU (training) | 2019-2020 |
| 2nd | CloudBlazer | 2021 |

## IPO preparation

**STAR board IPO (Shanghai):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target raise | ~2B yuan (~$275M) |
| Exchange | STAR board (Nasdaq-style) |
| Status | In preparation |
| Valuation | ~$1.65B+ (Sept 2024) |

**STAR board advantage:** Friendly to loss-making but fast-growth startups.

Last of Four Little Dragons to IPO.
