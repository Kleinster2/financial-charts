**Micron Technology (MU)** — U.S.-based memory company, third of the Big 3 in DRAM/NAND.

## Core thesis

Micron benefits from the same [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] dynamics as Korean players, but with different positioning: U.S.-based, less China exposure, behind on HBM but catching up.

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| DRAM | #3 (behind Samsung, SK Hynix) |
| NAND | #4 (behind Samsung, SK Hynix, Kioxia) |
| HBM | #3 (behind SK Hynix, Samsung) |

---

## Key strengths

- **U.S.-based**: Less geopolitical risk than Korea/Taiwan
- **Memory shortage tailwind**: Same pricing power as Korean peers
- **HBM ramp**: Catching up, NVIDIA qualified
- **Less China exposure**: Not subject to same [[Export controls]] pressure on China fabs

---

## Key weaknesses

- **HBM behind**: SK Hynix has the lead, Samsung #2
- **Scale disadvantage**: Smaller than Samsung in memory
- **Technology gap**: Historically trailed Korean leaders on density/cost

---

## HBM status

- Behind [[SK Hynix]] (leader) and [[Samsung]]
- Qualified with NVIDIA — ramping supply
- Key question: Can they catch up on HBM margins?

---

## Competitive dynamics

| vs Competitor | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | Behind on HBM, similar DRAM exposure |
| [[Samsung]] | Behind on scale, similar shortage benefit |
| [[CXMT]] | Ahead, but CXMT catching up via [[IP leakage risk]] |

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MU (NASDAQ) |
| HQ | Boise, Idaho, USA |
| Position | #3 DRAM, #4 NAND |
| HBM | Ramping, #3 — share now in line with DRAM share |
| **Stock YTD** | **+229%** (best in semi) |

## Q1 FY26 earnings (Dec 2025)

| Metric | Q1 FY26 | Q2 FY26 Guide |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Revenue | $13.6B (+57% y/y) | $18.7B |
| Gross margin | 56.8% | 68% |
| FY26 capex | $20B (raised from $18B) | |

**Key quotes:**
- "Largest ever seen supply-demand gap"
- Only meeting 50-67% of demand from key customers
- Tightness to persist through and beyond CY2026

## Strategic pivot: Crucial exit (Dec 2025)

**Killing consumer memory brand by Feb 2026.**

Why:
- Consumer DDR5 prices 3-4x higher in 6 months
- Can't supply consumer at current pricing
- Enterprise/AI margins much higher
- Shortage makes consumer allocation irrational

**Implication**: Full pivot to enterprise/AI memory. Consumer PC/gaming market will feel the squeeze even more.

Validates [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] — when suppliers exit consumer, shortage is severe.

**HBM:**
- CY26 HBM supply fully contracted (price AND volume)
- HBM4 on track for 2Q26 ramp
- HBM TAM: $35B (2025) → $100B (2028) — 40% CAGR
- DDR5 being bundled with HBM in some LTAs
- Singapore HBM packaging on track for CY27

**Pricing:**
- DRAM ASP +20% q/q
- Both HBM and non-HBM have strong profitability
- Margins expected to expand for DRAM and NAND

**Capacity:**
- Idaho Fab 1 pulled in to mid-CY27
- Idaho Fab 2 starts construction '26, operational end of '28
- NY Fab supply expected 2030+
- India back-end ramping in '26

---

## Capex trajectory

- **FY24-FY27**: 4 straight years of capex growth — first time in 25+ years
- **Capital intensity**: Dropping below 30% in FY26 (vs 35% through-cycle guidance)
- **FY26 timing**: 2H weighted — aligns with semicap acceleration

Revenue growing faster than capex = improving returns on investment. Bullish signal for memory cycle and [[Long WFE]].

## Segment profitability (Dec 2025)

GM fall-through (incremental GP / incremental revenue):

| Segment | Acceleration | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Mobile (MCBU) | +64.5 pts | Best — shortage driving pricing |
| Auto (AEBU) | +63.2 pts | Strong |
| Cloud (CMBU) | +44.1 pts | AI demand |
| Core DC (CDBU) | -127.2 pts | Decelerating |

Mobile squeeze is real — strongest profit momentum. Core DC weakest.

---

## Market expectations

**Priced in:**
- Memory shortage benefits
- HBM revenue growth
- Cyclical recovery
- **Stock +229% YTD — market has recognized the thesis**

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- HBM share gains vs SK Hynix
- Shortage worse than expected → pricing power
- Mobile squeeze stronger than expected
- U.S. fab incentives ([[CHIPS Act]])

**Risk**: At +229%, a lot of good news is priced in. Disappointment risk rising.

---

## For theses

**[[Long memory]]**:
- Benefits from same shortage dynamics as Korea
- U.S.-based = geopolitical diversification
- #3 HBM but ramping

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**:
- Complicates the thesis — Micron benefits from same drivers
- Alternative: Long Korea + Long Micron for diversification
