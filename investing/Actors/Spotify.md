## History

2006: Ek co-founded Spotify during piracy crisis (Napster era). Music industry in freefall — CD sales collapsing, 99¢ iTunes downloads not viable alternative.

2006–2018: Built service compelling enough to convert freeloaders to payers. "Saved" the music industry from piracy.

2019–2021: Podcast spending spree — billion-dollar acquisitions of studios, tech, talent. Joe Rogan deal ($200M+).

2022 crisis:
- Jan: Neil Young pulled catalog over Rogan anti-vaccine content. Other artists followed.
- Ek refused to discipline Rogan, insisted Spotify was "neutral platform"
- Stock cratered 80% from peak, below IPO price
- Analysts questioned if Spotify could ever be profitable

2023–2024 turnaround:
- Söderström/Norström named co-presidents (Jan 2023)
- Scaled back podcast spending
- Cut 17%+ of workforce
- Added audiobooks (15 hrs/month in premium)
- Stock more than doubled in 2024, exceeded $500

2024: First profitable full year.

## Leadership (Jan 2026 transition)

| Role | Person | Background |
|------|--------|------------|
| Executive Chairman | [[Daniel Ek]] | Founder, CEO 2006–2025 |
| Co-CEO | Gustav Söderström | Swedish military → mobile startup (Yahoo acquired) → Spotify 2009, first head of mobile |
| Co-CEO | Alex Norström | Half-Swedish, half-Chinese; mother ran Chinese restaurant; joined Spotify 2011, growth → label relations |

The co-CEO dynamic: Söderström and Norström describe their approach as "synchronized swimming" vs. "competitive swimming" (defined swim lanes). They meet with all 14 direct reports in single group meetings. Ek is tiebreaker but has never had to make a final call unilaterally.

Söderström: Detail-oriented, meets with junior employees regularly. Philosophy-focused — reads David Deutsch, hosts podcast interviews with scientists. Known for eating full-size carrots in meetings.

Norström: Rebuilt Spotify's label relationships. David Israelite (NMPA CEO): "I have lived through the entire existence of Spotify... I haven't spoken to [[Daniel Ek]] one time" — but has spoken with Norström multiple times.

## Artist payment controversy

The royalty math misconception:
Streaming doesn't pay flat per-stream rates. Royalty depends on total subscribers and activity. Spotify pays 60%+ of revenue to rights holders. Co-CEOs say "biggest communications mistake" was not explaining this early.

Bundle controversy (2024):
After adding audiobooks, Spotify classified service as "bundle" → pays less to songwriters under NMPA deal terms.
- Cost songwriters $230M in first year (per NMPA)
- Lawsuit filed, dismissed by judge who agreed it was "properly characterized as a bundle"
- Amended complaint pending

Grammy boycott (Jan 2025):
Songwriter of the year nominees refused Spotify-hosted party. Winner Jessie Jo Dillon: "It is better for me and my entire songwriter community to be paid fairly for our art."

Artist departures:
- Neil Young (2022, returned 2024)
- Independent artists (Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu) — object to Ek's [[Helsing]] defense investment, ICE recruitment ads
- Spotify says independent artists = 50% of $10B paid to rights holders (2024)

## AI and product strategy

Current AI features:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DJ X | AI-voiced DJ curating personalized playlists |
| Prompted Playlists | Type idea → get custom playlist based on taste + trends |
| [[ChatGPT]] partnership | Spotify surfaces in [[ChatGPT]] conversations |
| Meta AI glasses | Spotify on Meta's smart glasses |

AI-generated music policy:
- Won't ban wholly AI-created content
- Will label it (encouraging uploaders to disclose)
- Only intervenes if impersonation without permission or fraud
- NC man indicted for using AI bots to stream AI songs billions of times

Planned: Music Pro tier
Expensive premium tier in development. "We will not release something that we don't think is good."

## Risks and challenges

Gen Z perception:
Midia Research: "For Gen Z, Spotify just looks like NPR — it's part of the establishment, the old guard." Orange (not red) indicators.

Algorithm fatigue:
Users complain about being auto-fed content. Prompted Playlists is response — "gain control over the algorithm."

Competition for attention:
Meta, Netflix, TikTok, YouTube all competing for same hours. Video podcasts growing on YouTube, not Spotify.

Developing markets:
Growing fastest but:
- Ad budgets smaller
- Conversion to premium uncertain
- Unit economics unclear

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- 713M MAUs, 32% market share (2x competitors)
- First profitable year 2024, continuing
- Price increases sticking — users log in 25/30 days (up from 21)
- Audiobooks/video diversification working
- $10B to rights holders annually

Bear:
- Label/songwriter relations remain hostile
- Gen Z "establishment" perception
- Algorithm fatigue vs. TikTok discovery
- AI music slop eroding trust
- Ek's defense/political investments alienating artists
- Music Pro tier delayed indefinitely
