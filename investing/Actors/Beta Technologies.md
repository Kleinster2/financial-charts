## Amazon stake non-event (Feb 2026)

On Feb 11, 2026, [[Amazon]] filed a routine Schedule 13G with the SEC disclosing its 11.75M share (~5.3%) position. Financial media mischaracterized this as a new investment:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2021 | Amazon Climate Pledge Fund invests in Beta (pre-IPO venture round) |
| Oct 2025 | Stake disclosed in Beta's IPO filings |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Amazon files routine 13G restating existing position |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Barron's: "Beta stock soars 25%. Thank Amazon" — traders pile in |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Stock jumps from $16.77 to $20+ after hours (+25%) |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Barron's changes headline: "The Amazon move doesn't make sense" |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Stock retains most gains, closes at $19.39 |

**Nothing new happened.** A routine SEC filing created a misinformation-driven pump. Classic example of how thinly traded post-IPO stocks can move on misread regulatory filings.

## Post-IPO decline

Stock has fallen ~43% from its $34 IPO price in ~3 months. eVTOL sector broadly under pressure — pre-revenue companies with long certification timelines in a higher-rate environment.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Amazon backing validates technology for logistics/cargo use
- FAA certification in 2026 would be a major catalyst
- Electric aviation is a secular growth theme
- Vermont manufacturing (US-based supply chain)

**Bear:**
- Pre-revenue, deep losses
- eVTOL certification timelines frequently slip
- Stock down 43% from IPO — broken deal
- 5.3% Amazon stake is a 2021 venture bet, not a strategic commitment
- Sky-high valuation for pre-certification company
