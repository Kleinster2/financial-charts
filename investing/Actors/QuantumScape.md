## Commercial partnerships

### VW/PowerCo

| Deal | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2024 license | $130M | Technology access |
| 2025 milestones | $131M | Eagle line support |
| Total committed | $261M+ | Over 2 years |
| 2025 billings received | $19.5M | First cash inflows |

**Strategic:** VW/PowerCo gets early access for Scout, Audi, Porsche EVs. Management stated relationship is "as good as ever" despite external reports on VW battery funding changes.

### Other OEMs

- **Two new global automotive OEMs** added in 2025 (names not disclosed) — joint development and technology evaluation agreements
- Total OEM portfolio now includes VW/PowerCo + 2 unnamed majors
- Business model: **capital-light licensing** — QS provides technology blueprint, OEMs manufacture at their own facilities

### Supply chain ecosystem

| Partner | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Murata Manufacturing** | Ceramic separator production |
| **Corning** | Ceramic separator production |
| VW/PowerCo | Cell manufacturing, vehicle integration |

**Advantage:** Lithium-metal anode architecture requires no anode or graphite suppliers — sidesteps critical mineral supply chain constraints.

## Q4 / FY 2025 earnings (Feb 11, 2026)

**Still no GAAP revenue. First customer billings. Shares slipped post-report — no FY 2026 revenue guidance, no new OEM names disclosed.**

### Full year 2025

| Metric | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| GAAP revenue | $0 | $0 | — |
| Customer billings | **$19.5M** | $0 | First ever |
| GAAP net loss | $435.1M | — | — |
| GAAP operating expense | $472.6M | — | — |
| Adj. EBITDA loss | $252.3M | $285M | **-10% (improving)** |
| CapEx | $36.3M | — | Within guidance |
| Liquidity (year-end) | **$970.8M** | ~$900M | Solid |

**Note on billings:** The $19.5M in customer billings (from PowerCo/VW) is not GAAP revenue — it's reported to shareholders' equity due to related-party rules. This is essentially development/licensing cash from VW.

### Q4 2025

| Metric | Q4 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| GAAP net loss | $100.1M |
| Adj. EBITDA loss | $63.3M |
| CapEx | $12.3M |

### 2026 guidance

| Metric | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Adj. EBITDA loss | **$250-275M** (roughly flat YoY) |
| CapEx | $40-60M |
| Revenue guidance | **None provided** |
| New OEM names | **Not disclosed** |

**Market reaction:** Shares slipped on the lack of revenue guidance and no new OEM partnership details. CEO cited "ambitious goals to bring our revolutionary technology to market" without concrete KPIs.

### Cash runway

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Liquidity | $970.8M |
| Quarterly burn (adj.) | ~$63M |
| Implied runway | **~3.5-4 years** |

## Financial history

| Year | Revenue | Customer billings | Net loss | Adj. EBITDA loss |
|------|---------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 2024 | $0 | $0 | — | $285M |
| 2025 | $0 | $19.5M | $435M | $252M |
| 2026E | $0? | Growing | — | $250-275M |
| 2030E | ~$4B (bull case) | — | — | — |

## Stock performance

| Period | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| 2020 IPO/SPAC | Peaked ~$132 (Dec 2020) |
| 2021-2024 | Collapsed ~95% |
| Current (Feb 2026) | ~$7.73 |
| [[HSBC]] rating | Reduce (Jan 2026) |

**Volatility:** Trades on milestone news, not fundamentals. Stock slipped after Q4 2025 earnings on lack of revenue guidance.

## Competitive position

| Company | Status | Advantage |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **QuantumScape** | Eagle ramping | VW backing, Cobra tech |
| [[Donut Lab]] | [[Shipping]] Q1 2026 | First to market |
| [[ProLogium]] | Commercial 2026 | Mercedes backing |
| Solid Power | Behind schedule | [[Ford]]/[[BMW]] backing |
| SES AI | Hybrid approach | [[GM]]/[[Hyundai]] backing |

**Risk:** [[Donut Lab]] beat them to production.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- VW/PowerCo locked in ($261M+), relationship deepening
- COBRA enables capital-light licensing model — OEMs build, QS licenses
- Eagle Line inaugurated — tangible proof of manufacturing capability
- $971M liquidity = 3.5-4 year runway
- Murata + Corning supply chain partnerships de-risk ceramic separator scaling
- No graphite/anode supply chain dependency (lithium-metal architecture)
- Expanding TAM beyond EVs: data centers, robotics, aviation, defense
- Two new unnamed OEMs suggest broadening customer base
- $4B revenue potential by 2030 if licensing model scales

**Bear:**
- **Still $0 GAAP revenue after 15+ years** — no revenue guidance for 2026
- No OEM names disclosed beyond VW — trust-me narrative
- No public KPIs for 2026 goals
- $252M adjusted EBITDA loss in 2025, guided to $250-275M in 2026 (not improving)
- [[Donut Lab]], [[ProLogium]] ahead to market
- Stock down ~94% from all-time high ($132 → $7.73)
- VW's own battery strategy is evolving — partnership durability unclear
- Licensing model unproven — no OEM has built a QS-licensed factory yet
