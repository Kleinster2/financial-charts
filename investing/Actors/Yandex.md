**Yandex** — Former "Russian Google." Sanctioned after Ukraine invasion. Spun off [[Nebius]] (AI infra) as international entity. Russia business sold.

## Why Yandex matters (historical)

| Era | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Pre-2022 | Russia's largest tech company — search, cloud, autonomous vehicles |
| 2022 | Russia invades Ukraine, sanctions hit |
| 2023-24 | Restructuring — divest Russia, spin off international |
| 2024 | [[Nebius]] listed on NASDAQ (international AI infra) |
| 2024 | Russia business sold to local consortium |

## What Yandex was

| Business | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Search | 60%+ Russia market share |
| Advertising | Russian digital ads |
| Cloud | Yandex Cloud |
| Autonomous | Self-driving tech (now Avride in Nebius) |
| AI/ML | Strong research team |
| Ride-hailing | Yandex Taxi |

**Comparison:** Google + Uber + AWS for Russia.

---

## Post-sanctions restructuring

| Asset | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Russia search/ads/taxi | Sold to local buyers |
| AI infrastructure | → [[Nebius]] (NASDAQ: NBIS) |
| Autonomous driving | → Avride (within Nebius) |
| Data labeling | → Toloka (within Nebius) |

**Clean break:** International assets separated to be sanctions-compliant.

---

## Investment implication

**Yandex itself:** Not investable for US persons (sanctioned Russia).

**Nebius:** The investable successor — AI cloud infrastructure, NASDAQ-listed, no Russia exposure.

---

## Technical legacy

**Why Nebius inherited value:**
- Strong ML/AI research team
- Cloud infrastructure expertise
- Autonomous driving tech
- Data labeling platform (Toloka)

Yandex was legitimately strong in AI — that talent now powers Nebius.
