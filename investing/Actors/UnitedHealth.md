## Jan 27, 2026: Historic crash

**Stock fell ~20%** — from $352 to $285 — wiping ~$90B in market cap. Largest single-day decline in company history.

Part of sector-wide [[Medicare Advantage]] rate shock — see concept note for full policy context.

### Company-specific impact

**1. First revenue decline in 30+ years**
2026 guidance: ">$439B" revenue — roughly 2% below 2025, well under analyst expectations of $454B.

**2. Membership contraction**
Guiding for **[[3M]]+ member decline** in 2026 — exiting unprofitable MA and ACA exchange members.

**3. V28 coding transition**
Final year of Medicare's new diagnosis weighting system — $6B revenue hit ($2B UHC, $4B Optum).

### Drivers of revenue decline

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Divestitures ([[UK]], South America) | Revenue loss |
| Membership decline ([[3M]]+) | Volume loss |
| V28 coding transition | $6B hit |
| Chart review rule change | Structural |

### Strategic response

Management signaled aggressive cost-cutting — shedding unprofitable insurance members, selling medical clinics and provider assets. Prioritizing margins over growth.

## Business segments

| Segment | Revenue | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **UnitedHealthcare** | ~$280B | [[Insurance]] (employer, Medicare, Medicaid) |
| **Optum Health** | ~$100B | Care delivery, 90K+ physicians |
| **Optum Rx** | ~$120B | PBM, specialty pharmacy |
| **Optum Insight** | ~$15B | [[Healthcare]] analytics, IT |

Optum growing faster than insurance.

## Vertical integration

**Full healthcare stack:**
- [[Insurance]] (UnitedHealthcare)
- Care delivery (Optum Health physicians)
- Pharmacy benefits (Optum Rx)
- Data/analytics (Optum Insight)

Controversial but highly profitable.

## CEO transition

**Dec 2024 tragedy:**
- Brian Thompson (UnitedHealthcare CEO) killed
- Andrew Witty remains Group CEO
- Increased scrutiny on healthcare industry

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Scale advantages
- Optum diversification (growing faster than insurance)
- Cost-cutting could restore margins
- Beaten-down valuation after 2025-26 selloff

**Bear:**
- Medicare Advantage rate pressure (CMS flat rates for 2027)
- Chart review rule change eliminates diagnosis mining
- First revenue decline in 30 years
- Membership contraction ([[3M]]+ in 2026)
- V28 coding transition headwinds through 2026
- PBM scrutiny and vertical integration backlash
- Political/regulatory overhang post-Thompson tragedy
