## Financial performance

| Revenue growth | — | +27% | +2% |

## Brand portfolio

| Brand | Revenue (2024) | Growth | Positioning |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **ZEGNA** | €1,164M | +4.9% | Core luxury menswear |
| **Thom Browne** | €315M | **-16.8%** | American avant-garde |
| **TOM FORD FASHION** | ~€470M | **+33.5%** | Licensed brand, integration year |

**ZEGNA brand:** Steady growth, vertical integration (owns mills, manufacturing), strong DTC (78%).

**Thom Browne:** Acquired 2018, wholesale-heavy, underperforming. Organic growth -20.5%. The drag on results.

**TOM FORD FASHION:** Licensed from Estée Lauder in 2023 (Estée kept beauty). First full year. Strong growth but integration costs.

## Distribution

| Channel | % Revenue | Trend |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| DTC (retail + e-com) | 78% | Growing |
| Wholesale | 22% | Declining (deliberate) |

Heavy DTC mix is a strength — controls brand experience, captures full margin.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Cheapest Italian luxury (~10x adj. EBITDA vs 15-20x peers)
- ZEGNA brand growing, vertical integration = quality control
- Tom [[Ford]] Fashion adds growth vector
- 78% DTC = strong margin profile
- Family-controlled, long-term oriented
- 2027 target: €2.2-2.4B revenue, €250-300M adj. EBIT

**Bear:**
- Thom Browne -17% — acquisition not working
- Margins compressing (11.6% → 9.5%)
- Menswear = smaller TAM than broader luxury
- Tom [[Ford]] license risk (doesn't own brand)
- [[China]] ~30% of sales, exposed to weakness
- Stock down significantly since SPAC — broken deal
