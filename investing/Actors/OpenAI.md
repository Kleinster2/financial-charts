## Financial position (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation (Oct 2025) | $500B (restructuring) |
| **Valuation (Feb 2026)** | **$850B+** (post-money, new round) |
| Pre-money valuation | $730B |
| 2025 revenue (actual) | **$13.1B** (above $10B target) |
| 2025 cash burn (actual) | **$8B** (below $9B target) |
| **2030 revenue projection** | **$284B** (see segment breakdown below) |
| **2030 compute spend target** | **~$600B** (down from $1.4T) |
| Cumulative losses through 2028 | **$74B** |

*OpenAI revenue ambitions. Source: The Information.*

| Year | Total | Consumer (incl. ads) | B2B (agents, research) | Platform (API/Azure) | New products (hardware) |
|------|-------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 2023 | $1B | Dominant | Minimal | Small | — |
| 2024 | $4B | Dominant | Growing | Growing | — |
| 2025 | $13B | Dominant | Growing | Growing | — |
| 2026* | $30B | ~50%+ | Growing | Growing | — |
| 2027* | $62B | ~50%+ | Scaling | Scaling | — |
| 2028* | $113B | ~50% | Large | Large | Appears |
| 2029* | $184B | ~50% | Large | Large | Growing |
| 2030* | $284B | ~50%+ | Large | Large | Meaningful |

Key insight: **consumer stays dominant** through 2030. ChatGPT consumer (including ads) is ~50%+ of revenue even at $284B — this is an Instagram-scale consumer ads story, not enterprise SaaS. B2B (agents, research partnerships) grows fast but never overtakes consumer. "New products including hardware" appears 2028+ (rumored Jony Ive device). $284B would roughly match Google's current ad revenue.

Burning 14x more cash than [[Anthropic]]. Now surpassing [[SpaceX]] as most valuable private company.

### $100B+ mega-round (Feb 2026)

Largest private funding round in history (~90% strategic). Key investors: [[Amazon]] (up to $50B), [[SoftBank]] (~$30B), [[NVIDIA]] (up to $30B). $730B pre-money / $850B+ post-money. See **[[OpenAI Infrastructure Spend]]** for details.

**Tokenization:** [[Robinhood]] launched tokenized OpenAI shares in [[Europe]] (June 2025). OpenAI publicly did not endorse the move. See [[Tokenized private shares]].

## Cap table

### Ownership structure (Jan 2026)

| Owner | Stake | Value (at $500B) | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------|
| **Employees** | ~30% | ~$150B | Current + former staff |
| **[[Microsoft]]** | **27-30%** | **$135-150B** | $13.8B invested → ~10x |
| **[[OpenAI Foundation]]** | ~20-26% | ~$100-130B | Nonprofit, controls governance |

| **Other investors** | ~10% | ~$50B | Thrive, Khosla, MGX, etc. |

*Valuation: $500B (Oct 2025 restructuring). Total raised: ~$58B across 9 rounds.*

### Key investors

| Investor | Amount | Stake | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **[[Microsoft]]** | $13.8B | **~27-30%** | Was 32.5% pre-dilution, ~10x return |
| **[[SoftBank]]** | **$41B + ~$30B** | **~11%+** | $41B (Dec 2025) + ~$30B in Feb 2026 round |
| **[[Thrive Capital]]** | $1B+ | — | Led multiple rounds, Josh Kushner |
| **[[MGX]]** (Abu Dhabi) | — | — | Part of Middle East push |
| **[[Khosla Ventures]]** | — | — | Early investor ([[Vinod Khosla]]) |
| **[[a16z]]** | — | — | Early investor |
| **[[Sequoia Capital]]** | — | — | Multiple rounds |
| **[[Tiger Global]]** | — | — | Growth rounds |
| **[[NVIDIA]]** | $250M + ~$20B | — | $250M (Oct 2024) + ~$20B in Feb 2026 round |
| **T. Rowe Price** | — | — | Secondary purchases |
| **Dragoneer** | — | — | Secondary purchases |
| **[[Founders Fund]]** | — | — | Early investor |

**Power dynamics:**
- Microsoft has largest equity stake but SoftBank wrote largest check
- SoftBank paid ~$41B for 11% (~$373B implied valuation at entry) — got in before $500B mark
- Thrive, Khosla, a16z are early investors with smaller but high-multiple positions
- Employee equity pool is substantial (~30%) — retention tool

### Prior $50B Middle East round (Jan 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Raise | $50B+ |
| Valuation | $750-830B |
| Key investors | [[MGX]] (Abu Dhabi), other Gulf SWFs |
| Status | Superseded by $100B+ mega-round (Feb 2026) |

## Business model

- **ChatGPT** — [[Consumer]] subscription ($20-200/month)
- **API** — Developer access to GPT models
- **Enterprise** — ChatGPT for business

Revenue split unclear, but consumer-heavy (unlike Anthropic's 80% enterprise).

**[[Consumer]] device (announced Jan 23, 2026 at Davos):** OpenAI planning first-ever consumer hardware product for H2 2026. Chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane confirmed at Axios House Davos. No details on form factor — could be purpose-built AI companion device.

---

## Advertising (Jan 2026)

**ChatGPT getting ads** — first test in coming weeks.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tiers | Free users, new **$8/mo "Go" tier** |
| Format | Labeled boxes below chatbot answers |
| Example | [[Travel]] query → hotel ad below response |
| Key feature | **Conversational ads** — tap to chat with the ad |

**Sam Altman previously called ads "last resort"** — suggests revenue pressure mounting.

**[[Demis Hassabis]] response:** "I think those are tells. Actions speak louder than words." [[Google]] says no plans for [[Gemini]] app ads "at the moment" — will watch OpenAI's experiment.

---

## Competitive pressure

**[[Gemini]] gaining share:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Consumer AI]] usage | **22%** (Jan 2026) |
| Previous quarter | 13.5% |
| Growth | +63% QoQ |

ChatGPT still leads but gap shrinking. [[Google]] has distribution advantage (Search, Chrome, Android).

**[[Claude]] Code threat:** [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude]] Code getting more hype in agentic coding space. OpenAI lacks comparable offering.

**Skills platform threat (Feb 2026):** [[Anthropic]] launched Skills as an open standard — portable instruction packages that work across AI platforms. Partner directory ([[Asana]], [[Atlassian]], [[Canva]], [[Figma]], [[Sentry]], [[Zapier]]) with Skills API (`/v1/skills`). Competes directly with OpenAI's custom GPTs and agent SDK approach, but Anthropic's open-standard bet (same playbook as [[MCP]]) creates ecosystem gravity without platform lock-in. OpenAI's GPT Store has struggled with discovery and monetization; Skills could capture the developer workflow layer that custom GPTs missed.

**Switching costs:** Low. Memory/context could be moat but easily exportable ("print everything you know about me" → paste into competitor).

---

## Strategic dependencies

- **[[Microsoft]]** — $13.8B invested, **27% equity stake** (post-Oct 2025 restructuring)
- **Compute** — Massive Azure dependency ($250B contracted)
- **Distribution** — Bing, Office, Windows integration

**Oct 2025 restructuring changes:**
- Microsoft lost right of first refusal on compute
- Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently
- IP access extended through 2032
- OpenAI can work with other cloud providers

**Risk**: Microsoft building competing models (Maia chips, own AI team under Suleyman).

---

## Structure issues

- For-profit transition ongoing (from capped-profit)
- Sam Altman to receive equity (previously had none)
- Nonprofit board tension
- Employee equity concerns during transition

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Anthropic]] | Behind on efficiency, ahead on consumer |
| [[Google]] [[Gemini]] | Roughly par, [[Gemini]] catching up |
| Open source | Premium eroding (see [[Open source commoditization]]) |

---

## Infrastructure & compute spend

Compute spend target revised from $1.4T → **~$600B by 2030** (Feb 2026). $10B+ [[Cerebras]] inference deal. [[Stargate]] sites in UAE (1GW) and Texas. Exploring alternatives to [[NVIDIA]] for inference (~10% of compute). $100B+ mega-round closing Feb 2026 (~90% strategic investors). See **[[OpenAI Infrastructure Spend]]** for full details.

## Aardvark — security research agent (Feb 2026)

**Aardvark** is [[OpenAI]]'s AI-powered security research agent — the first product in its planned **Codex Security** suite. It uses frontier models to autonomously find security vulnerabilities in codebases.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Product type | Security research agent (automated vuln discovery) |
| Launch | ~Oct/Nov 2025 (private beta) |
| Status | **Expanding private beta** (Feb 2026) |
| Led by | [[Matt Knight]] (VP/CISO, first security hire — resigned Jan 2026 after launch) |
| Pricing | Not public (beta) |
| Branding | First "Codex Security" product |

**Key milestones:**
- Launched in private beta ~Q4 2025 under Matt Knight's security product team
- Feb 5, 2026 (GPT-5.3-Codex launch): OpenAI announced expanded Aardvark beta alongside "Trusted Access for Cyber" pilot and $10M API credits for OSS/critical infrastructure cyber defense
- Used to identify disclosed vulnerabilities in widely-used OSS projects (e.g., [[Next.js]])
- Knight resigned ~late Jan 2026, calling Aardvark "one of the most fulfilling chapters" — Sam Altman publicly credited him for the launch

**Strategic significance:**
- **Enterprise security push** — moves OpenAI beyond consumer chatbot and API into security tooling, a high-value enterprise vertical
- **Code generation → code security pipeline** — LLMs generate more code, creating more vulnerabilities; OpenAI is trying to own both sides of the equation
- **Early mover among AI labs** — [[Anthropic]] launched Claude Code "security review" command + GitHub Action; [[AWS]] built security agents; but all described as "demoware" by industry analysts (Boring AppSec, Jan 2026)

**Competitive landscape:**

| Competitor | Product | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| [[Snyk]] | SAST/SCA platform | Established, thriving despite GHAS |
| [[Semgrep]] | Code analysis | Growing, strong OSS community |
| [[GitHub]] (GHAS) | GitHub Advanced Security | Native to 100M+ dev workflow |
| [[Anthropic]] | Claude Code security review | Launched but stagnant (no updates in 5 months) |
| [[AWS]] | Security Agent | Underwhelming (checks only 11 controls) |

**Industry view (Boring AppSec, Jan 2026):** Most lab security products are "demoware" — demonstrating capability rather than building world-class AppSec tools. But labs are getting serious: Anthropic hired a [[SentinelOne]] executive for cybersecurity products; OpenAI has dedicated researchers on Aardvark. History suggests both platform and point solutions survive (cf. GuardDuty vs [[Wiz]]).

## Peter Steinberger hire & OpenClaw foundation (Feb 15, 2026)

**[[Peter Steinberger]]** — creator of [[OpenClaw]] and founder of [[PSPDFKit]] — joining OpenAI to "drive the next generation of personal agents."

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | Personal agents lead |
| Background | Founded [[PSPDFKit]] (bootstrapped 13 years, $116M raise, ~1B users), created [[OpenClaw]] (100K+ GitHub stars) |
| Altman quote | "A genius with amazing ideas about smart agents interacting with each other" |
| Impact | "We expect this will quickly become core to our product offerings" |

**[[OpenClaw]] → foundation:** Altman announced OpenClaw will become an independent open-source foundation with continued OpenAI support. "The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that."

**Strategic read:** This is OpenAI's answer to [[Anthropic]]'s [[MCP]]/[[Skills]] open-standard strategy. Both labs now backing open agent infrastructure to build ecosystem gravity. OpenAI gets Steinberger's agent expertise + open-source community goodwill; the foundation structure prevents lock-in accusations.

---

## Key risks

- **Cash burn** — $74B losses before profitability
- **Microsoft dependency** — Not independent
- **Commoditization** — Open source closing gap
- **Regulatory** — Antitrust, safety regulations
- **Talent exodus** — Key researchers leaving
- **Structure transition** — Nonprofit to for-profit messy
- **Execution variance** — UAE site ahead of Texas

---

## For theses

**Bearish**: See [[Model lab economics]] — not investable until path to profitability clears.

## February 2026: India market dominance

At the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]] (Feb 16–20), [[Sam Altman]] revealed [[India]] has **100M+ weekly active [[ChatGPT]] users** — second only to the US and up from 72M+ daily in late 2025. [[India]] is also [[OpenAI]]'s largest student user base globally. US AI labs are racing for Indian users and training data via free tiers, with no major domestic chatbot rival yet.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| India WAU | 100M+ (Feb 2026, per [[Sam Altman]]) |
| Global rank | #2 after US |
| Student users | Largest globally |
