## Relevance to AI Race

OpenAI is the most prominent AI lab but also the most aggressive spender. The question: can they reach profitability before burning through capital?

## Business model

- **ChatGPT** — Consumer subscription ($20-200/month)
- **API** — Developer access to GPT models
- **Enterprise** — ChatGPT for business

Revenue split unclear, but consumer-heavy (unlike Anthropic's 80% enterprise).

---

## Strategic dependencies

- **[[Microsoft]]** — $13B+ invested, owns 49% of profits (capped)
- **Compute** — Massive Azure dependency
- **Distribution** — Bing, Office, Windows integration

**Risk**: Microsoft could build competing models, reduce dependency.

---

## Structure issues

- For-profit transition ongoing (from capped-profit)
- Sam Altman to receive equity (previously had none)
- Nonprofit board tension
- Employee equity concerns during transition

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Anthropic]] | Behind on efficiency, ahead on consumer |
| Google Gemini | Roughly par, Gemini catching up |
| Open source | Premium eroding (see [[Open source commoditization]]) |

---

## Key risks

- **Cash burn** — $74B losses before profitability
- **Microsoft dependency** — Not independent
- **Commoditization** — Open source closing gap
- **Regulatory** — Antitrust, safety regulations
- **Talent exodus** — Key researchers leaving
- **Structure transition** — Nonprofit to for-profit messy

---

## For theses

**Bearish**: See [[Model lab economics]] — not investable until path to profitability clears.
