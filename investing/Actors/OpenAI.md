**OpenAI** — Frontier AI lab, creator of GPT series, ChatGPT. Microsoft partner.

---

## Relevance to AI Race

OpenAI is the most prominent AI lab but also the most aggressive spender. The question: can they reach profitability before burning through capital?

---

## Financial position (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $13B annualized |
| Burn rate | 57% of revenue |
| Cumulative losses through 2028 | **$74B** |
| Profitability target | **2030** |
| Seeking valuation | **$750-830B** (Jan 2026 round) |
| Previous valuation | $157B (Oct 2024 round) |

Burning 14x more cash than [[Anthropic]]. Now surpassing SpaceX as most valuable private company.

**CFO argument (Jan 2026):** Sarah Frier published blog claiming revenue tracks compute 1:1 — 10x revenue growth (2023-2025) alongside 9.5x compute growth. Implies more capital = more revenue.

**Tokenization:** Robinhood launched tokenized OpenAI shares in Europe (June 2025). OpenAI publicly did not endorse the move. See [[Tokenized private shares]].

## Cap table

### Key investors

| Investor | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **[[Microsoft]]** | $13B+ | 49% of profits (capped), Azure compute |
| **SoftBank** | $500M+ | Part of $6.6B round (Oct 2024) |
| **Thrive Capital** | $1B+ | Led $6.6B round, multiple rounds |
| **Khosla Ventures** | — | Early investor (Vinod Khosla) |
| **a16z** | — | Early investor |
| **Sequoia Capital** | — | Multiple rounds |
| **Tiger Global** | — | Growth rounds |
| **Founders Fund** | — | Early investor |
| **Reid Hoffman** | — | LinkedIn founder, board member |
| **Infosys** | — | Strategic investor |
| **NVIDIA** | $250M | Oct 2024 round |
| **Apple** | — | Rumored Oct 2024 |

**Total raised:** $17B+

**Notable:** Microsoft dominates cap table. Most VCs are passive — Microsoft controls the relationship.

### $50B Middle East round (Jan 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target raise | **$50B+** |
| Target valuation | $750-830B |
| Key investors | [[MGX]] (Abu Dhabi), other Gulf SWFs |
| Status | Sam Altman touring Middle East (Jan 2026) |

**Bull case:** Revenue tracks compute — more capital = more revenue growth.

**Bear case:** Gulf States are "final boss" of fundraising. After this, only public markets remain. Unclear how many more mega-rounds possible before profitability required.

---

## Business model

- **ChatGPT** — Consumer subscription ($20-200/month)
- **API** — Developer access to GPT models
- **Enterprise** — ChatGPT for business

Revenue split unclear, but consumer-heavy (unlike Anthropic's 80% enterprise).

**Consumer device (announced Jan 23, 2026 at Davos):** OpenAI planning first-ever consumer hardware product for H2 2026. Chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane confirmed at Axios House Davos. No details on form factor — could be purpose-built AI companion device.

---

## Advertising (Jan 2026)

**ChatGPT getting ads** — first test in coming weeks.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tiers | Free users, new **$8/mo "Go" tier** |
| Format | Labeled boxes below chatbot answers |
| Example | Travel query → hotel ad below response |
| Key feature | **Conversational ads** — tap to chat with the ad |

**Sam Altman previously called ads "last resort"** — suggests revenue pressure mounting.

**Demis Hassabis response:** "I think those are tells. Actions speak louder than words." Google says no plans for Gemini app ads "at the moment" — will watch OpenAI's experiment.

---

## Competitive pressure

**Gemini gaining share:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consumer AI usage | **22%** (Jan 2026) |
| Previous quarter | 13.5% |
| Growth | +63% QoQ |

ChatGPT still leads but gap shrinking. Google has distribution advantage (Search, Chrome, Android).

**Claude Code threat:** [[Anthropic]]'s Claude Code getting more hype in agentic coding space. OpenAI lacks comparable offering.

**Switching costs:** Low. Memory/context could be moat but easily exportable ("print everything you know about me" → paste into competitor).

---

## Strategic dependencies

- **[[Microsoft]]** — $13B+ invested, owns 49% of profits (capped)
- **Compute** — Massive Azure dependency
- **Distribution** — Bing, Office, Windows integration

**Risk**: Microsoft could build competing models, reduce dependency.

---

## Structure issues

- For-profit transition ongoing (from capped-profit)
- Sam Altman to receive equity (previously had none)
- Nonprofit board tension
- Employee equity concerns during transition

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Anthropic]] | Behind on efficiency, ahead on consumer |
| Google Gemini | Roughly par, Gemini catching up |
| Open source | Premium eroding (see [[Open source commoditization]]) |

---

## Cerebras compute deal (Jan 14, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deal value | **$10B+** |
| Compute | 750 MW |
| Duration | 2026-2028 |
| Use case | Inference (especially coding) |

**Why Cerebras:**
- 15x faster responses than GPU-based systems
- Sam Altman was early Cerebras investor
- Diversifies away from NVIDIA/Microsoft dependency

**Cerebras CEO:** "Largest high-speed AI inference deployment in the world."

---

## Stargate infrastructure

**UAE Stargate (per SemiAnalysis, Jan 2026):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | UAE |
| Power source | 4x Ansaldo Energia AE94.3 gas turbines |
| Gross capacity | 1.3GW |
| Derated capacity | **1GW** (desert heat penalty -23%) |
| Phase 1 | 200MW by YE2026 |
| Status | "Going well" |

**Key insight:** On-site gas turbines = BYOP (Bring Your Own Power). Desert heat derates capacity by 23%.

**Texas Abilene (contrast):** "GPUs not going BRRR" — UAE progressing faster than domestic site.

**Turbine supplier:** [[Ansaldo Energia]] (Italian)

---

## Key risks

- **Cash burn** — $74B losses before profitability
- **Microsoft dependency** — Not independent
- **Commoditization** — Open source closing gap
- **Regulatory** — Antitrust, safety regulations
- **Talent exodus** — Key researchers leaving
- **Structure transition** — Nonprofit to for-profit messy
- **Execution variance** — UAE site ahead of Texas

---

## For theses

**Bearish**: See [[Model lab economics]] — not investable until path to profitability clears.

| [[Sam Altman]] | CEO |
| [[Kevin Weil]] | CPO (joined 2024, ex-Twitter/Instagram) |
| Fidji Simo | Executive (Zoph reports to her) |

## Thinking Machines Lab re-hires (Jan 2026)

**Three founding team members returned from [[Thinking Machines Lab]]:**

| Person | TML Role | OpenAI Role |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Barret Zoph | CTO | Reports to Fidji Simo |

| Sam Schoenholz | Founding team | Researcher |

All three had previously worked at OpenAI before joining Murati's startup.
