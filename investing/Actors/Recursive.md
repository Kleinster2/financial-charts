## Mission

Develop **superintelligent AI** that can improve itself over time without needing feedback from humans.

This positions Recursive alongside [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], and [[Meta]]'s AI efforts in pursuing AGI/superintelligence — though with a specific focus on recursive self-improvement (hence the name).

## Competitive landscape

| Lab | Valuation | Focus | Key backers |
|-----|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [[OpenAI]] | ~$150B | AGI, consumer AI | [[Microsoft]], [[SoftBank]] |
| [[Anthropic]] | ~$60B | AI safety, Claude | [[Google]], [[Amazon]] |
| [[xAI]] | ~$50B | Grok, truth-seeking AI | Private |
| **Recursive** | ~$4B | Self-improving AI | GV, Greycroft |

## Notable

**GV leading the round** — Google Ventures backing a potential competitor to Google's own Gemini/[[DeepMind]] efforts. Shows continued VC appetite for frontier AI labs despite concentration at top players.

**Socher's multi-hat approach** — Unusual to launch a $4B AI lab while remaining CEO of another AI company (You.com). Could signal You.com pivots to applications while Recursive focuses on foundational research.
