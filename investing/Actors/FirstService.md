# FirstService

North America's largest residential property manager and essential property services platform. Two segments: FirstService Residential (HOA/condo/co-op management, ~8,500+ communities) and FirstService Brands (restoration, roofing, fire protection, [[California Closets]], painting). ~$5.2B revenue, ~$7B market cap. Classic roll-up model — acquires in fragmented markets at ~4.5x normalized EBITDA, then consolidates with tuck-unders. Spun off from old FirstService in 2015 (the parent renamed itself to [[Colliers]]).

## Investment case

Bull:
- Residential segment is recurring-revenue, capital-light, recession-resilient
- Roll-up model in deeply fragmented markets — long acquisition runway
- Disciplined acquirer at ~4.5x EBITDA — proven track record since 1989
- Revenue compounding at 15-20% annually with mix of organic + M&A
- Moderate leverage (2.0x net debt/EBITDA) with $318M free cash flow
- Brands segment benefits from climate-driven restoration demand

Bear:
- P/E at ~48x trailing — priced for execution perfection
- Net income declining despite revenue growth (interest expense drag)
- Roll-up risk — integration complexity increases with scale
- Residential segment growth limited by organic pricing + community count
- Roofing Corp of America integration still early (acquired Dec 2023)
- Founder [[Jay Hennick]] splits attention between FSV and [[Colliers]]
