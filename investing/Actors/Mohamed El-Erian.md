## Current views (2026)

**On Fed independence (Jan 2026):**

| Point | El-Erian view |
|-------|---------------|
| Trump-Powell | "Inevitable step of a feud that's been going on for seven years" |
| DOJ investigation | "Major escalation from both sides" |
| Off-ramp | "Hard to find... I don't see it as yet" |
| Market calm | New chair "will need time to impose their authority" |

**On global positioning:**
> "The rest of the world is overweight the U.S... The U.S. is perceived not as pristine but as the cleanest dirty shirt. If the U.S. starts eroding its standing in the global economy, then the rest of the world will look to reduce its overweight."

**On gold:** Rising price indicates "at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."
