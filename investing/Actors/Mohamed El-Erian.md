## Current views (2026)

**On [[Fed independence]] (Jan 2026):**

| Point | El-Erian view |
|-------|---------------|
| Trump-Powell | "Inevitable step of a feud that's been going on for seven years" |
| DOJ investigation | "Major escalation from both sides" |
| Off-ramp | "Hard to find... I don't see it as yet" |
| Market calm | New chair "will need time to impose their authority" |

**On global positioning:**
> "The rest of the world is overweight the U.S... The U.S. is perceived not as pristine but as the cleanest dirty shirt. If the U.S. starts eroding its standing in the global economy, then the rest of the world will look to reduce its overweight."

**On gold:** Rising price indicates "at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

**On [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] (Feb 19, 2026):**

Posted on X after Blue Owl permanently halted OBDC II redemptions. Direct quotes (via CNBCTV18, NYT):

> *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?"*

Key points from his commentary:
- Private credit boom in developed markets may have gone "too far overall"
- Warned of a "market for lemons" problem — weaker assets become indistinguishable from stronger ones during stress
- Called valuation adjustments the "elephant in the room" — a "significant and necessary valuation hit" could be looming
- Firms differ in structure and risk management, but sector-wide contagion risk is real
- Clarified current risks "nowhere near" 2008 scale
- Said he would share more thoughts in due course

NYT: Blue Owl's redemption change "reminded him of the beginnings of the financial crisis when banks sought to contain damage from souring mortgage loans."

The comparison landed: alt managers sold off 4-9% across the board on Feb 19.
