## AgiBot Night 2026

Hosted a 60-minute live-streamed gala during [[China]]'s Spring Festival — billed as the **world's first large-scale entertainment event where humanoid robots served as primary performers** (not props). 200+ robots deployed across Tai Chi, drunken fist, dance, magic, and comedy.

Models featured: Lingxi X2 (synchronized dance), Expedition A2 (presentations — previously completed a 106km autonomous trek from Suzhou to Shanghai), Industrial G2 (force-controlled dance with humans), D1 quadruped.

**Elf Xuan** (by AheadForm, developer [[Yuhang Hu]]): Hyper-realistic bionic robot with 42 independent facial motors, emotional expressions in a musical segment.

Strategic context: Response to industry skepticism about whether humanoid robotics prioritizes marketing over industrial utility. Rumored 2026 Hong Kong IPO. See [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]].

## Competitive position

| vs. Others | AGIBOT |
|------------|--------|
| [[Unitree]] | Less mass-market focus |
| [[Boston Dynamics]] | Behind on capability |

- Rapid iteration capability
- 5,000+ units shipped by end 2025
- Hong Kong IPO candidate (2026)

**Bear:**
- Private, limited access
- US-[[China]] tensions (export risk)
- Technology gap vs. leaders
- Crowded [[China]] market
- "Bubble" concerns — gala showmanship vs. industrial revenue
