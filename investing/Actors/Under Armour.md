## Restructuring strategy (Kevin Plank 2.0)

Plank's return marked a strategic reset away from volume-driven discounting:

- Eliminating ~25% of product lines
- Exiting off-price and discount channels
- Refocusing on training, running, team sports
- Shifting toward higher price points and premium positioning
- $500M three-year share buyback program (18M shares / $115M repurchased through Sep 2025)

Plank has described the "most disruptive phase" of the reset as complete. Adjusted EPS guidance raised to $0.10-0.11 (from $0.03-0.05) for FY26, suggesting margin improvement despite revenue decline.

| North America | High single-digit decline |
| Asia-Pacific | High single-digit decline |

## Tariff exposure

Plank estimated ~$100M in additional costs from tariffs in FY26. Combined with soft demand, this is expected to roughly halve adjusted operating income vs FY25.
