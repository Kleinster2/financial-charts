## Investment relevance

**Why Bradesco matters:**

1. **Value trap or opportunity?** — 70% decline, profits growing. Classic turnaround setup if digital transformation works.

2. **Fintech pressure** — Most exposed of big banks to [[Nubank]]/[[Pix]] disruption.

3. **Insurance optionality** — Bradesco Seguros is valuable, possibly underappreciated.

4. **Credit risk** — Aggressive SME/rural lending in high-rate environment.

5. **Rate sensitivity** — High Selic helps NIM but hurts borrowers.
