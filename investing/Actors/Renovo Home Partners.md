**Renovo Home Partners** — Home improvement company. Declared bankruptcy in **November 2025**, one month after its primary lender [[BlackRock]] had marked the value of Renovo's debt at **100 cents on the dollar** — indicating a loan in perfect health. The company was already failing to make interest payments. BlackRock prepared to book a **total loss** on its $150M loan.

The case became an emblematic example of [[Private credit]] valuation opacity: quarterly marks by the lender who holds the debt can completely miss deteriorating fundamentals.
