## What It Tracks

Investment grade US corporate bonds (BBB- and above). Mix of interest rate risk (long duration) and credit spread risk. More rate-sensitive than [[HYG]] due to longer duration.

## Use Case

[[Investment grade bonds]] proxy. LQD vs [[HYG]] spread = credit quality premium. LQD vs [[TLT]] spread = corporate credit spread over Treasuries.
