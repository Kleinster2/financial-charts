## Why Lumentum matters

Lumentum has the only 200Gbps EML at scale — essential for next-gen AI connectivity:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key advantage | 200Gbps EML (only at scale) |
| Products | Lasers, ROADMs, optical switches |
| AI exposure | High-speed transceivers |
| Differentiation | EML technology lead |

## EML advantage

**What's an EML?**
- Electro-absorption Modulated Laser
- Combines laser + modulator in one chip
- Higher speed, lower power than alternatives
- Critical for 800G+ transceivers

**Lumentum's lead:**
- Only 200Gbps EML shipping at scale
- 2+ year technology lead
- Enables 1.6T transceivers (8x200G)
- Supply constrained

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| **Datacom lasers** | EMLs, VCSELs |
| **ROADMs** | Reconfigurable optical switches |
| **3D sensing** | Consumer electronics |
| **Telecom** | Coherent components |

**AI focus:** High-speed lasers for data center interconnects.

## 800G/1.6T opportunity

**Transceiver architecture:**
- 800G = 8 lanes × 100G (or 4 × 200G)
- 1.6T = 8 lanes × 200G
- 200G EML enables efficient 1.6T
- Lumentum = key bottleneck supplier

**Customer base:**
- Transceiver makers ([[Coherent]], etc.)
- Hyperscalers directly
- Network equipment OEMs

---

## Optical switching

**Beyond lasers:**
- ROADM technology
- Data center optical switching
- Programmable optical networks
- Growing AI relevance

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Segment | Lumentum vs |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| [[Coherent]] | Full modules | Component supplier |
| Broadcom | Silicon photonics | Traditional optical |
| II-VI/Coherent | Lasers | EML lead |
| Source Photonics | Transceivers | Component supplier |

EML technology leadership = differentiated position.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 200G EML monopoly (at scale)
- 1.6T transceiver enabler
- AI bandwidth demand
- Technology lead sustainable
- Supply constrained

**Bear:**
- Customer concentration
- 3D sensing headwinds
- Cyclical optical market
- Competition eventually catches up
- Consumer segment drag
