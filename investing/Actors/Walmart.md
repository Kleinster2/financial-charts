**FY2027 guidance disappoints:** Net sales +3.5-4.5%, adj EPS $2.75-2.85 (vs Street $2.96). Stock +2% on Q4 beat but guidance miss may cap upside.

**Milestone:** [[Amazon]] overtook Walmart as largest company by annual revenue ($716.9B vs $713.2B). Not apples-to-apples (AWS/cloud included) but symbolically significant.

**CFO Rainey:** Higher-income households driving share gains. Fashion category growth almost entirely from $100K+ households. Tariff impact largely absorbed — inflation at Walmart US just above 1%.

Key dynamics:
- E-commerce +27% last Q (store-fulfilled pickup/delivery, marketplace expansion)
- Higher-margin streams accelerating: advertising revenue, Walmart+ membership, retail media
- Grocery + health & wellness driving traffic across income cohorts
- International strength: [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[India]] (constant-currency)
- Risks: tariff-related costs, higher claims expenses, category mix headwinds from grocery/consumables

**Valuation:** Forward P/E 45.3x vs industry avg 41.2x. Premium to [[Kroger]] (13.4x) and [[Target]] (14.9x), below [[Costco]] (48.4x). Market re-rating Walmart as a tech-enabled retail platform — but elevated multiple leaves little room for missteps.

**Stock:** $133.89, +29% YoY — outpacing S&P 500 (+13.9%), [[Kroger]] (+9.2%), [[Costco]] (-3.9%), [[Target]] (-11.1%). EPS consensus rising from $2.15 (2022) → $2.94 (2025E) → $3.29 (2027E).
