**Jensen Huang** — NVIDIA founder/CEO. Most powerful person in semiconductors. "Leather jacket diplomacy."

---

## Why Jensen matters

Jensen doesn't just run NVIDIA — he shapes the AI hardware landscape:

| Influence | How |
|-----------|-----|
| NVIDIA strategy | Founder control, long-term vision |
| Acquisition strategy | Mellanox, ARM (failed), Run:AI, SchedMD, Groq |
| Industry relationships | TSMC capacity locks, hyperscaler deals |
| Political navigation | [[China]]/US, export controls |

---

## Leadership style

- **Founder-CEO since 1993** — 30+ years
- **"Leather jacket"** — signature look, personal brand
- **Technical depth** — still reviews product details
- **Long-term thinking** — CUDA investment started 2006

**Contrast with peers:**
- More technical than most big tech CEOs
- Less political than Musk/Altman
- Lets products speak

---

## Strategic moves

**Acquisition pattern:**
| [[Target]] | Year | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Mellanox | 2019 | Networking for AI clusters |
| ARM | 2020 | Failed — regulatory block |
| Run:AI | 2024 | Kubernetes orchestration |
| SchedMD | 2025 | SLURM workload manager |
| [[Groq]] | 2025 | Inference chips, $20B |

**Pattern:** Buy infrastructure that competitors depend on. Raise switching costs beyond CUDA.

---

## TSMC relationship

- NVIDIA is TSMC's largest customer (or \#2 after [[Apple]])
- Jensen personally negotiates capacity
- Locked N3/N2 capacity years ahead
- Forces AMD to secondary slots

See [[NVIDIA]] for manufacturing details.

---

## [[China]] navigation

**Before export controls:** 95% [[China]] AI chip share
**After controls:** Created H800/A800 compliance chips
**H200 approval (Dec 2025):** Lobbied successfully

Jensen walks the line — maintains US government relations while preserving [[China]] optionality.

## Groq acquisition (Dec 2025)

- $20B deal — 3X September valuation
- Non-exclusive licensing (Groq operates independently)
- Strategic hedge against [[HBM]] prices (Groq uses SRAM)
- Political angle: Sacks promoted Groq, deal followed policy wins

See [[Groq]] for details.

---

## Compensation / Ownership

- Significant NVIDIA stake
- One of world's richest (fluctuates with NVDA)
- Unlike Musk, doesn't do controversial public statements
- Insider selling noted ($496M in 90 days, Nov 2025)

---

## [[Taiwan]] connection

- Born in [[Taiwan]] (Tainan)
- Emigrated to US as child
- Personal relationships with TSMC leadership
- Symbolic for [[Taiwan]] tech ecosystem

---

## Risks / Considerations

- NVIDIA valuation depends on Jensen's vision
- Succession unclear (no obvious \#2)
- Age 61 — likely decade+ more, but not forever
- Insider selling at highs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | NVIDIA founder/CEO |
