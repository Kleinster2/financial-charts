## Construction history

### The air rights deal (1990)

When Investcorp acquired Saks in 1990, they monetized the flagship's unused development rights:

| Component | What happened |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Air rights** | Sold to tower developer |
| **Tower** | 36-story office building built behind store |
| **Saks space** | Retained ~80,000 sq ft in tower for retail expansion |
| **Separate ownership** | Tower and store became distinct assets |

This created the unusual situation where the Saks flagship ([[611 Fifth Avenue]]) and the tower behind it ([[623 Fifth Avenue]]) have different owners.

## Ownership timeline

| Period | Owner | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 1990-? | Developer | Original construction |
| ?-2025 | [[Cohen Brothers Realty]] | Current owner |
| 2025- | [[Vornado Realty Trust]] | Acquiring for $218M |

## The Vornado acquisition (2025)

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Price | $218M |
| Buyer | [[Vornado Realty Trust]] |
| Seller | [[Cohen Brothers Realty]] |
| Context | [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] recovery |

**Strategic fit:** Vornado already owns significant Fifth Avenue real estate, including retail at 640 Fifth Avenue. This acquisition consolidates their corridor presence.

## Relationship to Saks flagship

| Building | Owner | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| [[611 Fifth Avenue]] (1924 store) | [[Saks Global]] / HBC | Retail flagship |
| [[623 Fifth Avenue]] (1990 tower) | [[Cohen Brothers Realty]] → [[Vornado Realty Trust]] | Office + Saks overflow |

**The complication:** While Saks occupies ~80,000 sq ft in the tower, they don't own it. The tower sale to Vornado doesn't affect Saks's lease position but does change their landlord for that portion of their space.
