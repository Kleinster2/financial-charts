## SpaceX token

**Flagship tokenized offering:**
- Token mirrors performance of SpaceX private shares
- Retail can gain exposure without accredited status
- Not actual SpaceX equity — derivative instrument
- SpaceX did not issue or endorse

**Structure:**
- Republic acquires SpaceX shares
- Issues tokens representing exposure
- Tokens tradeable on Republic platform
- Should converge at liquidity event (IPO)

See [[Tokenized private shares]] for risks and context.

## Regulatory framework

**Using existing exemptions:**
