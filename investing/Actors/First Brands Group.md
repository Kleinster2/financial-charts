**First Brands Group** — Ohio-based manufacturer of replacement auto parts. Built through a 10-year debt-fueled acquisition spree, collapsed into **Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 28, 2025** owing roughly **$10 billion** to creditors. Federal prosecutors alleged fraud. Lenders included [[Jefferies]] and [[UBS]], both of which suffered significant losses.

[[Jamie Dimon]] used First Brands as the occasion for his "cockroaches" warning — if you spot one in a lending book, there are probably more.

## Why it matters

First Brands is the poster child for [[Private credit]] excess: an obscure, private company accumulated $10B in debt from institutional lenders who failed to catch the fraud. It exposed how stiff competition for deals and FOMO-driven lending can lead to skipped diligence. Holders of senior debt didn't know the full extent of borrowing until the bankruptcy filing.
