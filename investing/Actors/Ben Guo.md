## Positioning on OpenClaw

From LinkedIn post during the [[Clawdbot viral growth]] chaos:

> "Clawdbot is the homebrew version of Zo. The clear latent demand for this shape of product – AI with a computer – only makes me more convinced about our roadmap."

> "Zo gives you a managed server, friendly UI, and tons of built-in integrations. I think this will always be the better choice for most people. Of course, motivated technical people will always enjoy the more DIY option."

**Vision**: "Personal AWS" — or as he puts it, **"AWS for your mom."**

## Building in public

Active on X (@0thernet), sharing Zo experiments:
- Running Zo agents with 5-minute heartbeats overnight
- Agents autonomously signing up for "moltbook" (AI social network)
- Agents replacing their own Soul documents with nested folders
- Wrote manifesto about "soft recursive self-improvement"

Called his autonomous agent "my AI pet."
