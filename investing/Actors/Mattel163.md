## Context

Mattel is investing heavily in digital gaming after watching [[Hasbro]]'s Wizards of the Coast/digital segment deliver 86% revenue growth and 45% margins. Full ownership of Mattel163 gives Mattel direct control over mobile game development, monetization, and first-party data — critical for the IP-to-digital pipeline.
