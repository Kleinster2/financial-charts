**OPEC** — Oil cartel controlling ~40% of global production. OPEC+ includes Russia and allies (~55% of global). Sets production quotas to manage prices.

## Why OPEC matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Members | 12 countries |
| Production | ~27M bpd (OPEC), ~42M bpd (OPEC+) |
| Reserves | ~80% of global proven reserves |
| Headquarters | Vienna, Austria |

## How OPEC moves markets

| Action | Oil price impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Production cuts | Prices rise |
| Production increases | Prices fall |
| Quota cheating | Undermines cuts |
| Spare capacity signals | Caps upside |

**Saudi role:** Swing producer with 2-3M bpd spare capacity. Can flood or restrict market.

---

## Venezuela context

**Venezuela in OPEC:**
- Founding member (1960)
- Largest reserves (303B barrels)
- Production collapsed: 3M bpd (2000s) → ~1M bpd (now)
- Effectively suspended due to non-compliance

**Post-Maduro implications:**
- If US rebuilds Venezuela production → more global supply
- Could pressure OPEC to cut elsewhere
- Venezuela unlikely to rejoin cartel under US control
- Net bearish for oil prices long-term

See [[Venezuela oil rebuild]] and [[Monroe Doctrine]].

## OPEC+ dynamics

**Saudi-Russia alliance (2016+):**
- Coordinates cuts between OPEC and non-OPEC
- Fragile — competing interests
- Russia often cheats on quotas
- Ukraine war strained but didn't break alliance

**Tensions:**
- UAE wants higher quota
- Iraq chronic overproducer
- African members struggling
- US shale complicates cuts (fills any gap)

---

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| OPEC cuts hold | Oil prices supported, energy stocks up |
| OPEC cuts fail | Prices fall, high-cost producers hurt |
| Venezuela returns | More supply, bearish prices |
| Saudi-Russia split | Price volatility |

**Key indicator:** Monthly OPEC+ meetings and quota compliance data.

## Price targets

OPEC broadly targets $80-90 Brent to:
- Fund Saudi Vision 2030
- Support Russian budget
- Not destroy demand

Current prices (~$60s) below target — pressure to cut.
