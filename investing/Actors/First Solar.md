**First Solar** — Only major US solar panel manufacturer. Thin-film CdTe technology. Beneficiary of IRA and China tariffs.

---

## Why First Solar matters

First Solar is the only US-headquartered solar manufacturer at scale:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #1 US solar manufacturer |
| Technology | Thin-film CdTe (not silicon) |
| Manufacturing | US, Malaysia, Vietnam, India |
| Policy tailwind | IRA domestic content, China tariffs |

---

## Technology differentiation

**Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) thin-film:**
- Different from Chinese crystalline silicon
- Better hot-climate performance
- Lower temperature coefficient
- Vertically integrated manufacturing

**Vs Chinese silicon panels:**
| Aspect | First Solar | Chinese silicon |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Technology | Thin-film CdTe | Crystalline Si |
| Efficiency | Lower (but improving) | Higher |
| Hot climate | Better | Degrades more |
| Supply chain | US/allied | China-dependent |

---

## AI data center opportunity

**Why data centers choose First Solar:**
- Domestic content for IRA credits
- Avoids China tariff/ban risk
- Utility-scale focus
- Reliable supply

**Hyperscaler demand:**
- Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta all buying solar
- 98.7% of corporate PPAs from hyperscalers
- First Solar = preferred domestic supplier

## Manufacturing footprint

| Location | Capacity |
|----------|----------|
| Ohio (multiple) | ~6 GW |
| Alabama | Expanding |
| Louisiana | New facility |
| Malaysia | ~3 GW |
| Vietnam | ~3 GW |
| India | ~3 GW |

**US expansion:** IRA incentives driving domestic buildout.

---

## Policy tailwinds

**Inflation Reduction Act (IRA):**
- Domestic content bonuses
- Manufacturing tax credits
- 10-year visibility

**China tariffs:**
- AD/CVD duties on Chinese panels
- Southeast Asia circumvention crackdown
- First Solar exempt (CdTe, not silicon)

---

## Critical minerals exposure

First Solar uses tellurium, not rare earths — different risk profile:

| Material | Use | Supply chain |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Tellurium | CdTe thin-film | China ~60% refining |
| Cadmium | CdTe thin-film | Byproduct of zinc |

**Better positioned than silicon solar**:
- Rare earth magnets not required (no motors)
- Tellurium not on China's 2025 export control list
- But still some China supply chain exposure

**Vs Chinese silicon panels**:
- Chinese panels require rare earths (inverters, trackers)
- First Solar's vertically integrated manufacturing reduces touchpoints
- IRA domestic content requirements favor US supply chains

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only US solar manufacturer at scale
- IRA domestic content tailwind
- China tariff beneficiary
- AI data center demand
- Contracted backlog visibility
- Less rare earth exposed than silicon solar

**Bear:**
- Technology efficiency gap vs silicon
- Tariff policy risk (administration change)
- Execution on US expansion
- Chinese competition relentless
- Commodity pricing pressure
- Tellurium still partially China-sourced
