First Solar — Only major US solar panel manufacturer. Thin-film CdTe technology. Beneficiary of IRA and [[China]] tariffs.

The only US-headquartered solar manufacturer at scale, using proprietary thin-film CdTe technology (not Chinese crystalline silicon) with better hot-climate performance and a vertically integrated supply chain across Ohio, Malaysia, Vietnam, and India. Primary beneficiary of IRA domestic content credits and China tariff/ban risk — 98.7% of corporate solar PPAs come from hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta) who prefer domestic supply. The bull case: irreplaceable US manufacturing position, AI data center power demand driving utility-scale solar, and policy tailwinds from both IRA and trade restrictions. The bear case: lower panel efficiency vs Chinese silicon, capacity constraints, and policy risk if IRA incentives are rolled back.

## Why First Solar matters

First Solar is the only US-headquartered solar manufacturer at scale:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#1 US solar manufacturer |
| Technology | Thin-film CdTe (not silicon) |
| Manufacturing | US, Malaysia, Vietnam, [[India]] |
| Policy tailwind | IRA domestic content, [[China]] tariffs |

---

## Technology differentiation

Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) thin-film:
- Different from Chinese crystalline silicon
- Better hot-climate performance
- Lower temperature coefficient
- Vertically integrated manufacturing

Vs Chinese silicon panels:
| Aspect | First Solar | Chinese silicon |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Technology | Thin-film CdTe | Crystalline Si |
| Efficiency | Lower (but improving) | Higher |
| Hot climate | Better | Degrades more |
| Supply chain | US/allied | [[China]]-dependent |

---

## AI data center opportunity

Why data centers choose First Solar:
- Domestic content for IRA credits
- Avoids [[China]] tariff/ban risk
- Utility-scale focus
- Reliable supply

Hyperscaler demand:
- Amazon, Microsoft, Google, [[Meta]] all buying solar
- 98.7% of corporate PPAs from hyperscalers
- First Solar = preferred domestic supplier

---

## Manufacturing footprint

| Location | Capacity |
|----------|----------|
| Ohio (multiple) | ~6 GW |
| Alabama | Expanding |
| Louisiana | New facility |
| Malaysia | ~3 GW |
| Vietnam | ~3 GW |
| [[India]] | ~3 GW |

US expansion: IRA incentives driving domestic buildout.

---

## Policy tailwinds

[[Inflation]] Reduction Act (IRA):
- Domestic content bonuses
- Manufacturing tax credits
- 10-year visibility

[[China]] tariffs:
- AD/CVD duties on Chinese panels
- [[Southeast Asia]] circumvention crackdown
- First Solar exempt (CdTe, not silicon)

---

## [[Critical minerals]] exposure

First Solar uses tellurium, not rare earths — different risk profile:

| Material | Use | Supply chain |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Tellurium | CdTe thin-film | [[China]] ~60% refining |
| Cadmium | CdTe thin-film | Byproduct of zinc |

Better positioned than silicon solar:
- Rare earth magnets not required (no motors)
- Tellurium not on [[China]]'s 2025 export control list
- But still some [[China]] supply chain exposure

Vs Chinese silicon panels:
- Chinese panels require rare earths (inverters, trackers)
- First Solar's vertically integrated manufacturing reduces touchpoints
- IRA domestic content requirements favor US supply chains

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for the broader context.

## Tesla solar threat (Feb 2026)

[[Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] announced 100 GW/year solar cell production target — would dwarf First Solar's entire US operation. First Solar stock fell ~7% on news.

| Metric | First Solar | Tesla target |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| US capacity (2026) | 14 GW | 100 GW (aspirational) |
| Technology | Thin-film CdTe | Crystalline Si (presumed) |
| Current status | Operating at scale | Evaluating factory sites |

Locations under evaluation: Buffalo NY (expansion to 10 GW), second NY facility, Arizona, Idaho.

Mitigants for First Solar:
- Tesla's 100 GW is aspirational — no proven cell manufacturing at scale
- SolarCity acquisition (2016) failed to realize solar ambitions
- CdTe thin-film is different technology — not direct cell competition
- Tesla teams visited Chinese equipment suppliers — execution risk
- First Solar has decade of manufacturing experience

Risk: If Tesla executes even partially (10-20 GW), US solar manufacturing capacity glut could compress panel prices and erode First Solar's domestic premium.

## Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 25, 2026)

Weak results and disappointing 2026 guidance triggered a **-13.6% single-day drop** on Feb 25 — steepest since June, wiping ~$4B in market cap.

### Q4 results

| Metric | Q4 2025 | vs Estimate |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Revenue | **$1.68B** | Beat ($1.57B est.) |
| EPS | **$4.84** | Miss ($5.14 est., -$0.30) |
| Capex (FY2025) | $870M | Down from $1.5B prior year |

### 2026 guidance

| Metric | FY2026 Guide | Consensus |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Revenue | **$4.9B-$5.2B** | Well below Street |
| Capex | $800M-$1B | — |
| Core gross margin (ex-45X) | ~7% | — |

**Why it matters:** Revenue guidance was the main catalyst for the selloff. Management cited tariff headwinds, underutilization costs, and transition to new capacity. Core gross margin of ~7% (excluding Section 45X manufacturing credits) exposes how dependent First Solar is on IRA subsidies for profitability.

**Analyst reaction:** [[Goldman Sachs]] lowered price target. Multiple downgrades across the Street.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Only US solar manufacturer at scale
- IRA domestic content tailwind
- [[China]] tariff beneficiary
- AI data center demand
- Contracted backlog visibility
- Less rare earth exposed than silicon solar

Bear:
- Technology efficiency gap vs silicon
- Tariff policy risk (administration change)
- Execution on US expansion
- Chinese competition relentless
- Commodity pricing pressure
- Tellurium still partially [[China]]-sourced
