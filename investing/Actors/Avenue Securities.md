# Avenue Securities

HQ: Miami, Florida (US operations); São Paulo (Brazil-facing)
Founded: June 2017
Founder/CEO: [[Roberto Lee]] (ex-[[XP Inc]], ex-Clear Corretora)
Parent: [[Itaú Unibanco]] (50.1% controlling stake as of Dec 2025)

The dominant platform for Brazilians investing in US markets. Avenue bridges the gap between Brazil and US capital markets — offering a Portuguese-language interface, BRL-to-USD currency exchange, and direct access to US stocks, ETFs, options, fixed income, and international funds. Think of it as the [[Robinhood]] of cross-border investing for Brazilians.

## Business model

Avenue operates as a US-registered broker-dealer (Avenue Securities LLC) that specifically targets Brazilian retail investors. Revenue comes from:

1. Brokerage commissions — trades in US stocks, ETFs, options
2. FX spread — BRL/USD currency exchange for funding accounts (this is likely the biggest margin driver)
3. Interest income — margin lending, cash sweep
4. Fund distribution — international investment funds (recently added [[Oaktree]] funds)
5. Banking services — international debit card, checking account

The FX component is key. Every Brazilian investor sending money to the US pays a spread on the exchange. At scale, this is a recurring, high-margin revenue stream tied to both new deposits and rebalancing flows.

## History and ownership

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2017 | Roberto Lee founds Avenue in Miami after leaving [[XP Inc]] ecosystem |
| 2018 | Partners with DriveWealth for fractional US stock trading infrastructure |
| 2018-2021 | Rapid growth as Brazilians discover US investing (interest rate differential, Real depreciation) |
| Jul 2022 | [[Itaú Unibanco]] acquires 35% stake for R$493M (~$92M), valuing Avenue at ~$260M |
| 2022-2025 | Continued growth; 229K active clients → much larger (estimated 500K+ by 2025) |
| Mar 2025 | AUM reaches ~$5.5B; 15.5% allocated to international investment funds |
| Dec 2025 | [[Itaú Unibanco]] exercises option to take 50.1% controlling stake via CADE filing |

The Itaú acquisition is transformative. [[Itaú Unibanco]] is Brazil's largest private bank — integrating Avenue gives Itaú's ~60M clients direct access to US investments, and gives Avenue distribution at a scale no startup could achieve alone.

## Competitive landscape

| Platform | Target market | Differentiator |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Avenue | Brazilians investing in US | Portuguese-language, BRL/USD FX, Itaú integration |
| [[Interactive Brokers]] | Global, all investor types | Deepest product set, multi-currency, institutional-grade |
| [[XP Inc]] international | XP clients wanting US exposure | Integrated with XP's Brazilian ecosystem |
| [[Banco Inter]] (via US subsidiary) | Inter clients | Banking + investing bundle |
| [[BTG Pactual]] international | HNW Brazilians | Full-service private banking |
| [[Passfolio]] | Brazilians (smaller) | Similar concept, less scale |
| [[Nomad]] | Brazilians abroad | Banking + remittance focus |

Avenue's moat: first-mover advantage + Itaú distribution. When Itaú fully integrates Avenue into its app for 60M clients, the growth flywheel accelerates dramatically. The question is whether Itaú integration dilutes Avenue's brand identity.

## Leadership

### [[Roberto Lee]]
- Founder and CEO
- Previously at [[XP Inc]] ecosystem: co-founded WinTrade Home Broker (2005), co-founded Clear Corretora (CEO until 2017)
- Based in Miami
- Serial entrepreneur in Brazilian brokerage space — built Avenue after seeing the gap in cross-border access

## Why Avenue matters for the SMA opportunity

Avenue is the most likely custodian for a CVM-registered consultant serving Brazilian clients investing in US markets:

- Brazilian clients already trust and use Avenue
- Portuguese-language interface removes friction
- BRL/USD exchange built in
- FINRA-regulated, SIPC-insured — provides credibility
- No minimum account size for clients
- A CVM consultant could build model portfolios that clients execute through their Avenue accounts

The alternative custodians ([[Interactive Brokers]], [[Charles Schwab]]) are more powerful but less accessible to average Brazilian retail investors who may not speak English fluently.

---

## Risks

- [[Itaú Unibanco]] integration could subsume Avenue's independent identity
- FX spread compression as competition increases
- Regulatory risk — Brazilian rules on cross-border investing could tighten
- Competition from [[XP Inc]], [[BTG Pactual]], [[Banco Inter]] all launching international products
- USD/BRL volatility affects client appetite for US investing
