| Funding struggles | Difficulty raising at prior valuation |
| Competition | Midjourney, DALL-E, Adobe Firefly |
| Monetization | Open-source = hard to capture value |

|--------|--------------|------------|
| Model | Open-source | Closed |

| Revenue | APIs, enterprise | $200M+ ARR |
| Moat | Community, brand | Quality, UX |

Open-source built adoption but not revenue.
