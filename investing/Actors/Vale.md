Vale — World's largest [[Iron ore|iron ore]] producer (328 Mt in FY2024, targeting 360 Mt by 2030). Highest-grade ore globally — Carajas at 67% Fe commands a premium to benchmark. Growing [[Copper]] (348 kt, targeting 900 kt/year) and nickel (~160 kt). Brumadinho (2019) and Mariana (2015) dam disasters remain financial and reputational overhangs — Mariana settlement of $31.7B is the world's largest environmental settlement. NYSE: VALE, B3: VALE3.

## Why Vale matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | VALE (NYSE) / VALE3 ([[B3]]) |
| Market cap | ~US$71B |
| FY2024 revenue | ~US$38.1B |
| FY2024 proforma EBITDA | ~US$15.4B |
| FY2024 iron ore | 327.7 Mt (highest since 2018) |
| FY2024 copper | 348.2 kt (record at Salobo) |
| Dividend yield | ~5-8% (including specials) |
| HQ | Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]] |

Vale produces the world's highest-grade iron ore (Carajas 67% Fe), which commands a structural premium over the 62% Fe benchmark — the inverse of [[Fortescue]]'s grade discount.

## Price vs mining peers (since 2020)

![[vale-vs-bhp-rio-fsugy-price-chart.png]]
*Vale significantly underperformed [[BHP]], [[Rio Tinto]], and [[Fortescue]] from 2021-2024, weighed down by Brumadinho/Mariana liabilities and [[China]] property weakness. The 2025 rally (+82% 52-week) reflects settlement resolution and copper growth narrative.*

## Iron ore operations

### Production by system

| System | FY2024 | Key driver |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Northern (Carajas) | ~178 Mt | S11D record 83.0 Mt. 67% Fe |
| Southeastern | +0.5 Mt YoY | Brucutu 4th processing line. Capanema commissioning (Nov 2024, +15 Mtpa target) |
| Southern | -7.7 Mt YoY | Deliberate shift to higher-margin products |
| Total | 327.7 Mt | Highest since 2018, exceeded 310-320 Mt guidance |

### Path to 360 Mt

| Year | Guidance / actual |
|------|-------------------|
| FY2024 | 327.7 Mt (actual, exceeded guidance) |
| FY2025 | 336 Mt (actual, exceeded 325-335 Mt guidance) |
| FY2026 | 335-345 Mt |
| 2030 | ~360 Mt |

Novo Carajas Program (Feb 2025): R$70B ($12.3B) investment through 2030 in Para state. Carajas iron ore to reach 200 Mtpa by 2030 via S11D expansion (+20 Mt) and new projects. Pellets + briquettes targeted at 60-70 Mt by 2030.

### Costs

C1 cash cost: US$21.3/t in FY2025 (-2% YoY, second consecutive year of reduction). Q4 2024 hit $18.8/t (lowest since Q1 2022). Copper all-in costs fell to negative $900/t in FY2025 — lowest in Vale's history. Nickel all-in costs fell 35% YoY to $9,000/t.

Pellets: 36.9 Mt in FY2024 (+1.2% YoY).

---

## [[Copper]] growth

FY2024 copper production: 348.2 kt (+6.6% YoY, record at Salobo). FY2025: 382.3 kt (surpassed 340-370 kt guidance).

| Operation | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Salobo ([[Brazil]]) | Record production. Salobo III ramp complete. Throughput at 32 Mtpa, targeting 36 Mtpa. Wheaton Precious Metals paid $370M for Salobo III Phase 1 stream |
| Sossego ([[Brazil]]) | Down ~3.3 kt YoY (lower feed grade). Temporarily suspended Feb-Jun 2024 by state judge |
| Sudbury ([[Canada]]) | Record full year (63.8 kt). [[Glencore]] JV framework to combine underground operations |
| Cristalino ([[Brazil]]) | Feasibility stage, conceptual 120 ktpa. 40 km from Sossego |

Targets: ~500 kt by 2028. 900 kt/year over the next decade. Top-5 globally by 2035. Copper EBITDA is not separately disclosed — at 382 kt, Vale is well behind [[BHP]] (>2 Mtpa, ~45% of EBITDA) and [[Rio Tinto]] (697 kt, ~15% of EBITDA). The VBM IPO would make copper/nickel profit contribution visible for the first time.

---

## Nickel

FY2024 production: ~160 kt. FY2025: 177.2 kt (highest since 2022).

| Operation | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| PTVI (Indonesia, Sorowako) | ~70.8 kt Ni-in-matte. Deconsolidated Q3 2024 after divestment to MIND ID (~34% stake) |
| Sudbury ([[Canada]]) | +20% mill throughput YoY |
| Voisey's Bay ([[Canada]]) | Underground mine extension (VBME) construction completed Dec 2024. ~45 kt Ni capacity. Full ramp 2H26 |
| Thompson ([[Canada]]) | Strategic review launched Jan 2025. $1.4B impairment |
| Onca Puma ([[Brazil]]) | Second furnace at full capacity Nov 2025. Record Q4 2025 |

Q4 2024: $3.5B total nickel impairments ($1.4B Thompson + $540M Voisey's Bay + others) on lower long-term price assumptions amid Indonesian oversupply.

## Brumadinho and Mariana settlements

### Brumadinho (Jan 2019, 270+ killed)

R$38B comprehensive settlement. As of May 2025: 99% of payment obligations complete, 41% of performance obligations complete. Remaining cash outflows: $1.0B (2025), $0.8B (2026), $0.5B (2027), declining through 2035. Dam decharacterization 57% complete.

### Mariana / Fundao (Nov 2015 — Samarco JV with [[BHP]])

$31.7B (R$170B) definitive settlement signed Oct 2024 — the largest environmental settlement globally. Samarco to make annual payments over 20 years. As of Dec 2025: R$73B disbursed, ~304K compensation agreements. 31 of 49 eligible municipalities rejected terms. UK litigation ongoing — liability decision expected late 2025/early 2026.

Total estimated 2025 dam-related cash outflows: ~$4.2B. Declining to ~$2.6B in 2026.

---

## Vale Base Metals — planned IPO

IPO targeted late 2026 or early 2027. Estimated valuation: ~$40B. Shaun Usmar appointed VBM CEO (Oct 2024). Brazilian copper assets transferred to Salobo Metais S.A.; nickel to a new entity. Both remain wholly owned by Vale for now.

[[Glencore]] JV in Sudbury: framework to combine underground operations. Equal partners. FID targeted 1H 2027. Estimated cost: $1.6-2.0B.

Long-term target: double VBM capacity to ~700 kt/year by 2035 (copper to 900 kt, nickel to 300 kt).

FY2025 Q4 EBITDA of $4.8B (+17% YoY); VBM EBITDA doubled to $1.4B. EPS missed estimates on continued impairments, but market focused on operational trajectory — iron ore, copper, and nickel all exceeded guidance highs.

## 2025-2026 rally (+47% in 2025, +82% 52-week)

Vale's multi-year underperformance reversed despite weak [[Iron ore|iron ore]] prices (~$101/t, less than half the 2021 peak). Part of a broader mining supercycle: MSCI Metals & Mining Index surged ~90% since start of 2025, driven by [[Copper]] breakout (~$6/lb, tripled from 2020), AI/data center demand, and energy transition.

**Phase 1 — dam overhang removal (Oct 2024-mid 2025):** Mariana $31.7B settlement signed October 2024. Brumadinho 99% paid. Stock initially reacted modestly (+1.2%) but sustained re-rating followed as the market priced in declining cash outflows ($4.2B in 2025 → $2.6B in 2026).

**Phase 2 — operational execution (Q3-Q4 2025):** Record Q3 production (94.4 Mt iron ore). Full-year 2025: 336 Mt iron ore (exceeded 325-335 guidance), 382 kt copper (exceeded 340-370 guidance), 177 kt nickel (exceeded 160-175 guidance) — all three commodities beat the high end. C1 iron ore cost fell to $21.3/t (second consecutive year of reduction). Copper all-in costs hit negative $900/t — lowest in Vale's history. Vale Day investor event reinforced copper growth narrative (500 kt by 2028, 900 kt target).

**Phase 3 — analyst upgrades + Q4 earnings (Jan-Feb 2026):** [[Bank of America|BofA]] named Vale top pick for 2026 (target $17). [[Goldman Sachs]] raised to $18. Indonesia's 34% nickel production cut flagged as catalyst for nickel recovery. Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 12): EBITDA $4.8B (+17% YoY), VBM EBITDA doubled to $1.4B, but EPS missed on impairments. Stock held up — market focused on operational trajectory. $2.8B dividends for 2026 (including $1B extraordinary).

Bear case: ING forecasts iron ore averaging $95/t for 2026, dam-related cash outflows still meaningful, Simandou (40-50 Mt by 2027) adds high-grade supply. [[Bank of America|BofA]] downgraded European mining sector to underweight.

## Investment case

Bull:
- #1 iron ore globally with highest grade (Carajas 67% Fe = structural premium)
- Path to 360 Mt by 2030, with R$70B Novo Carajas investment
- Copper growing fast: 348 kt → 382 kt → 500 kt → 900 kt target
- VBM IPO (~$40B valuation) could unlock significant value
- Brumadinho settlement 99% paid; Mariana settlement signed — overhang clearing
- Dividend yield 5-8% including specials
- [[Brazil]]ian real depreciation boosts dollar margins
- 52-week rally (+82%) reflects re-rating catalyst

Bear:
- [[China]] steel demand (~70% of seaborne iron ore) in structural decline from property sector
- Mariana: 31 of 49 municipalities rejected terms; UK litigation ongoing
- ~$4.2B dam-related cash outflows in 2025 still meaningful
- $3.5B nickel impairments signal oversupply challenge (Indonesian competition)
- Thompson strategic review — potential nickel exit
- [[Brazil]]ian political risk (golden shares, regulatory)
- FY2024 recurring FCF collapsed to ~$0.8B (dam payouts + lower EBITDA)
- Iron ore price volatility remains dominant earnings driver
