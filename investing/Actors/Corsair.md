**Corsair** — Gaming peripherals and memory modules. Suspended orders — can't get chips.

## Why Corsair matters for this vault

Corsair shows how smaller vendors are crushed by memory shortage:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Business | Memory modules, peripherals, gaming |
| Crisis response | Suspended new orders |
| Problem | Can't obtain sufficient chips |
| Exposure | Direct memory module sales |

## Memory module crisis

**Late 2025 situation:**
- Suspended new orders
- Unable to obtain sufficient memory chips
- Spot pricing punitive
- No volume commitments like Dell/Lenovo

**Smaller vendors hit hardest:**
- No long-term supply agreements
- At mercy of spot market
- Memory makers prioritize large OEMs
- Corsair = squeezed out

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Memory exposure |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Memory (Vengeance, Dominator)** | Direct — sells modules |
| **Components (PSUs, cases)** | None |
| **Peripherals (keyboards, mice)** | None |
| **Streaming (Elgato)** | Low |

Memory modules = directly exposed to shortage.

---

## Comparison: Large vs small vendors

| Vendor type | Situation |
|-------------|-----------|
| [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]] | Lock orders early, less spot exposure |
| **Corsair, ADATA, G.Skill** | Spot pricing, suspended orders |
| Transcend | Halted shipments entirely |

Scale = survival advantage in memory shortage.

---

## Gaming ecosystem

**Broader business:**
- Corsair is gaming-focused
- RGB memory, high-performance modules
- Enthusiast market
- Premium pricing normally possible

**But:** Can't charge premium if you can't get supply.

## Other affected module vendors

| Vendor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Corsair** | Suspended orders |
| ADATA | Can't get chips |
| Transcend | Halted shipments Nov 2025 |
| G.Skill | Supply constrained |
| Crucial ([[Micron]]) | Prioritizing own brand? |

Entire DIMM/SO-DIMM aftermarket disrupted.

---

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- Memory module business broken
- No supply = no revenue
- Spot pricing destroys margins
- Structural disadvantage vs OEMs

**Bull:**
- Peripherals/streaming unaffected
- Gaming ecosystem sticky
- If memory normalizes
- Depressed valuation
