## Why Fujifilm matters

A successful corporate transformation story — from dying film business to healthcare and semiconductor materials:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 4901.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~¥4.5T (~$30B) |
| Photoresist share | ~10% global |
| EUV resist growth | Contracts worth $250M+ (mid-2025) |
| Business mix | [[Healthcare]] > Electronics > Imaging |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | % Revenue | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **[[Healthcare]]** | ~45% | Medical systems, biopharma CDMO |
| **Advanced Materials** | ~25% | Electronic materials, displays |
| **Imaging** | ~15% | Instax, legacy film |
| **Business Innovation** | ~15% | Document solutions |

Electronics materials (including photoresists) sit within Advanced Materials.

## Photoresist business

| Product | Position | Recent developments |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **EUV photoresists** | Top 5 | 30% capacity expansion (Kumamoto, June 2025) |
| **ArF** | Established | Stable demand |
| **Fluorine-free developers** | Innovation | EUV-compatible, launched recently |

**Kumamoto expansion:** 30% capacity increase for EUV resists, driven by [[TSMC]] demand at their [[Japan]] fab.

## Competitive position

| Company | Share | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | Pure-play |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Diversified |
| **Fujifilm** | ~10% | Diversified |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | Growing |

**[[Japan]] dominance:** Top 4 Japanese players = 75%+ of EUV photoresist market.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Healthcare]] provides stable base (biopharma CDMO growing)
- Semiconductor materials offer growth optionality
- Proven ability to transform business model
- Strong balance sheet for continued investment
- TSMC relationship (Kumamoto fab proximity)

**Bear:**
- [[Photoresists]] are small part of overall business
- Conglomerate discount
- [[Healthcare]] segment competitive pressures
- Behind pure-plays (JSR, TOK) in scale
- Imaging segment still declining

---

## Why not pure-play

Electronics materials are ~25% of Fujifilm revenue, and photoresists are a subset of that. Investors primarily get healthcare exposure with semiconductor materials as a smaller growth driver.

**Better for:** Investors wanting diversified [[Japan]] exposure with semiconductor optionality, not pure photoresist plays.

**For pure photoresist:** [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] is cleaner.

## Corporate transformation

Fujifilm's pivot from film is a business school case study:
- **2000s:** Film market collapsing (digital photography)
- **Response:** Leveraged chemical expertise into healthcare and electronics
- **Result:** [[Healthcare]] now largest segment, electronics materials growing
