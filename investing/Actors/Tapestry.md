# Tapestry

**American accessible luxury group** — owns Coach (~80% of revenue) and Kate Spade. Sold Stuart Weitzman (Aug 2025). A turnaround success: Coach sales +10% in FY25, stock nearly doubled, >$5 adjusted EPS. Failed $8.5B bid for [[Capri Holdings]] blocked by FTC (2024). Now focused on Coach growth + Kate Spade recovery.

## Brand portfolio

| Brand | % Revenue | FY25 Performance | Status |
|-------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Coach** | ~80% | **+10% sales** | Star performer |
| **Kate Spade** | ~18% | -10% sales | Struggling |
| Stuart Weitzman | Sold | — | Divested Aug 2025 |

## Coach — the engine

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue growth (FY25) | +10% |
| Customer acquisition | New customers growing |
| International | Strength in China, Japan |
| Positioning | Accessible luxury, heritage leather |

**What's working:**
- Creative director Stuart Vevers driving brand heat
- Tabby bag as hero product
- Gen Z customer acquisition (TikTok/social)
- Price increases sticking
- China growth outpacing peers

## Kate Spade — the problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue decline (FY25) | -10% |
| Impairment (Aug 2025) | **$855M** writedown |
| Issue | Lost brand identity |
| Original acquisition | $2.4B (2017) |

Kate Spade has lost its positioning — not distinctive enough vs. Coach, not cheap enough vs. mass market. Tapestry won't do acquisitions until Kate Spade returns to sustainable growth.

## Failed Capri merger

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | Aug 2023 |
| Price | $8.5B for [[Capri Holdings]] |
| Blocked | FTC, Oct 2024 |
| Terminated | Nov 2024 |
| Rationale blocked | Handbag market competition (Coach vs Michael Kors) |

**Post-merger pivot:** $3B+ returned to shareholders cumulatively. Focus now on organic growth rather than M&A. No near-term acquisitions planned.

## Financial performance

| Metric | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | ~$6.7B | ~$6.7B | ~$6.7B |
| Coach growth | — | — | +10% |
| Kate Spade | — | — | -10% |

**FY26 guidance:** Mid-single-digit revenue growth (ex-Stuart Weitzman), 14% dividend increase.

## vs. Capri Holdings

| Factor | Tapestry | [[Capri Holdings]] |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Core brand | Coach (+10%) | Michael Kors (-15%) |
| Margin | Healthy | Negative |
| Stock (2024-25) | Nearly doubled | Collapsed |
| Strategy | Working | Failing |
| M&A | Disciplined (walked away) | Desperate (sold Versace at loss) |

**The divergence:** Same "accessible luxury" space, opposite trajectories. Coach's heritage + creative direction succeeded where Michael Kors' repositioning failed.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Coach momentum (+10%, new customers, Gen Z)
- >$5 EPS, ~15x earnings = reasonable valuation
- $3B+ shareholder returns
- No M&A distraction, clean story
- International growth (China, Japan)

**Bear:**
- Kate Spade still declining ($855M writedown)
- Accessible luxury = vulnerable segment
- Tariff headwinds on imports
- Coach growth may normalize
- CEO transition risk (Crevoiserat tenure)
