## Financial performance

| Year | Revenue (€M) | Net Income (€M) | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| FY16 | 388 | -4 | CL Final appearance |
| FY17 | 563 | +43 | CL Final, Ronaldo hype |
| FY18 | 495 | -40 | Ronaldo signing (€100M) |
| FY19 | 621 | -90 | Peak revenue, wage spike |
| FY20 | 574 | -71 | COVID begins |
| FY21 | 401 | **-210** | COVID full impact |
| FY22 | 443 | **-254** | Scandal year |
| FY23 | 507 | -123 | Points deduction |
| FY24 | 395 | -95 | European ban impact |

**Structurally loss-making.** Net losses every year since FY18. Wage bill consistently 70-80%+ of revenue — unsustainable. Ronaldo signing (2018) inflated wages; COVID and European ban crushed revenue.

## Football performance

## Investment case

- One of Europe's most valuable football brands

- Exor support ensures solvency
- Potential Serie A recovery / new TV deal

**Bear:**
- Structurally loss-making
- Football club economics broken (wage spiral)
- Legal/regulatory overhang
