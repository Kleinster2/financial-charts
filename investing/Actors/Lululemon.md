# Lululemon

**Premium athletic lifestyle brand** — first to cross $10B revenue (FY24: $10.6B, +10%). Athleisure pioneer with yoga/running heritage. International expansion is the growth story (China +22%, 130+ stores, $1B revenue). But US growth stalling (+2% Q1 2025), stock lost ~50% in 2025, CEO Calvin McDonald departing Jan 2026. Valuation compressed from 40x to ~14x forward earnings.

## Financial performance

| Metric | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue ($B) | 8.1 | 9.6 | 10.6 |
| Revenue growth | +30% | +19% | +10% |

## FY25 guidance & challenges

| Metric | FY25 Guidance |
|--------|---------------|
| Revenue | $11.15-11.30B (+5-7%) |
| EPS | $14.95-15.15 (+2-3%) |
| US growth | Low-single-digit |
| International | +20%+ |
| Tariff impact | -$240M profit headwind |

### Q3 FY25:
- EPS $2.59 (down from $2.87 prior year)
- Gross margin decreased 290bps to 55.6%
- US comps: -1%

## The two-speed story

### US (70%+ of revenue) — stalling
| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Comp sales | -1% (Q1 FY25) |
| Competition | Alo Yoga, Vuori, Nike women's |
| Market saturation | Core customer penetrated |
| Innovation gaps | Fewer "must-have" new products |

### International (20% of revenue) — booming
| Market | Growth | Stores |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **China** | +22% (Q1 FY25) | 130+ (from 10 in 2018) |
| [[Europe]] | Double-digit | Expanding |
| APAC | Strong | New markets |
| New entries | Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Turkey, Czech [[Republic]], [[India]] (2026) |

**The bull thesis:** Only 20% international today. If Lululemon reaches Nike/Adidas-level international mix (50%+), revenue doubles from here.

---

## Margin profile

| Metric | Value | Comparison |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Gross margin | 59.2% | Higher than Nike (~44%), Adidas (~52%) |
| Operating margin | 24.3% | Among best in apparel |
| DTC mix | ~90% | Controls distribution |

**Why margins are high:** Premium pricing ($100+ leggings), minimal wholesale, no discounting culture, strong brand loyalty.

---

## CEO transition

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Calvin McDonald | CEO since 2018, departing Jan 2026 |
| Tenure impact | Grew revenue from $3.3B to $10.6B |
| Successor | Search underway |
| Risk | Transition during growth slowdown |

---

## Stock valuation

| Metric | Current | Historical |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Forward P/E | ~14x | Was 40x+ |
| Stock decline (2025) | **-50%** | S&P +10% |
| From ATH (~$516) | Down ~60% | — |

**De-rating:** Market no longer paying growth premium as US saturates and growth decelerates to mid-single-digit.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- International runway massive (only 20% today)
- China $1B and growing +20%+
- 59% gross margins, 24% operating margins
- 14x earnings = historically cheap
- Brand loyalty extremely high
- [[India]] entry 2026 = next China-like opportunity

**Bear:**
- US stalling (-1% comps), 70% of revenue
- Growth deceleration (10% → 5-7% → ?)
- CEO departure adds uncertainty
- $240M tariff headwind
- Competition intensifying (Alo, Vuori)
- Athleisure as category may be maturing
