## Key partnerships

SAP: Minority investor (2022). Icertis co-sold as "SAP Ariba Contract Intelligence by Icertis" through SAP's sales channel. Direct access to SAP's massive enterprise install base.

[[Microsoft]]: Both customer (220,000 employees on the platform) and technology partner. Built on Azure. Real-time co-editing in Word Online. Icertis Copilots powered by Azure OpenAI.

---

## AI strategy — agentic contracting

Icertis is pushing agentic workflows for contract management — AI agents that handle drafting, review, risk scoring, obligation tracking, and compliance monitoring with human-in-the-loop oversight.

90% of procurement leaders surveyed have considered or are using AI agents for operations. 42% of organizations already implementing AI in contract management.

Positioning: enterprise-grade agentic platform that draws from productivity tools and enterprise systems. "Autonomous contracting" as the end state, but emphasizing human judgment for high-risk decisions.

---

## AI disruption exposure

CLM sits squarely in the [[AI disintermediation]] crosshairs. Contract review, extraction, risk flagging, and compliance monitoring are exactly the tasks LLMs do well. Multiple startups (Avokaado, Leah/ContractPodAi, Juro) are building AI-native CLM from scratch rather than bolting AI onto legacy workflows.

Icertis's moat: deep enterprise integrations (SAP, Microsoft ecosystem), $1T+ contract corpus for training, regulatory complexity that favors incumbents, and switching costs (multi-year contracts, custom implementations).

Risk: over-customization creates tech debt — some customers revert to manual processes. AI-native competitors can offer 80% of functionality at a fraction of the cost.

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Positioning |
|------------|-------------|
| [[Agiloft]] | No-code customization, complex logic |
| [[Ironclad]] | Modern UX, self-service workflows, US-focused |
| [[DocuSign]] CLM | E-signature ecosystem, global scale |
| ContractPodAi (Leah) | AI-native, multi-department agents |
| Avokaado | AI-first, contracts as autonomous agents |
| Conga | Salesforce-native CLM |

Icertis is the enterprise heavyweight — Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader. But the AI-native challengers are moving fast.

## Recent activity

Nov 2025: Acquired Dioptra (most recent M&A).

### Exploring $5B sale (Feb 11, 2026)

Working with [[Goldman Sachs]] on a potential sale at up to $5B. Buyout firms have shown preliminary interest. [[SoftBank]] first invested at $5B in 2021 — flat valuation after 4 years.

Co-founder Samir Bodas passed away in late January at 61, which may have accelerated succession planning. No final decision — could decide against a sale.

No IPO filing as of Feb 2026. Secondary market prices vary widely ($18-80/share depending on platform), suggesting significant uncertainty about future valuation.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Mission-critical enterprise software with high switching costs
- SAP/Microsoft partnerships create distribution moat
- $300M+ ARR growing, positive FCF
- Agentic AI positioning could expand TAM
- 30%+ Fortune 100 penetration

Bear:
- $5B valuation on $300M ARR (16x+ revenue) is rich for CLM
- AI-native competitors can undercut on price and implementation speed
- Over-customization problem creates churn risk
- CLM is a prime [[AI disintermediation]] target — LLMs can handle contract review/extraction natively
- No clear IPO timeline; secondary market illiquid
