## Editorial stance

- **Unsigned articles** — institutional voice, not bylined opinion
- **Classical liberal** — free markets, free trade, globalization, immigration
- **Internationalist** — pro-[[EU]], pro-NATO, skeptical of populism
- **Data-driven** — heavy use of charts and statistics

Often accused of both left-wing and right-wing bias depending on the issue.
