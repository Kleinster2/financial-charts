Palo Alto Networks — Enterprise cybersecurity leader. Platform consolidation strategy.

---

## Why Palo Alto matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~$130B |
| Ticker | PANW |
| Revenue | ~$10B/year |
| CEO | Nikesh Arora |

---

## Products

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Network Security | Next-gen firewall (origin), Prisma SD-WAN |
| Cloud Security | Prisma Cloud, Cortex Cloud |
| Security Operations | Cortex XDR, XSIAM |
| AI Security | Precision AI, AI Access Security |

"Platformization" = consolidate security tools.

---

## Competitive position

| Company | Focus | Market cap |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | Enterprise platform | ~$120B |
| [[CrowdStrike]] | Endpoint, cloud-native | ~$90B |
| [[Fortinet]] | Mid-market, firewall | ~$75B |
| [[Zscaler]] | Zero trust, cloud | ~$30B |

Largest pure-play cybersecurity company.

---

## Platformization strategy

Goal: Become the "one vendor" for enterprise security.

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Acquisitions | 15+ deals (Demisto, Expanse, etc.) |
| Bundling | Multi-product discounts |
| AI integration | Cortex XSIAM automation |
| Free trials | "Land and expand" |

Controversial: Q4 2024 free trial announcement hit stock.

## China cybersecurity ban (Jan 2026)

Banned by Beijing — China instructed companies to stop using Palo Alto Networks products and replace with domestic alternatives by H1 2026.

Rationale: Beijing fears Western cybersecurity software could collect and transmit confidential information abroad.

Other banned US firms: VMware, Fortinet, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, [[SentinelOne]], McAfee, Recorded Future, Claroty, Rapid7, Wiz

See [[China cybersecurity ban]] for full context.

## Q2 FY2026 earnings (Feb 17, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $2.59B (+15% YoY) |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $1.03 (+27% YoY) |
| Net income | $432M |
| NGS ARR | $6.3B (+33% YoY) |
| Operating margin | 30.3% (non-GAAP) |
| Stock reaction | -6% (Q3 guidance miss) |

Beat Q2 estimates but Q3 EPS guidance of $0.78-0.80 missed consensus of $0.92 — investor concern over [[CyberArk]] integration costs. FY26 revenue guidance raised to $11.28-11.31B but full-year EPS guidance cut to $3.65-3.70 (from prior range) as integration costs from CyberArk, [[Chronosphere]], and [[Koi]] weigh on margins. Stock fell 6.8% on Feb 18 (down as much as 10% intraday). Scotiabank cut PT from $228 to $180.

### Platformization KPIs (Q2 FY26)

| Metric | Value | Growth |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Platformized customers | ~1,550 | +35% YoY |
| Platformized NRR | 119% | — |
| Platformized churn | Low single-digit | — |
| XSIAM customers | 600+ | +200% YoY |
| SASE ARR | >$1.5B | +40% YoY |
| Secure browser customers | 1,500+ | — |
| Prisma AIRS customers | 3x QoQ | — |

XSIAM and SASE momentum strongest proof points for platform consolidation thesis. Prisma AIRS (AI security platform) tripling customer base QoQ signals enterprise AI security becoming top priority.

## Restructuring (Feb 2026)

Announced ~500 job cuts alongside Q2 earnings. Separately, ~700 [[CyberArk]] employees notified of dismissal (incl. ~100 in [[Israel]]), with termination dates ranging 3-12 months out. Retention bonuses offered to stay through transition; severance of 4-5 months salary.

## CyberArk acquisition ($25B, closed Feb 11 2026)

Largest transaction in cybersecurity history. [[CyberArk]] shareholders received $45.00 cash + 2.2005 PANW shares per CYBR share. Shareholders approved Nov 13, 2025.

Strategic rationale: machine identities now outnumber human identities 80:1. 75% of organizations have overly permissive privilege models. ~90% have suffered identity-centric breach. CyberArk's PAM, identity provider, and governance tools integrate into Prisma and Cortex platforms.

Regulatory: behavioral remedies required — CyberArk tools must remain interoperable with third-party security vendors (no walled garden).

Planning TASE secondary listing under ticker "CYBR" as tribute to CyberArk's Israeli heritage.

---

## Chronosphere acquisition ($3B+, closed Jan 2026)

Acquired [[Chronosphere]], a cloud-native observability platform, for over $3B. Extends monitoring and observability capabilities across the security platform — part of the broader strategy to own the full security operations stack.

---

## Koi acquisition ($400M, Feb 2026)

Acquiring Israeli startup Koi for ~$400M to secure "agentic endpoints" — AI agents and tools that operate with deep data access but bypass traditional security controls.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | ~$400M (reported) |
| Founded | 2024 |
| Founders | [[Unit 8200]] alumni (Amit Assaraf CEO) |
| Problem | AI agents create unmanaged attack surface on endpoints |
| Integration | Extends Prisma AIRS + Cortex XDR |

The thesis: as enterprises deploy AI agents ([[Agentic AI]]), traditional file-based security misses agent-level threats — credential hijacking, API-based RCE, spoofed agent identities. Koi replaces download buttons with approval workflows and evaluates file/developer risk.

This is Palo Alto's latest in a string of acquisitions building out its AI security platform, following the [[Cybersecurity consolidation]] pattern.
