## Consolidation thesis

Arora's strategy: acquire best-of-breed point solutions, integrate into unified platform.

**The logic:**
- Enterprises have 50+ security vendors — fatigue and gaps
- Integrated platform reduces complexity
- AI requires consolidated data across security stack
- Winners take the whole budget, losers get displaced

## M&A spree (2024-2026)

| Date | Target | Amount | Category |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 2025 | [[CyberArk]] | $25B | Identity security |
| 2025 | Chronosphere | $3.35B | Observability |
| 2025 | Protect AI | $500M | AI security |
| Jan 2026 | Koi (reported) | ~$400M | Endpoint/supply chain |

**Koi acquisition (Jan 2026):**
- Israeli startup, founded 2024
- 8200 Intelligence Corps alumni
- Raised $48M ($38M Series A)
- Investors: Team8, NFX, Battery Ventures, Picture Capital
- Product: Supply Chain Gateway — software supply chain security
- 500K+ endpoints protected, Fortune 50 customers
- Founded after exposing VSCode Marketplace vulnerability

**Strategic fit:** Koi fills endpoint supply chain gap. Arora visited Israel Dec 2025, evaluating startups post-CyberArk close.

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Position |
|------------|----------|
| [[CrowdStrike]] | Endpoint leader, competing on XDR |
| [[Microsoft]] | Security bundled with enterprise |
| [[Zscaler]] | Zero trust / SASE |
| [[Fortinet]] | Network security, more hardware |
| [[SentinelOne]] | Endpoint, smaller |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Consolidation working — taking share from point solutions
- AI creates new attack surface = new TAM
- Platform approach = higher retention, cross-sell
- Arora executing well

**Bear:**
- Valuation assumes continued M&A success
- Integration risk from rapid acquisitions
- Microsoft bundling threat
- Macro sensitivity (security budgets cut last in downturn, but not immune)
