## Product

**Oura Ring 4** (current generation):
- $349 hardware + $5.99/mo subscription
- Sleep, readiness, activity tracking
- HRV, SpO2, temperature
- AI meal tracking (Oct 2025 update)
- Blood test integrations (US)

**Subscription stickiness:** Ring is less useful without subscription — creates lock-in.

## Competitive moat

**IP enforcement:**
- Oct 2025: ITC ruled Ultrahuman infringed Oura patents
- Ultrahuman Ring Air **banned from US sales**
- Signal: Oura will litigate to protect market position

**Why hard to dislodge:**
- Best-in-class app and insights
- Largest health dataset for ring form factor
- Subscription revenue funds R&D
- IP portfolio as defensive moat

## Competition

| Competitor | Threat level | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Samsung Galaxy Ring | High | No subscription, but needs Samsung phone |
| Apple (potential) | High | No ring yet, but Watch competes |
| Chinese (RingConn, Amazfit) | Medium | Price competition, weaker apps |
| Ultrahuman | Low (for now) | Banned in US |
