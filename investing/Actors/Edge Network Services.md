## Operating model

**Fund and partner:**
- Edge fully funds construction
- Local telcos operate landing stations and in-country infrastructure
- Meta retains ownership, partners handle operations

**Examples:**
- **Malbec**: Edge co-owns, [[GlobeNet]] operates
- **Daraja**: Edge funds $23M, [[Safaricom]] operates Kenya landing
- **2Africa**: Consortium model, shared ownership

## Regulatory

Edge Cable Holdings USA files FCC applications for US cable landing licenses. Notable filings:
- Anjana (trans-Atlantic to Spain)
- ORCA (trans-Pacific to Taiwan)
- Various domestic US landings

**2020 Oregon incident**: Edge Cable Holdings cable burial near Tierra Del Mar prompted Oregon to pass stricter decommissioning regulations (2021).

## Strategic rationale

**Why Meta builds cables:**
1. **Capacity**: Internal traffic (FB, Instagram, WhatsApp) requires massive bandwidth
2. **Cost**: Owning vs leasing at scale
3. **Control**: Route selection avoids geopolitical hotspots (Red Sea, South China Sea)
4. **Latency**: Direct routes to key markets

Waterworth notably skips Europe and China — direct US connections to Southern Hemisphere.
