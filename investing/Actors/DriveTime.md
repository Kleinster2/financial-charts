## Gotham allegations (Jan 2026)

[[Gotham City Research]] alleges DriveTime props up Carvana earnings:

| Metric | Gotham claim |
|--------|--------------|
| Leverage | 20x-40x (vs 10.3x historical cap) |
| Cash burn | $1B+ negative FCF 2023-24 |
| EBITDA/interest | 0.5x-1.0x (barely covers debt service) |
| Loan markdowns | $900M while CVNA booked $755M gain on sales |

**Alleged scheme:**
1. Carvana sells loans to DriveTime at inflated prices
2. Books gains on sale
3. Bridgecrest services at suspiciously low 0.117% fee
4. DriveTime absorbs losses, funds via debt issuance
