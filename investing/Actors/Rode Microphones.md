## Manufacturing strategy

Unusually for consumer electronics, RØDE manufactures in-house in Sydney rather than outsourcing to Asia. The Lectrosonics acquisition (Rio Rancho, New Mexico) gives the group a US manufacturing base — [[Peter Freedman]] stated intent to shift Americas-bound production there and reshore [[Mackie]] products that had moved to Asia.

## Capital structure

A [[Bootstrapped conglomerates|bootstrapped conglomerate]] — zero external investment rounds, no VC, no PE, no debt financing on record. [[Peter Freedman]] retains 100% ownership. All five acquisitions (Aphex 2017, SoundField 2018, Mackie 2022, Lectrosonics 2025, plus Crate) funded from operating cash flow. Unusual at this scale — $500M+ in capex, 800+ employees, 7 brands, manufacturing on two continents — without ever diluting or leveraging.

---

## Competitive landscape

Competes with [[Shure]], [[Sennheiser]], [[Audio-Technica]], [[Sony]], and [[Yamaha]] in the broader pro-audio space. RØDE has differentiated on price-performance for the creator economy (podcasters, YouTubers, filmmakers) while the Lectrosonics acquisition adds high-end film/broadcast wireless credibility.
