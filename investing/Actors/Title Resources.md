## Doma Holdings acquisition

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Target | [[Doma Holdings]] |
| Date | September 2024 |
| Context | Doma failed post-SPAC, needed buyer |
| Assets acquired | Technology platform, operations |

**Doma background:**
- Went public via SPAC (2021) at ~$3B valuation
- "Instant title" machine learning approach
- Collapsed as rates rose, volume dropped
- Title Resources acquired distressed assets

**Strategic rationale:** Title Resources gains technology capabilities without R&D spend. Doma's tech now powers a traditional underwriter.

- Title Resources' acquisition shows traditional players absorbing proptech innovation
- Pattern: Proptech builds → fails → traditional player acquires cheap

**Not directly investable** — private company.
