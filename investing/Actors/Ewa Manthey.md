## Current views (2026)

**Headline thesis:** "Energy cools as metals heat up."

| Commodity | View | Detail |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [[Gold]] | Bullish | $4,100/oz Q1 2026. Central bank buying + rate cuts |
| [[Copper]] | Bullish | 600kt deficit in 2026 (vs 200kt in 2025). Supply disruptions biting |
| Aluminum | Bullish | [[China]] nearing 45Mt self-imposed production cap. Tight market |
| [[Nickel]] | Bearish | Persistent surplus, prices under pressure. $15,250 avg forecast |
| [[Oil]] | Bearish | "Fairly bearish view on energy markets" |

**New metals era drivers:** Diversified demand (electrification, defense, digital infrastructure), constrained/politicized supply, increased volatility from geopolitics and decarbonization, growing role of stockpiling and defense spending.

On [[China]]: "China has become the center of short-term price formation in metals... positioning and momentum play a bigger role, leading to more volatility."
