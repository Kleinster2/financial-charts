BHP — World's largest mining company by market cap (~$161B). [[Iron ore]] (~50% of EBITDA), [[Copper]] (~45%), met coal, and potash. Pivoting toward "future-facing commodities" — [[Copper]] now >2 Mtpa after the OZ Minerals acquisition. Jansen potash project in [[Canada]] is the major growth bet. ASX/NYSE: BHP.

## Price vs mining peers (since 2020)

![[bhp-vs-rio-vale-fsugy-price-chart.png]]
*BHP has tracked [[Rio Tinto]] closely since 2020, with both lagging [[Fortescue]]'s higher-beta iron ore leverage. [[Vale]] underperformed all three through mid-2025 before rallying sharply. BHP's lower volatility reflects its diversification.*

## Iron ore — Western Australia (WAIO)

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026 guidance |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Production (BHP share) | ~255 Mt | 257 Mt (record) | 251-262 Mt |
| Production (100% basis) | ~290 Mt | ~290 Mt (record) | 284-296 Mt |
| C1 unit cost | US$15.84/t | — | — |

BHP operates WAIO through four JVs (Newman, Jimblebar, Mining Area C, Mt Goldsworthy). BHP holds 85%; Mitsui and ITOCHU hold 15%. Key mines: Newman, Jimblebar, Mining Area C / South Flank (80 Mtpa, reached full capacity FY2025). Medium-term target: >305 Mtpa, studying up to 330 Mtpa.

WAIO has been the lowest-cost major iron ore producer for five consecutive years. BHP claims an $8/t cash margin advantage over the nearest Pilbara competitor.

## [[Copper]] expansion

Total copper production crossed 2 Mtpa for the first time in FY2025 (record). [[Copper]] contributed ~45% of underlying EBITDA in FY2025 (up from ~29% / US$8.6B in FY2024) — the highest copper profit share among the iron ore majors. For comparison: [[Rio Tinto]] at ~15% (US$3.4B), [[Vale]] still small (copper EBITDA not separately disclosed).

| Asset | Ownership | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Escondida ([[Chile]]) | 57.5% | World's largest copper mine. ~1,125 kt total FY2024. 18% unit cost reduction FY2025 |
| Olympic Dam ([[Australia]]) | 100% | World's largest uranium deposit + major copper. Record 322 kt FY2024 (+39%). $840M growth investment announced Oct 2025 |
| Prominent Hill ([[Australia]]) | 100% | Via OZ Minerals (A$9.6B, May 2023). Concentrate feeds Olympic Dam smelter |
| Carrapateena ([[Australia]]) | 100% | Via OZ Minerals. Record mine and concentrator performance |
| Spence ([[Chile]]) | 100% | Record production FY2024 |

## Potash — Jansen ([[Canada]])

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stage 1 capacity | ~4.15 Mtpa |
| Original capex | US$5.7B (approved Aug 2021) |
| Updated capex | US$8.4B (Jan 2026 revision, +$2.7B overrun) |
| Completion | 75% |
| First production | Mid-2027 (delayed from 2026) |
| Expected EBITDA margin | ~63-64% |
| Stage 2 | $4.9B approved, first production potentially 2031 |
| Ultimate capacity | 16-17 Mtpa (4 stages) |

Cost overruns from inflation, scope changes, and productivity issues. Payback period: 11-15 years from first production.

## Coal — BMA

50/50 JV with Mitsubishi. [[Australia]]'s largest seaborne met coal producer. Divested Blackwater and Daunia mines to Whitehaven Coal for $4.1B (April 2024) plus up to $900M in price-linked earnouts. Post-divestment, premium hard coking coal is 86% of BMA's sales.

Mt Arthur Coal (thermal): retained, targeting responsible closure by 2030.

## Financials

|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | — | US$55.7B | US$51.3B |
| Underlying EBITDA | — | US$29.0B | US$26.0B |
| Underlying profit | — | US$13.7B | US$10.2B |

| Dividends | — | US$7.4B (54% payout) | US$5.6B (55% payout) |
| ROCE | — | 27% | 20.6% |

FY2024 statutory net income depressed by ~$5.8B in exceptionals (Samarco dam provisions, nickel impairments). FY2025 cleaner but lower on weaker iron ore and coal prices.

## Anglo American bid (failed)

Three unsolicited proposals in April-May 2024, valuing [[Anglo American]] at ~$49B. All rejected — Anglo cited undervaluation and structural complexity (required demerging Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore first). BHP walked away May 29, 2024. Made another approach late 2025, again rejected after Anglo entered its merger agreement with [[Teck Resources]]. BHP permanently withdrew November 2025.

|------|------|
| CEO | Mike Henry (since Jan 2020; expected to step down mid-2026) |

## Investment case

Bull:
- Most diversified major miner — [[Copper]] now 45% of EBITDA
- Lowest-cost iron ore producer (5 consecutive years)
- >2 Mtpa copper production (Escondida + Olympic Dam + OZ Minerals assets)
- Jansen potash opens new commodity vertical (~4 Mtpa mid-2027)
- Disciplined capital returns (50-55% payout ratio)
- Strong FCF: US$8.9B in FY2025 despite lower prices
- Olympic Dam $840M growth investment

Bear:
- [[China]] iron ore dependency (WAIO is ~50% of EBITDA)
- Jansen $2.7B cost overrun ($8.4B vs. $5.7B original)
- Potash payback 11-15 years — long duration bet
- CEO transition uncertainty (mid-2026)
- Queensland coal royalties (~62% effective tax rate on BMA)
- Failed Anglo American bid left copper growth reliant on organic pipeline
- Nickel impairments signal commodity selection risk
