# Burberry

**British luxury house** — iconic trench coats, check pattern. Deep turnaround under new CEO Joshua Schulman (from Jul 2024) after revenue collapsed -15% and the company swung to a £66M loss in FY25. "Burberry Forward" strategy pivots back to heritage outerwear. Stock recovered from ~600p lows to ~1,100-1,200p but remains far below 2023 highs.

## The collapse (2024)

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Profit warning | Jan 2024 | Stock -15% |
| FY24 profit -34% | May 2024 | Brand in crisis |
| Q1 FY25 revenue -22% | Jul 2024 | CEO Jonathan Akeroyd fired |
| Joshua Schulman hired | Jul 2024 | Ex-Michael Kors/Coach CEO |
| FY25 loss, dividend cut | Nov 2024 | Stock hit ~600p (multi-year low) |

**What went wrong:** Under previous leadership, Burberry tried to push upmarket toward "absolute luxury" — abandoning its heritage and core customer. Daniel Lee's creative direction was too conceptual, alienating the brand's accessible luxury base without winning ultra-high-net-worth customers.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Schulman has turnaround credibility (Coach, Michael Kors)
- Heritage assets (trench, check) are genuinely iconic
- Stock at 14-year lows, priced for failure
- Cost cuts providing margin floor
- Q2 FY26 comps +2% = inflection

**Bear:**
- Still loss-making (reported basis)
- Free cash flow negative in H1 FY26
- Creative direction unclear (Daniel Lee still in post)
- Luxury downturn may delay recovery
- 1,700 job cuts risk morale/creativity
- Valuation not cheap vs. peers (Kering at similar discount)
