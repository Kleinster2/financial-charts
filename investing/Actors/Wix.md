## Base44 acquisition (June 2025)

Acquired [[Base44]] for ~$80M cash + earn-out through 2029. AI app builder (vibe coding) — 250K users, 6 employees, zero VC funding, bootstrapped by solo founder Maor Shlomo. Extends Wix from "build a website" to "build anything." Base44 continues as a distinct product.

## Super Bowl LX (Feb 2026)

Returned to the Super Bowl after a 7-year hiatus (previously 2015-2019). Bought a double feature: one spot for Wix Harmony ("The New Way to Create," feat. Candi Staton's "You Got the Love") and one for [[Base44]] ("It's App to You"). This Super Bowl had 7 AI platform ads vs 6 beer+auto combined — Wix is repositioning as an AI company, not just a website builder.
