## Strategic direction: "New Frontier"

MetLife is pivoting *away* from the volatile retail life/annuity business toward:
1. **Group Benefits** — employer-sponsored, steady, high-retention
2. **Retirement Solutions** — institutional pension products, PRT
3. **International** — Asia/LatAm growth (less competitive than US)
4. **Asset management** — targeting $1T+ AUM

This is the *opposite* direction from PE-owned insurers who are *scaling* annuity origination. MetLife is de-risking where [[Athene]]/[[Apollo]] are aggressively growing.

## Variable annuity de-risking (2025)

MetLife reinsured ~$10B of US retail variable annuity and rider reserves to Talcott Resolution (completed Dec 2025). This released ~$250M of capital and continues the strategy of shedding guaranteed-return products.

**Relevance to [[PE-insurance convergence]]:** MetLife is a *seller* of insurance blocks — exactly what PE-linked reinsurers like [[Fortitude Re]] and [[Athene]] buy. Traditional insurers shedding liabilities = supply for the PE platforms.
