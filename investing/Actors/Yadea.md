## What makes Yadea, Yadea

1. **Scale dominance** — 13M+ units/year. Bigger than next 20 competitors combined. Seven production sites across China + Vietnam factory
2. **Cost leadership** — vertically integrated (motors, controllers, frames). Volume drives component costs below what competitors can match
3. **Replacement cycle tailwind** — China's 2019 national standards forced ~300M registered two-wheelers to upgrade from lead-acid to lithium. Multi-year demand wave
4. **Distribution density** — tens of thousands of dealer points across China's tier 1-5 cities
5. **Brand + celebrity** — Vin Diesel endorsement deal, Porsche Design collaboration (VF F200, 2023)

## Financials

| Year | Revenue (RMB) | Volume | Net income (RMB) | Notes |
|------|---------------|--------|------------------|-------|
| 2022 | ~34.7B | 16.5M | ~2.7B | Peak volume |
| 2023 | ~34.7B | 16.5M | ~2.7B | Strong year |
| 2024 | 28.2B | 13.0M | ~1.3B | -19% rev, -51% profit, replacement cycle pause |
| H1 2025 | ~17.5B | 8.8M | ~1.5B | +33% rev, +60% profit, recovery |
| 2025E (guidance) | — | — | ≥2.9B | Profit guidance: at least 2.3x 2024 |

**2024 weakness:** First revenue/profit decline since 2018. Replacement cycle post-2019 standards ran its course; pent-up demand exhausted. H1 2025 recovery suggests a new growth phase or stimulus effect.

**Margins:** Gross margin improved from 18.0% to 19.6% (H1 2025), reflecting product mix shift toward premium.

## Strategic initiatives

### Gogoro battery-swap JV

Yadea + [[Gogoro]] + Dachangjiang Group (DCJ) formed a $50M joint venture to bring Gogoro's battery-swapping network to China. Yadea builds vehicles using Gogoro Network batteries, drivetrains, and controllers. If successful, could unlock massive TAM for battery-swap-as-a-service in China's 300M+ two-wheeler market.

### Graphene batteries

In 2021, Yadea introduced proprietary graphene batteries capable of operating at -20°C. Addresses cold-climate range anxiety — a barrier to adoption in northern China.

### International expansion

Vietnam production (since 2019). Exports to 80 countries. But international remains <5% of revenue — nearly 100% China domestic. Opportunity and risk: if China market saturates, international growth is unproven.

## Key risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **China concentration** | 97% domestic revenue; any macro slowdown hits directly |
| **Replacement cycle exhaustion** | 2024 showed what happens when pent-up demand fades |
| **Price war** | AIMA, Tailg, and dozens of competitors compete on volume |
| **Regulation** | Standards changes can disrupt demand patterns |
| **International unproven** | <5% of revenue despite 80-country presence |
