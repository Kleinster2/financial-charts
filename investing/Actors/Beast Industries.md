## Business segments

### Content / media

The core flywheel: YouTube videos fund brand awareness, which drives CPG sales, which fund bigger videos. Main channel averages ~100–730M monthly views depending on release cadence. Beast Games on [[Amazon]] Prime Video is one of the platform's largest unscripted shows — Season 2 premiered Jan 2026, renewed through Season 3. Production budgets are extreme (S1 cost $100M+), and the media arm reportedly lost ~$80M in 2024 despite strong top-line revenue.

Channels include the main MrBeast channel, MrBeast Gaming (44M+ subs), Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (Shorts), and Beast Philanthropy. International dubs span 16 languages. Total monthly views across all channels: ~5B.

### Feastables (CPG)

The most profitable segment. Chocolate and snack bars sold in 30,000+ retail locations ([[Walmart]], Target, 7-Eleven) across US, Canada, Mexico.

| Year | Revenue | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 2022 | $33M | Launch year |
| 2023 | $96M | 191% YoY |
| 2024 | ~$250M | ~$20M+ profit |
| 2025E | $520M | Investor projection |

Margins reportedly 2x industry average due to zero traditional ad spend — content is the marketing. Competes directly with [[Hershey]], [[Mondelez]], and other legacy confectioners who lack comparable owned-audience distribution.

### Lunchly

Meal kit JV with KSI and Logan Paul (the Prime energy drink founders). Competes with Kraft Heinz's Lunchables. $5M revenue in first 11 weeks post-launch. Early innings.

### Fintech

Beast Industries acquired Gen-Z banking app Step on Feb 9, 2026. FDIC-insured through Evolve Bank & Trust. "MrBeast Financial" trademark filed Oct 2025 covering crypto exchange, consumer lending, and financial advisory services. The play: monetize the 466M-subscriber audience with financial products.

### Other

- Beast Mobile — MVNO, pre-launch
- Viewstats — SaaS creator analytics tool
- Beast Land — temporary theme park in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Nov–Dec 2025)
- James Patterson book collaboration — HarperCollins, publishing 2026

## Controversies

- Beast Games class action (Sep 2024) — contestants alleged mistreatment and unpaid expenses
- Ava Kris Tyson (Jul 2024) — former cast member removed after grooming allegations; Quinn Emanuel investigation cleared all parties (Nov 2024)
- Chichen Itza filming (May 2025) — Mexican authorities investigated rule violations at archaeological site
- Viewstats AI thumbnail tool (Jun 2025) — pulled after plagiarism criticism

## Investment lens

The bull case is that Beast Industries is building a vertically integrated media-to-commerce conglomerate with no historical parallel — 466M subscribers is a distribution moat that lets Feastables grow at 2x industry margins with zero ad spend. The fintech pivot (Step acquisition, MrBeast Financial trademark) adds a high-margin revenue stream against a captive Gen-Z audience. If the IPO materializes, the $5B private valuation implies ~5.6x 2025E revenue.

The bear case: the entire edifice depends on one person's brand. The media arm lost $80M in 2024 on a ~$250M revenue base — content production costs are escalating. Feastables' zero-ad-spend advantage only works while the YouTube audience keeps growing. The controversies (Beast Games lawsuits, Tyson scandal) show reputational fragility. And fintech is a regulated, capital-intensive business that doesn't obviously synergize with chocolate bars and YouTube stunts.
