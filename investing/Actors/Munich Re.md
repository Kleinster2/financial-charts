## Relevance to PE-insurance convergence

Munich Re represents the *traditional* side of reinsurance — the incumbent model that PE firms are challenging:

| Traditional (Munich Re) | PE-owned (Athene/ACRA) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Balance sheet risk-taking | Third-party sidecar capital |
| Conservative investment portfolio | [[Private credit]] / alternatives |
| Regulated (Solvency II) | Bermuda-domiciled, lighter touch |
| Earned reputation over 140 years | Built in 15 years |

Munich Re's strength is in **P&C catastrophe** — natural disaster risk that PE firms largely avoid (unpredictable, lumpy losses). The PE-owned platforms dominate in **life/annuity** where liabilities are predictable and investable.

Munich Re also participates in the ILS/sidecar market as a sponsor — its own ILS vehicles provide capacity for peak catastrophe risks.
