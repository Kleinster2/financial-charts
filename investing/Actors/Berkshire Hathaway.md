## Performance and alpha debate

| Period | Annual alpha vs R1000V | t-stat |
|--------|----------------------|--------|
| 1981–2002 | +16.8% | 3.13 (significant) |
| 2003–2025 | ~0% or negative | <2.0 (not significant) |

Berkshire's Sharpe ratio of 0.76 is the highest of any stock or fund with a 30+ year history. But the [[Buffett's Alpha]] paper (Frazzini, Kabiller & Pedersen) showed this alpha becomes insignificant after controlling for leverage (~1.6x via insurance float) and systematic tilts toward low-beta, high-quality stocks.

[[Chamath Palihapitiya]] argued (Feb 2026) that the performance break aligns with [[Regulation Fair Disclosure]] — pre-2000, selective disclosure of material info to favored investors was legal, and Buffett had extraordinary corporate access. Post-Reg FD, that edge disappeared.

More likely a combination: Reg FD removed information advantages, but size constraints ($900B+ market cap), factor crowding (quality/value widely replicated), cash drag ($347B+ pile), and sector mismatch (underweight tech) would have eroded alpha regardless.
