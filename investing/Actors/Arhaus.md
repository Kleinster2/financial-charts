## Risks

- Tariff exposure — projected $12M cost in 2025, $50–60M in 2026 (mitigating via vendor negotiations, sourcing shifts, pricing)
- Housing cycle sensitivity — premium furniture tied to home purchases and remodeling
- Dual-class structure — Reed family controls voting; limited shareholder influence
- Valuation — stock at $11.10 vs $13 IPO price; 52-week range $6.61–$12.98

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Founder-led for nearly 40 years — deep alignment
- Differentiated sourcing model (direct artisan relationships)
- Net cash balance sheet ($262M cash, no debt)
- In-home designer program is a high-conversion moat
- Showroom expansion runway (103 today, adding 4–6/year)
- Sustainability positioning aligns with consumer trends

Bear:
- Revenue declined in 2024 — housing/macro sensitivity
- Tariff headwinds ($50–60M in 2026) could pressure margins
- Stock well below IPO price — market skepticism
- Dual-class structure limits outside shareholder governance
- Premium furniture is discretionary — vulnerable in downturns
- EPS expected to decline 5.6% in 2026 despite revenue growth
