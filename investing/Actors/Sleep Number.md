# Sleep Number

Vertically integrated smart-bed company selling direct-to-consumer through ~550 owned retail stores and online. Founded 1987 as Select Comfort, rebranded 2017. Known for adjustable air-chamber mattresses with individualized firmness settings ("Sleep Number" setting) and the 360 Smart Bed with [[SleepIQ]] biometric tracking. Revenue peaked at $2.2B in FY2022 during the COVID home-spending boom; now in severe decline (~$1.4B guided for FY2025) with negative equity, ~$580M drawn on its credit facility, and the stock down ~95% from its 2021 all-time high of $147. New CEO [[Linda Findley]] (ex-[[Blue Apron]], ex-[[Etsy]]) took over April 2025 with a cost-cutting and turnaround mandate. Q4 FY2025 results due February 25, 2026.

## Ownership

| Shareholder | Stake | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| [[Stadium Capital]] Management | ~11.5% | Largest shareholder. Entered cooperation agreement March 2025 — withdrew rival board nominees in exchange for 5 director retirements and board overhaul |
| [[BlackRock]] | ~7-8% | Index/passive |
| [[Vanguard]] | ~6-7% | Index/passive |
| [[Dimensional Fund Advisors]] | ~5-6% | Quantitative/small-cap |
| Short interest | ~29.6% of float | ~6.7M shares short (per NASDAQ data, late 2025) |

Stadium Capital's March 2025 agreement was the key governance event: five long-tenured directors retired, the board is declassifying, and Stadium withdrew its own director nominations in a negotiated settlement. The high short interest reflects deep skepticism about the turnaround and balance sheet.

## Financials

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Growth | Gross Margin | Net Income ($M) | EPS |
|------|-------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| FY2019 | 1.70 | — | ~62% | — | — |
| FY2020 | 1.59 | -6.5% | — | — | — |
| FY2021 | 1.86 | +18% | — | — | — |
| FY2022 | 2.18 | +17% | ~61% | — | — |
| FY2023 | 1.89 | -13% | ~58% | — | — |
| FY2024 | 1.68 | -11% | ~59% | -$20M | — |
| FY2025E | ~1.40 | -17% | ~59-60% | loss | -$0.98E |

Revenue has declined 36% from the $2.18B peak (FY2022) to the ~$1.4B expected for FY2025 — four consecutive years of contraction. Gross margins have held ~59-60%, reflecting the pricing power of the DTC model, but the topline collapse has overwhelmed the cost structure.

### Q3 FY2025 (reported Nov 5, 2025)

| Metric | Q3 FY2025 | Q3 FY2024 | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Net sales | $343M | $427M | -19.6% |
| Gross profit | $205M | $259M | -$54M |
| Gross margin | 59.9% | 60.8% | -90bps |
| Operating expenses | $204M | $249M | -18% |
| EPS | $0.07 | $0.44 | -84% |

The company has cut $130M+ in annual operating costs and expects FY2025 opex of ~$825M, down $135M from FY2024. But cost cuts cannot offset a 20% revenue decline indefinitely.

## Balance sheet

| Metric | Value (Q3 FY2025) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Credit facility drawn | ~$580M |
| Availability remaining | ~$82M |
| Shareholders' equity | -$521M |
| Net leverage ratio | ~6.8x net debt / adj. EBITDA |
| Minimum liquidity covenant | $30M (through Sept 2026) |
| Maturity | Extended to December 3, 2027 (12th amendment, Nov 2025) |

Covenant trajectory: net leverage ratio must step down from 5.25x (Q3 2025) to 4.0x by Q3 2026. Interest coverage ratio must rise from 1.50x to 2.20x over the same period. The company says it expects to comply with the new covenants and generate positive free cash flow in 2026.

The negative equity is structural — years of share buybacks (the company repurchased aggressively during the good years) funded by debt created a balance sheet that cannot absorb a demand shock of this magnitude.

## Business model

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Products | Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed (adjustable air-chamber mattress), Climate360 (temperature control), bases, bedding, pillows |
| Technology | [[SleepIQ]] biometric sensor platform — tracks sleep quality, generates personalized SleepIQ score. 32B+ hours of biometric data collected |
| Distribution | 100% direct-to-consumer: company-owned stores (~550), online, phone |
| Average ticket | Often exceeds $5,000 when paired with adjustable bases |
| Recurring revenue | Extended warranties ($62M in FY2022), digital subscriptions ($27M in FY2022), sleep technology services ($178M in FY2022) |
| Manufacturing | Vertically integrated; manufactures in U.S. |
| Delivery | Company-operated home delivery network |

The DTC model gives Sleep Number ~60% gross margins (vs ~40-45% for wholesale mattress companies) but requires a fixed-cost store and delivery infrastructure that becomes a burden when demand falls. With ~550 stores and company-operated delivery, the operating leverage works in reverse during a downturn.

## Evolution

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1987 | Robert and JoAnn Walker found Select Comfort in Minneapolis, building on air-chamber mattress technology from Comfortaire Corporation |
| 1991 | Launches Original Select Comfort Bed |
| 1992 | Opens first retail kiosk in a Twin Cities mall |
| 1998-99 | IPO on NASDAQ (ticker SCSS/AIRB). Raised capital at $17/share |
| 2010 | Rebrands all stores to "Sleep Number" name |
| 2012 | [[Shelly Ibach]] becomes CEO. Begins transition from commodity air beds to technology platform |
| 2013 | Acquires Comfortaire Corporation (the original air-bed pioneer) |
| 2014 | Launches [[SleepIQ]] technology — the smart-bed pivot. Moves from selling mattresses to selling a data-driven sleep platform |
| 2017 | Corporate rebrand: Select Comfort becomes Sleep Number Corporation (NASDAQ: SNBR). Launches 360 Smart Bed with automatic sensing and foot warming |
| 2019 | Revenue reaches $1.7B. Store count exceeds 600. All-in on DTC — exits last wholesale channels |
| 2020-21 | COVID home-spending boom. Stock rallies from ~$15 (March 2020 low) to $147 (March 2021 ATH) — a 10x move. Revenue hits $1.86B in FY2021 |
| 2022 | Revenue peaks at $2.18B. Company repurchases shares aggressively at elevated prices, adding debt |
| 2023 | Demand collapses as COVID pull-forward reverses and housing market freezes. Revenue drops to $1.89B. Stock falls below $30 |
| Nov 2023 | Announces restructuring: 500 layoffs (10% of workforce), 40-50 store closures planned for 2024, $50M cost reduction target |
| Oct 2024 | [[Shelly Ibach]] announces retirement after 12 years as CEO |
| March 2025 | [[Linda Findley]] named CEO. [[Stadium Capital]] cooperation agreement overhauls board (5 directors retire) |
| April 2025 | Findley takes over. Launches $130M+ cost reduction program. Revenue continues declining (~-20% YoY) |
| Aug 2025 | Stock hits all-time low of $3.49. Market cap falls below $100M |
| Nov 2025 | 12th amendment to credit agreement extends maturity to Dec 2027. Q3 shows continued ~20% revenue decline |
| Feb 2026 | HQ building in Minneapolis sold for $235M (converted to data center by new owner). Stock jumps 12.8% on the news. Q4 FY2025 results due Feb 25 |

The core narrative: Ibach transformed a commodity air-mattress retailer into a tech-enabled smart-bed company with premium pricing and 60% gross margins. The model worked brilliantly during the COVID boom but was built on a fixed-cost DTC infrastructure (stores + delivery fleet) that requires volume to sustain. When the post-COVID demand reversal hit simultaneously with a frozen housing market, the operating leverage reversed and the debt-laden balance sheet (from buybacks at peak prices) created a potential liquidity crisis.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Ticker | Revenue | Model | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| [[Tempur-Sealy International]] | TPX | ~$5.3B (2024) | Wholesale + retail. Acquired [[Mattress Firm]] (Feb 2025, ~3,000 stores) | Dominant. ~20-25% market share. 29.5% operating margins. Now vertically integrated post-Mattress Firm |
| [[Purple Innovation]] | PRPL | ~$490M | Wholesale + DTC. Grid technology. | Also struggled post-COVID. EV/revenue ~0.57x vs SNBR's ~0.79x |
| [[Casper Sleep]] | (acquired) | — | DTC bed-in-a-box. | Acquired by [[Durational Capital]] in 2022 for $286M after failed DTC-only model |
| Serta Simmons Bedding | private | ~$2B+ | Wholesale. Emerged from Ch 11 (2023) | 15-20% market share. Restructured debt |
| [[Mattress Firm]] | (TPX subsidiary) | — | Retail. ~3,000 stores | Now owned by [[Tempur-Sealy International]]. Emerged from Ch 11 (2018) separately |

Sleep Number's competitive position is unique but increasingly fragile: it is the only pure-play DTC smart-bed company at scale, but [[Tempur-Sealy International]]'s Mattress Firm acquisition creates a vertically integrated competitor with 5x the store count and far stronger financials. The mattress industry has seen serial distress ([[Casper Sleep]], Serta Simmons, [[Mattress Firm]]) — Sleep Number fits the pattern of a category where fixed costs and cyclicality create recurring crises.

## Charts

![[snbr-price-chart.png]]
*SNBR since 2019. The COVID home-spending boom drove a 10x rally from ~$15 (March 2020) to $147 (March 2021 ATH). The entire move has been given back and then some — stock now at $8.79, down 94% from peak. All-time low of $3.49 hit August 2025.*

![[snbr-fundamentals-chart.png]]
*Quarterly revenue and net income. Revenue peaked ~$650M/quarter in 2021-2022, now running ~$340M. Net income turned negative in 2023 and has remained there. The revenue trajectory shows no stabilization yet.*

## Current situation (Feb 2026)

Turnaround thesis: New CEO [[Linda Findley]] is running a classic cost-restructuring playbook — $130M+ in annualized cost cuts, store closures (from 650+ to ~550), 10% workforce reduction, extended credit facility maturity. Gross margins have held at ~60%. The bet is that demand stabilizes in 2026 (consensus: ~$1.46B revenue) and the lower cost base converts to positive free cash flow.

Risks:
- Revenue is still declining ~20% YoY with no visible demand inflection
- Only $82M available on the credit facility with $30M minimum liquidity covenant
- Net leverage at 6.8x with step-down covenants requiring 4.0x by Q3 2026 — this requires a significant EBITDA improvement in 6 months
- Negative equity (-$521M) means no cushion for further deterioration
- Short interest at ~30% of float reflects widespread skepticism
- [[Linda Findley]]'s prior turnaround ([[Blue Apron]]) ended in a sale, not a standalone recovery
- The housing market (which drives mattress replacement cycles) remains constrained by rates

Catalysts:
- Q4 FY2025 earnings (Feb 25, 2026) — first full look at holiday quarter demand under new management
- Any housing/rates improvement would directly benefit mattress demand
- HQ building data center conversion is a one-time asset monetization event (building sold for $235M in Feb 2026)
- 2026 consensus estimates ($1.46B revenue, $0.46 EPS) — if achievable, implies a dramatic earnings inflection from -$0.98 in FY2025
