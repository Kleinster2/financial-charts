## Why Jack Ma matters

The arc of Jack Ma is the arc of Chinese tech itself — explosive growth, global ambition, then the Party's reassertion of control.

## The Bund Speech (Oct 2020)

The moment everything changed. At the Bund Summit in Shanghai, Ma publicly criticized:
- China's banking system as "pawnshop mentality"
- Basel III regulations as unsuitable for innovation
- Financial regulators as stifling fintech

**Result:** Xi Jinping personally ordered Ant's $37B IPO halted two days before listing. Triggered a multi-year crackdown on China's entire tech sector.

**Lesson:** No Chinese billionaire is bigger than the Party.
