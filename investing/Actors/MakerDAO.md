**MakerDAO** — Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on [[Ethereum]] that issues the DAI/USDS stablecoin (~$3.6B market cap). Unlike [[Tether]] and [[Circle]], DAI is crypto-collateralized and governed by MKR token holders rather than a centralized company. Rebranded to Sky Protocol in 2024 with USDS replacing DAI as the primary stablecoin.
