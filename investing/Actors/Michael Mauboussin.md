## Key ideas

### Skill vs luck
Markets involve both skill and luck. Understanding the ratio matters for:
- Evaluating track records
- Setting expectations
- Designing incentives

### Expectations investing
Stock prices embed expectations about future performance. Investment edge comes from identifying where consensus expectations are wrong — not from predicting the future per se.

### Intangibles
Modern economy increasingly driven by intangible assets (software, brands, networks). Traditional accounting understates investment, overstates earnings. Implications for value investing.

### Complexity
Markets are complex adaptive systems. Insights from Santa Fe Institute research on networks, emergence, and non-linear dynamics apply to investing.
