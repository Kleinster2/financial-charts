## Why JPMorgan matters for AI infra

JPMorgan is the most active bank in AI data center financing:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Assets | $4T+ (largest US bank) |
| Role | Construction financing, syndication lead |
| Key deal | Crusoe $2.3B construction loan |
| Position | First call for large DC deals |

---

## AI infrastructure deals

| Deal | Role | Size |
|------|------|------|
| **Crusoe Abilene** | Lead arranger | $2.3B construction |
| Various DC projects | Syndicate lead | Multi-billion |
| Hyperscaler facilities | Bridge/construction | Ongoing |

**Pattern:** JPMorgan leads, syndicates to other banks, gets fees.

---

## Why JPM leads

**Scale:**
- Balance sheet to underwrite large deals
- Syndication network to distribute risk
- Relationship with PE sponsors (Blue Owl, Blackstone)
- Tech/telecom banking expertise

**DC lending fit:**
- Real asset collateral
- Creditworthy sponsors
- Long-term infrastructure = bank-friendly
- Fees + spread income

---

## Construction vs permanent financing

| Phase | Provider | JPM role |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Construction | Banks (JPM) | Lead arranger |
| Permanent/take-out | PE, bonds, CMBS | Sometimes, or exit |

Banks typically do construction (shorter term, higher spread), PE does permanent (longer term).

---

## Risk exposure

**If AI infra cycle turns:**
- JPM has exposure to DC construction loans
- Syndication reduces concentration
- Collateral (land, buildings) provides downside protection
- But: GPU-backed loans riskier (depreciation)

**Relative to PE:**
- Less concentrated than Blue Owl (DC-focused)
- DC lending is small % of JPM's $4T balance sheet
- More diversified, less levered to AI thesis

---

## Other banks in AI infra

| Bank | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **Goldman Sachs** | Advisory, syndication |
| **Morgan Stanley** | Advisory, research |
| **Bank of America** | Syndicate participant |
| **Citi** | Syndicate participant |
| **Wells Fargo** | Some DC exposure |

JPM is #1; others participate in syndicates.

## CEO: Jamie Dimon

- Longest-tenured big bank CEO
- Vocal on macro/policy issues
- AI skeptic? (cautious public comments)
- But bank actively financing AI buildout

## Security and Resiliency Initiative

**$1.5T, 10-year national security financing program** (announced Oct 2025):

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total facilitation/financing | $1.5T over 10 years |
| Direct equity investments | Up to $10B from JPM balance sheet |
| Leadership | Todd Combs (ex-Berkshire), Jay Horine |
| Combs start date | January 2026 |

**Four pillars:**
1. Supply Chain & Advanced Manufacturing
2. Defense & Aerospace
3. Energy Independence & Resilience
4. Frontier & Strategic Technologies

27 sub-areas including shipbuilding, nuclear energy, critical minerals, nanomaterials.

**Early deployments:**
- MP Materials — $400M DoD investment (rare earths)
- Perpetua Resources — $75M equity (antimony, first US producer)

**Jamie Dimon rationale:** US over-reliance on "unreliable sources" for critical minerals and manufacturing is "painfully clear."

**Investment angle:** Positions JPM as infrastructure bank for US industrial policy. Could drive deal flow in defense, energy, critical minerals.

## Clean energy M&A outlook (Jan 2026)

**Greg Zdun (Asia Pacific head of energy transition):** "Expect more mergers and acquisitions for renewable assets in 2026 as developers or sellers of projects become more realistic in terms of valuation."

**JPM sees M&A revival drivers:**
- Sellers lowering price expectations
- Data center demand supporting renewables
- Less policy/tariff/rate uncertainty than 2025
- Power demand exceeding expectations → premium for quality assets

**2025 context:**
- Clean energy M&A slumped to lowest since 2017 (55.3 GW)
- Average deal premium: 12% (down from 46% in 2024)
- Overall M&A hit $4.5T (2nd best on record) — renewables missed out

---

## Investment case

**As AI infra play:**
- JPM is not a pure-play
- AI/DC lending is tiny part of business
- Better to own Blue Owl, Blackstone for AI exposure
- JPM is diversified bank bet, not AI bet

**General JPM thesis:**
- Best-in-class bank
- Scale advantages
- But not differentiated on AI specifically

## 2026 IG issuance forecast (Jan 2026)

**JPMorgan strategists forecast record $1.81T US investment-grade issuance in 2026:**

| Metric | 2026E | vs 2025 |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Gross IG issuance** | $1.81T | +17% |
| **Net issuance** | $802B | +54% |
| **Maturities** | ~$1T | Flat |

**Prior record:** $1.76T in 2020.

**Key drivers:**
- AI capital spending boom
- $1T+ debt maturing (refinancing wave)
- M&A revival ($182B supply, +21%)

**Sector forecasts:**

| Sector | 2026E | YoY Change |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Technology** | $252B | **+61%** |
| TMT total | $400B | — |
| Consumer | $135B | +44% |
| Media & Entertainment | $85B | +38% |
| Telecom | $56B | +25% |
| **US banks** | — | **-6%** |

**M&A supply:** $94B announced deals for 2026 + $88B expected. Strategists Nathaniel Rosenbaum and Eric Beinstein: "animal spirits have returned."

**Bank decline:** -6% due to reduced supply needs after supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) reform.

## Credit card rate cap risk (Jan 2026)

Trump proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates (current avg: ~22%).

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| JPM stock reaction | -1%+ on announcement |
| Apple Card exposure | Just acquired $17B portfolio from Goldman |
| Industry warning | 175M accounts could close if cap implemented |

**CFO Jeremy Barnum (Jan 2026):** JPM will "consider all options to fight back" against the proposal, warning it "would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy."

JPM is doubling down on consumer credit (Apple Card) just as regulatory risk rises.

---

## Expense / cost concerns (Jan 2026)

**Dimon vowed to spend what's needed** to avoid losing ground to competitors.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2026 expense guidance | $105B |
| Expense growth since 2019 | +46% |
| Investor concern | Increased scrutiny of costs |

**Q4 IB shortfall:** Investment banking fee income fell short of guidance telegraphed just weeks earlier.

Stock tumbled after Q4 results despite beat — investors worried about expense trajectory and populist policy risks.

## Venezuela opportunity

**60-year presence in Venezuela:**
- Dormant Caracas office maintained — could reactivate as needed
- Currently trades Venezuelan sovereign bonds (non-sanctioned) with offshore counterparties

**If sanctions ease:**
- Internal idea floated: trade bank for oil exports (precedent: Trade Bank of Iraq, 2003)
- Could tap $1.5T Security & Resiliency Initiative for critical minerals financing
- Trade financing, infrastructure investment, restructuring deals

**Advantage:** Among very few US banks with any Venezuela presence.

**Caution:** Even after Iran sanctions lifted (2016), global banks remained reluctant. LatAm is ~2% of JPM revenue.
