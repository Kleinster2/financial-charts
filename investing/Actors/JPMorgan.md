## Why JPMorgan matters for AI infra

JPMorgan is the most active bank in AI data center financing:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Assets | $4T+ (largest US bank) |
| Role | Construction financing, syndication lead |
| Key deal | Crusoe $2.3B construction loan |
| Position | First call for large DC deals |

---

## AI infrastructure deals

| Deal | Role | Size |
|------|------|------|
| **Crusoe Abilene** | Lead arranger | $2.3B construction |
| Various DC projects | Syndicate lead | Multi-billion |
| Hyperscaler facilities | Bridge/construction | Ongoing |

**Pattern:** JPMorgan leads, syndicates to other banks, gets fees.

---

## Why JPM leads

**Scale:**
- Balance sheet to underwrite large deals
- Syndication network to distribute risk
- Relationship with PE sponsors (Blue Owl, Blackstone)
- Tech/telecom banking expertise

**DC lending fit:**
- Real asset collateral
- Creditworthy sponsors
- Long-term infrastructure = bank-friendly
- Fees + spread income

---

## Construction vs permanent financing

| Phase | Provider | JPM role |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Construction | Banks (JPM) | Lead arranger |
| Permanent/take-out | PE, bonds, CMBS | Sometimes, or exit |

Banks typically do construction (shorter term, higher spread), PE does permanent (longer term).

## Risk exposure

**If AI infra cycle turns:**
- JPM has exposure to DC construction loans
- Syndication reduces concentration
- Collateral (land, buildings) provides downside protection
- But: GPU-backed loans riskier (depreciation)

**Relative to PE:**
- Less concentrated than Blue Owl (DC-focused)
- DC lending is small % of JPM's $4T balance sheet
- More diversified, less levered to AI thesis

---

## Other banks in AI infra

| Bank | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **Goldman Sachs** | Advisory, syndication |
| **Morgan Stanley** | Advisory, research |
| **Bank of America** | Syndicate participant |
| **Citi** | Syndicate participant |
| **Wells Fargo** | Some DC exposure |

JPM is #1; others participate in syndicates.

## CEO: Jamie Dimon

- Longest-tenured big bank CEO
- Vocal on macro/policy issues
- AI skeptic? (cautious public comments)
- But bank actively financing AI buildout

---

## Investment case

**As AI infra play:**
- JPM is not a pure-play
- AI/DC lending is tiny part of business
- Better to own Blue Owl, Blackstone for AI exposure
- JPM is diversified bank bet, not AI bet

**General JPM thesis:**
- Best-in-class bank
- Scale advantages
- But not differentiated on AI specifically
