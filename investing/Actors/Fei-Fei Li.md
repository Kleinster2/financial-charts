## Why Fei-Fei Li matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key contribution | **ImageNet** (14M labeled images) |
| Current company | [[World Labs]] ($5B valuation) |
| Academic role | Stanford CS professor, HAI co-director |
| Recognition | TIME Person of the Year 2025 |
| Nickname | "Godmother of AI" |

ImageNet is credited as one of three driving forces behind the modern AI/deep learning revolution.

## ImageNet (2007-2012)

**The dataset that launched deep learning:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Images | **14M+** labeled |
| Categories | 20,000+ |
| Labeling | [[Amazon]] Mechanical Turk |
| Started | 2007 (Princeton) |
| Challenge | ILSVRC (2010-2017) |

**Impact:**
- 2012: [[AlexNet]] won ILSVRC by 10+ points using deep learning
- Sparked the deep learning revolution
- Foundation for: autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging
- One of "three driving forces" of modern AI

**The insight:** AI needed massive labeled datasets, not just better algorithms. Li spent years building what others thought was tedious grunt work.
