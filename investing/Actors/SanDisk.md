## The story

SanDisk invented the consumer flash memory market, then got buried inside [[Western Digital]] for nearly a decade. The Feb 2025 spinoff unlocked a pure NAND play just as AI infrastructure demand exploded.

**The numbers are staggering:**
- Stock up **+1700%** since Feb 2025 spinoff (~$38 → ~$666)
- Revenue up **61% YoY** in Q2 FY2026
- Data center revenue up **64% sequentially**
- Gross margins expanded from 29.9% → 51.1% in one quarter

*vs [[Micron|MU]], [[Western Digital|WDC]] — SNDK has crushed peers since spinoff, benefiting from pure NAND exposure + AI storage demand.*

## History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1988 | Founded by Eli Harari, [[Sanjay Mehrotra]], Jack Yuan |
| 2000 | Toshiba Memory (now [[Kioxia]]) JV formed |
| 2016 | [[Western Digital]] acquires SanDisk for $19B |
| Oct 2024 | WDC announces spinoff plan |
| Feb 2025 | SanDisk relists on NASDAQ at ~$38.50 |
| Aug 2025 | [[SK Hynix]] collaboration on HBF announced |
| Jan 2026 | [[Kioxia]] JV extended to 2034 |

## Leadership

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| CEO & Chair | [[David Goeckeler]] | Ex-WDC CEO, ex-Cisco EVP ($34B networking/security) |
| Board | Devinder Kumar | Audit Committee Chair |
| Board | Ellyn Shook | Compensation Committee Chair |
| Board | Miyuki Suzuki | Governance Committee |

Goeckeler chose to lead SanDisk over WDC in the split — telling signal about which business he saw as more valuable.

## Kioxia partnership

**25-year JV**, now extended to 2034:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Structure | Shared NAND fabs in Yokkaichi & Kitakami, [[Japan]] |
| Economics | Shared capex, separate products |
| Extension | Jan 2026: Extended from 2029 → 2034 |
| Payment | SanDisk paying [[Kioxia]] $1.165B (2026-2029) for manufacturing services |

The partnership provides capital-efficient scale to compete with Korean giants [[Samsung]] and [[SK Hynix]].

## Market position

### NAND market share (Q3 2025, TrendForce)

| Rank | Company | Share | Revenue |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [[Samsung]] | 32.3% | — |
| 2 | [[SK Hynix]] + Solidigm | 19.3% | $3.34B |
| 3 | [[Kioxia]] | 15.3% | — |
| 4 | [[Micron]] | — | $2.42B |
| 5 | **SanDisk** | **12.4%** | $2.31B |

**The gap is closing:** SanDisk's Q2 FY26 revenue of $3.025B would rank higher if annualized.

### Strategic positioning

| vs Competitor | SanDisk advantage | SanDisk weakness |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| [[Samsung]] | Pure-play focus, nimble | Scale, vertical integration |
| [[SK Hynix]] | NAND purity | No [[HBM]] exposure |
| [[Micron]] | Data center focus | No DRAM diversification |
| [[Western Digital]] | No HDD drag | Shared JV coordination |

## Why the spinoff worked

The WDC divorce unlocked "the flash premium":

1. **Pure-play multiple** — Flash assets get AI infrastructure multiple, not HDD-blended discount
2. **Management focus** — Goeckeler 100% on NAND, not splitting attention
3. **Capital allocation** — No HDD capex competing with flash investment
4. **Investor clarity** — Clear thesis for AI storage exposure

**Before:** WDC traded at HDD multiples despite flash being growth driver
**After:** SNDK trades at 40x+ forward P/E as AI storage pure-play

---

## AI storage thesis

SanDisk is a direct beneficiary of [[AI storage bottleneck]]:

- GPUs spend **70% of training time** waiting on I/O
- Data center SSDs critical for feeding AI clusters
- Enterprise NAND demand outstripping supply
- SanDisk seeing "accelerating strength in the data center"

The company's exabyte growth forecast revision (mid-20s% → high-60s%) reflects AI-driven demand inflection.

## Financials

*Note: Limited history — SanDisk spun off Feb 2025. Only two quarters as public company.*

![[sndk-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue and net income ramping sharply — Q2 revenue +31% QoQ, net income +4x.*

### Quarterly results (FY2026)

| Quarter | Revenue | QoQ | YoY | Gross Margin | EPS |
|---------|---------|-----|-----|--------------|-----|
| Q1 FY26 | $2.31B | — | — | 29.9% | — |
| Q2 FY26 | $3.03B | +31% | +61% | 51.1% | $6.20 |
| Q3 FY26E | $4.4-4.8B | +45-58% | — | 65-67% | $12-14 |

The margin expansion from 29.9% → 51.1% → 65-67% reflects NAND pricing power in a supply-constrained market.

## Risks

| Risk | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| NAND cycle | Could turn — memory is cyclical |
| Valuation | 40x+ forward P/E prices in perfection |
| Competition | Samsung, SK Hynix have scale + DRAM/HBM |
| Kioxia dependency | JV concentration in Japan |
| No DRAM/HBM | Missing adjacent AI memory markets |
