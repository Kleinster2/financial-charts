## 2025-2026 performance

**Breakout stock:**

| Period | Return | Note |
|--------|--------|------|
| 2025 | **+559%** | Best S&P 500 performer |
| Jan 2026 | **+70%** | 11 trading days, trading above $400 |
| Catalyst | NAND scarcity + AI storage demand |

**[[CES 2026]]:** Stock soared 37% in one week after [[Jensen Huang]] emphasized memory and storage demand.

**Why it keeps rallying:** NAND scarcity — AI infrastructure requires enormous amounts of high-performance flash storage. As a major NAND producer, SanDisk benefits directly from supply constraints and pricing power.

## AI storage demand

**Why AI needs storage:**
- Training data: Petabytes of datasets
- Model checkpoints: Save/resume training
- Inference: Fast model loading
- Logs/telemetry: Massive output

**[[Jensen Huang]] ([[CES 2026]]):** Highlighted memory and storage as critical alongside compute.
