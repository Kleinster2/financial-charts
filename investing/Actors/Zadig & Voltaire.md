## Investment case

Bull:
- Family-controlled with founder still actively shaping brand
- Differentiated positioning — "new luxury" between [[LVMH]]-tier and fast fashion
- Strong geographic diversification (30/30/25/15 split)
- €550M revenue target implies near-doubling from 2020-21 levels
- Private = no quarterly earnings pressure

Bear:
- Private company — limited financial transparency
- Revenue estimates vary wildly across sources ($250M–$500M range)
- Leadership churn — creative director and CEO both departed 2024
- Online sales modest (~$37M) for a brand of this scale
- Luxury market headwinds from [[China]] slowdown, post-COVID normalization
