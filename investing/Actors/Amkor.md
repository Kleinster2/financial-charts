**Amkor Technology** — \#2 OSAT globally. [[Advanced packaging]]. US-headquartered alternative to ASE.

---

## Why Amkor matters

Second largest packaging/test:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | AMKR |
| Market cap | ~$7B |
| Revenue | ~$6.5B |
| Position | \#2 OSAT globally |
| HQ | Arizona, USA |

---

## OSAT business

**Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test:**
- Package chips after foundry
- Final testing
- [[Advanced packaging]] (2.5D, 3D)
- Substrate manufacturing

Between foundry and customer.

## [[Advanced packaging]]

| Technology | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Flip chip | High-performance |
| 2.5D | [[HBM]] integration |
| Fan-out | Mobile, automotive |
| SiP | System-in-package |

AI chips need advanced packaging.

---

## AI/HPC opportunity

**Packaging bottleneck:**
- Larger AI chips = more complex
- [[HBM]] integration
- CoWoS-like capabilities
- Capacity constrained

Same thesis as [[ASE]].

## Geographic footprint

| Location | Capability |
|----------|------------|
| Korea | Largest facility |
| [[China]] | High volume |
| [[Japan]] | [[Advanced packaging]] |
| Philippines | Assembly |
| Vietnam | Growing |
| Arizona | New US fab |

---

## US manufacturing

**Arizona expansion:**
- [[CHIPS Act]] beneficiary
- US supply chain push
- Intel/US customer proximity
- Onshoring trend

US-headquartered = advantage.

---

## Customer concentration

| Customer | % Revenue |
|----------|-----------|
| Apple | ~20% |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Significant |
| Intel | Growing |
| NVIDIA | Growing |

Apple exposure = iPhone cycles.

## vs ASE

| Metric | Amkor | [[ASE]] |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rank | \#2 | \#1 |
| Market cap | $7B | $20B+ |
| HQ | USA | [[Taiwan]] |
| Apple exposure | Higher | Lower |

Similar thesis, different profile.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Advanced packaging]] demand
- US-headquartered ([[CHIPS Act]])
- AI chip growth
- Capacity constraints = pricing
- Smaller = more upside

**Bear:**
- Apple concentration
- [[Consumer]] slowdown risk
- ASE larger scale
- TSMC in-house packaging
