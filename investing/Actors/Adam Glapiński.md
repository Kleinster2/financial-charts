## Core positions

### Against euro adoption

Glapiński argues Poland should retain the zloty because:

1. **Independent rate-setting:** Polish economy differs from eurozone — faster growth requires different rates
2. **Floating exchange rate:** Absorbs shocks through currency adjustment rather than unemployment/GDP
3. **Euro area is not optimal currency area:** Limited labor mobility, no fiscal federalism, asymmetric shocks
4. **Case study evidence:** Spain unemployment spiked to 25%, Baltic GDP fell 14-16% in 2009 — couldn't devalue

From Nov 2025 report:
> "For the Polish economy, the adoption of the euro would mean a significant increase in the risk of macroeconomic imbalance and a permanent slowdown in economic growth."

### Defense of central bank independence

On political attacks on central banks (Nov 2025):
> "Even when these attacks are merely a part of political rhetoric and do not lead to concrete actions aimed at limiting central bank independence, they are extremely detrimental. This is because they can undermine public confidence in the independent central bank and, as a result, lead to higher inflation expectations, higher inflation, and consequently permanently higher interest rates."

## Nov 2025 report: Key arguments

"The Polish Zloty and the Independence of NBP as the Foundations of Economic Development" (143 pages)

### Part 1: Why keep the zloty

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Poland's convergence success | GDP per capita: 48% of EU avg (2000) → 79% (2024) |
| Own currency enables faster response | NBP raised rates 9 months before ECB |
| Floating rate absorbs shocks | Exchange rate adjusts, not unemployment |
| Euro area not optimal | Diverse economies, no fiscal transfers |
| Case studies | Spain: 25% unemployment; Baltics: -15% GDP |

### Part 2: Central bank independence

| Principle | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Protection from political pressure | Credibility enables lower inflation expectations |
| Historical lessons | 1970s Fed, Turkey, Argentina, Zimbabwe |
| Granting independence works | Global inflation declined after CB independence spread |
| Current threats | Political attacks undermine confidence even without action |

## Quotes

On zloty strength (2024):
> "Anyone investing in Poland, buying Polish bonds, knows they are 100 percent safe. That's why Polish bonds are easy to sell, although their yields do fluctuate."

On monetary independence:
> "The pillar of monetary sovereignty is retaining our own currency, the Polish zloty. By having our own currency with a floating exchange rate, we can adjust interest rates to the needs of the Polish economy."
