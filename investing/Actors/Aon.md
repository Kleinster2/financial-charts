## NFP acquisition (2024)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Price | $13B |
| Focus | Middle-market insurance broking, benefits, wealth |
| Rationale | Expand distribution, compete with Marsh McLennan Agency |

---

## Competitive positioning

Aon differentiates from [[Marsh McLennan]] through:
1. **Analytics-first** — data, modeling, and risk quantification
2. **Reinsurance specialization** — Aon Securities publishes definitive ILS market research
3. **Alternative capital advisory** — helps structure sidecars and cat bonds
4. **Failed WTW merger** (2020-21) — $30B deal blocked by regulators, reshaped strategy
