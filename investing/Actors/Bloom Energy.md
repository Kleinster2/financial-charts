**Bloom Energy** — Solid oxide fuel cells for on-site power. Alternative to grid for data centers.

---

## Why Bloom matters

Bloom offers data centers a way to bypass grid constraints:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Product | Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) |
| Use case | On-site power generation |
| Fuel | Natural gas or hydrogen |
| Value prop | Reliable, grid-independent power |

---

## Data center opportunity

**The problem Bloom solves:**
- [[Power constraints]] — 44GW gap, grid can't deliver
- Hyperscalers need power NOW
- Grid connection takes years
- Bloom: on-site power in months

**How it works:**
- Install Bloom fuel cells at data center
- Generate electricity on-site
- Use natural gas (or hydrogen)
- Bypass grid bottleneck

## SemiAnalysis mention

SemiAnalysis (Dec 2025) identified Bloom as alternative provider filling the power gap:

> "The grid left them on read" — hyperscalers turning to alternatives because utilities can't deliver.

Bloom is one of the "BYOP" (Bring Your Own Power) solutions.

## Technology

**Solid oxide fuel cells:**
- Electrochemical conversion (not combustion)
- Higher efficiency than generators
- Lower emissions than diesel
- Can use natural gas or hydrogen
- Modular, scalable

**Advantages:**
- Reliable (no grid dependency)
- Fast deployment
- Can site anywhere with gas
- 24/7 baseload (unlike solar/wind)

## Data center customers

| Customer | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Equinix | On-site power |
| Various DCs | Grid supplement |
| Enterprise | Critical power |

Growing DC adoption as grid constraints bite.

---

## Hydrogen optionality

**Future play:**
- Fuel cells can run on hydrogen
- If green hydrogen scales, Bloom is positioned
- Currently mostly natural gas
- Hydrogen = zero carbon option

---

## Competitive position

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Bloom (fuel cells)** | Fast deploy, reliable | Fuel cost, capex |
| Grid power | Cheapest | Unavailable |
| Diesel generators | Cheap, fast | Dirty, noisy |
| Solar + battery | Clean | Intermittent |
| Nuclear | Baseload | Slow, expensive |

Bloom wins on speed and reliability when grid unavailable.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Power constraints]] = secular tailwind
- Data center demand growing
- BYOP trend benefits Bloom
- Hydrogen optionality
- Technology proven

**Bear:**
- Fuel cells expensive vs grid
- Natural gas price exposure
- Competition from other solutions
- Profitability challenged
- Stock volatile
