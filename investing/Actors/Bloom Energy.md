## What makes Bloom, Bloom

**Speed kills — and Bloom deploys in under 50 days.** While grid connections take 3-5 years and nuclear takes a decade, Bloom installs box-shaped fuel cell "energy servers" on-site at data centers in weeks. Solid oxide fuel cells convert natural gas to electricity electrochemically (no combustion) — more efficient than generators, cleaner than diesel, available 24/7 unlike solar/wind.

**The flywheel:** Grid can't deliver → hyperscalers need power NOW → Bloom delivers in weeks → proven reliability → more orders → manufacturing scale → costs come down → more competitive vs grid.

**Why now:** The 44 GW power gap identified by SemiAnalysis (Dec 2025) created a massive addressable market. Grid utilities are years behind on connections. Bloom is the fastest available solution for on-site baseload power.

## Financial trajectory

| Metric | Q3 2024 | Q3 2025 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $330M | $519M | +57% |
| Operating income | -$9.7M | +$7.8M | Turnaround |

| Year | Revenue | Net income |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2023 | — | ~-$300M loss |
| 2024 | — | -$29M loss (improving) |
| H1 2025 | — | -$66M loss |
| 2025E | ~$1.9B | Approaching breakeven |
| 2026E | ~$2.46B | — |

**Capital raise:** $2.2B convertible senior notes (dilutive but strengthens balance sheet).

## Manufacturing scale-up

- **Current:** 1.5 GW deployed globally
- **Expansion:** $100M investment (Aug 2025) to double capacity from 1 GW to 2 GW annual production by end 2026
- **Speed advantage:** Installation in under 50 days vs years for grid/nuclear alternatives

---

## Technology

**Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC):**
- Electrochemical conversion (not combustion) — higher efficiency
- Fuel: natural gas today, hydrogen-ready for future
- Modular, scalable — box-shaped "energy servers"
- 24/7 baseload (unlike solar/wind)
- Grid-independent — no utility dependency
- Lower emissions than diesel generators

---

## Competitive position

| Alternative | Deploy time | Baseload? | Grid needed? |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bloom fuel cells** | ~50 days | Yes | No |
| Grid connection | 3-5 years | Yes | Yes |
| Diesel generators | Days | Yes | No (dirty) |
| Solar + storage | Months | Intermittent | No |
| Nuclear (Oklo, NuScale) | 5-10+ years | Yes | Partial |

Bloom wins on **speed + reliability** when grid unavailable.

## 2026 Power Report (Jan 2026)

Bloom published research showing data centers plan to reduce reliance on grid — validates the on-site generation trend and Bloom's core value proposition.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Power constraints]] = massive secular tailwind (44 GW gap)
- Fastest deployment of any baseload solution (50 days)
- $5B Brookfield + $2.7B AEP deals prove demand
- Revenue doubling annually ($519M Q3, $1.9B FY2025E)
- Manufacturing doubling to 2 GW by end 2026
- Ahead of Oklo/NuScale by years on commercialization
- Hydrogen optionality for future carbon-free operation

**Bear:**
- Stock up 550% — valuation at 153x forward earnings, 48x book
- Still losing money (Q3 2025 first operating profit quarter)
- $2.2B convertible dilution
- Natural gas fuel cost exposure
- Technology risk if grid catches up
- Customer concentration (few mega-deals)
