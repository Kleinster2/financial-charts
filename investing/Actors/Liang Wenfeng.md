Reclusive — rarely attends industry parties. Founded [[High-Flyer]] (幻方量化), a Hangzhou-based quant hedge fund, in 2015. Used fund profits to bankroll [[DeepSeek]]'s AI research starting 2023 — self-funded without external VC. DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model (Jan 2025) triggered a global market selloff after demonstrating frontier-level performance at a fraction of US training costs.

State benefit: Hangzhou municipal government designated [[DeepSeek]] as a strategic priority — preferential access to energy quotas and municipal computing centers.

Bloomberg's "at least $1B" estimate reflects uncertainty around his High-Flyer fund holdings and DeepSeek's private valuation. DeepSeek remains private and has not raised external funding — actual net worth likely substantially higher.
