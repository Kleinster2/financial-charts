## Extended Stay debacle (2007-2009)

**The deal:**
- June 2007: Acquired Extended Stay Hotels from [[Blackstone]] for $8B
- 687 hotels, ~76,000 rooms, 44 states + Canada
- Financed with $7B debt, ~$1B equity
- Lichtenstein lacked hotel experience; won bidding vs Centerbridge, Fortress

**The collapse:**
- Great Recession decimated travel
- Extended Stay filed Chapter 11 on June 15, 2009
- Lichtenstein held $7.3B debt, $200M equity
- Triggered "bad boy" clause: $100M personal guarantee due to voluntary bankruptcy filing

**Lessons:**
1. Leverage kills in downturns — $7B debt on $8B deal left no buffer
2. Industry inexperience + peak-cycle timing = disaster
3. Bad-boy clauses are real — bankruptcy can mean personal liability

## Investment philosophy

**Contrarian value approach:** Seeks properties with high return potential and challenges that limit appeal to other investors.

**Track record:** Averaged 30%+ annual returns over much of Lightstone's history. Since 2004: 27.6% IRR, 2.54x equity multiple on realized investments.
