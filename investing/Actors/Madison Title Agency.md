## Agency vs underwriter distinction

**Madison is an agency, not an underwriter.** Critical difference:

| Role | Function | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Underwriter** | Bears insurance risk, issues policies | [[Fidelity National Financial]], [[First American Financial]] |
| **Agency** | Searches titles, conducts closings, places policies with underwriters | Madison Title |

Madison works with multiple underwriters — enabling placement across carriers for large, complex commercial deals.

## Insights

**Commercial real estate focus** — While Big Four underwriters serve all segments, Madison specializes in complex commercial transactions where multi-underwriter placement and specialized services matter.

**MCRES platform** — Title is anchor service; cross-sells related commercial real estate services through sister companies.

**Scale** — First year (1998): 2,500 transactions, $1B insured liability. Now: 10,000+ transactions/year, nationwide.
