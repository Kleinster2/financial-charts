## Evolution

- 1993 — Margalit founds JVP in Jerusalem, betting on Israel's emerging tech ecosystem when most Israeli VC was Tel Aviv-centric
- 2000 — Chromatis Networks sold to Lucent for ~$4.5B, validating the model. Lucent shuts Chromatis down a year later — a cautionary tale of bubble-era valuations, but JVP exits profitably
- 2001 — Closes $400M Fund IV two months after 9/11 — counter-cyclical conviction. LP roster (France Telecom, Infineon, Nortel, Boeing, MIT) shows JVP positioning as corporate-strategic bridge, not just financial VC
- 2006 — Opens JVP Media Quarter at Jerusalem's historic train station — blending startup incubation with urban regeneration. This becomes the Margalit Startup City template
- 2013 — Launches JVP Cyber Labs in Be'er Sheva, Israel's first government-backed cybersecurity incubator. Located near IDF cyber units and Ben-Gurion University. Helps transform Be'er Sheva into a global cyber hub
- 2013-2017 — Margalit enters politics (Knesset, Labor Party). Runs for party leadership in 2017, loses, resigns from Knesset, returns full-time to JVP
- 2014 — [[CyberArk]] IPO on NASDAQ. JVP's signature investment: Round A → 47% ownership → public exit. Stock doubles in 48 hours
- 2018-2020 — Raises $220M Fund VIII and targets $450M Growth Fund X. Expands internationally: NYC hub (50,000 sq ft at 462 Broadway), Paris office at French government invitation
- 2025 — CyberArk acquired by [[Palo Alto Networks]] for $25B — one of the most valuable exits in Israeli VC history. JVP closes $290M Earnix continuation vehicle with [[TPG]], the largest single-asset CV by a VC firm

- Be'er Sheva — JVP Cyber Labs (2013). Government-backed cybersecurity incubator near IDF cyber units and Ben-Gurion University
- Galilee (Kiryat Shmona) — International Foodtech Center. NIS 500M government budget to incentivize food tech relocation. Partnership with JNF-USA, [[Cisco]], Deloitte
- New York — Hub.NYC, 50,000 sq ft at 462 Broadway, SoHo (opened Feb 2020). Part of Cyber NYC initiative — $100M public-private partnership ($30M NYC + $70M private). Selected by NYCEDC in Oct 2018 to run the city's first cybersecurity "scalarator." Climate tech center added Sep 2022 with Mini/URBAN-X
- Paris — Margalit Startup City Paris at invitation of [[France|French]] Finance Minister. Target: 30 Israeli companies initially, 350 over 3-4 years. Cyber, fintech, AI focus

## Analysis

JVP's model — VC as urban regeneration tool — is unusual in venture capital. Most Israeli VCs operate from Tel Aviv. Margalit's deliberate bet on Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva, and the periphery is as much political infrastructure as it is financial.

The CyberArk trajectory is the crown jewel: Round A → secondary with Goldman → 47% ownership → IPO → $25B Palo Alto exit. The willingness to increase ownership over time (rather than diluting) and to lead secondaries to maintain position shows a conviction-based approach uncommon in VC.

The Earnix continuation vehicle ($290M, 8.7x returns, 50%+ ownership) signals the same pattern: concentrate, hold, and manage position exits rather than distributing early. TPG as co-lead on the CV validates institutional confidence in this approach.

The Fund IV timing (closing $400M in November 2001) reveals the counter-cyclical instinct. The NYC and Paris expansions extend the model internationally, but the core engine remains Israeli-origin companies with global ambitions.

Preqin's 6th globally for consistent performance (2017, out of 138 firms) supports the returns narrative, though individual fund-level IRRs are not publicly disclosed.
