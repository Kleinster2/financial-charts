## Feb 24, 2026: Anthropic partnership

Multi-year deal with [[Anthropic]] — the biggest narrative reversal in the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]]:

- **MCP integrations** — TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, Mailchimp surfaced inside Claude, Cowork, and Claude for Enterprise
- **Custom AI agents** — mid-market businesses can build industry-specific agents on Intuit's platform using Claude Agent SDK
- **Claude Code deployment** — Intuit rolling out across engineering organization
- **Rolling out spring 2026**

Stock bounced on the news after being **-47% YTD** from the SaaSpocalypse. The market read: AI labs *need* software companies' domain expertise and compliance frameworks. Partnership > replacement.

**The strategic shift:** Intuit went from being an AI *victim* (Cowork could replace tax/accounting workflows) to an AI *partner* (Intuit's financial intelligence embedded inside Claude). Whether this is a sustainable moat or a slow-motion commoditization into a back-end data provider remains the key question.
