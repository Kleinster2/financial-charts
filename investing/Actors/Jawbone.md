## What went wrong

**Product failures:**
- UP3 (2015) plagued by production delays, quality issues, battery problems
- Couldn't compete on hardware margins against Fitbit, Apple Watch, Xiaomi

**Death by overfunding:**
- Raised too much at too high a valuation
- Burned cash on expansion while losing market share
- Late investors (Kuwait) came in when prospects already dim

**Competition:**
- [[Fitbit]] dominated fitness trackers
- [[Apple Watch]] (2015) redefined the category
- Chinese OEMs undercut on price

**Market share:** Fell below 5% vs. Fitbit's dominance.

## Epstein connection

Hosain Rahman met Jeffrey Epstein at a TED conference. Ian Osborne, an adviser to executives, reconnected them in 2012 and encouraged Epstein to invest.

| Year | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 2012 | $5M |
| 2017 | $11.25M (total holdings) |

The relationship soured after Jawbone's failure:
- Epstein threatened legal action against Rahman
- Hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on him
- Rahman offered Epstein a "senior adviser" role at successor company Jawbone Health to stave off threats

Rahman later said: "Epstein put together a special purpose vehicle to invest in Jawbone, and we wish he hadn't."

## Aftermath

- Liquidated July 2017
- Patents sold to generate partial recovery for investors
- Rahman founded Jawbone Health Hub (clinical health monitoring)
- Ranks as second-largest VC-backed failure after Solyndra
