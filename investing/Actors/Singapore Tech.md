## Why Singapore matters

Strategic positioning:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | 5.9 million |
| GDP per capita | $83,000+ |
| GDP growth 2025 | **+4.8%** (stronger than expected) |
| SWFs | GIC + Temasek (~$1.2T) |
| Tech role | [[Asia]]-Pacific hub |

## Tariff impact (Jan 2026)

**Resilience despite tariffs:**
- GDP +4.8% in 2025 (beat expectations)
- Economists gaming out MAS tightening

**But leadership warns:**
- PM: Tariffs "weren't the act of a friend"
- "Fundamental break from practices of the last half century"
- Country needs to "rethink its development strategy"

Singapore rose to prosperity in free trade era — that era may be ending.
