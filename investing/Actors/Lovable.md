## What makes Lovable work

### The GPT Engineer flywheel

```
Open source (50K stars) → Developer trust →
Commercial launch → Revenue →
Better product → More users
```

**Key insight:** Open source created massive awareness and credibility before commercial launch.

### Growth drivers

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Vibe coding wave** | Non-technical users can now build apps |
| **Supabase integration** | Instant backend provisioning |
| **Enterprise adoption** | Uber, Klarna validate for others |
| **AI model improvements** | Better outputs = more use cases |

### Structural advantages

| Advantage | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Open source origins | Trust, community, awareness |
| European base | Less competition than US |
| Full-stack output | Not just code snippets — working apps |
| Supabase default | Backend friction removed |

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Valuation |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cursor** (Anysphere) | AI code editor | $29B |
| **Bolt.new** | AI app builder | — |
| **v0** ([[Vercel]]) | AI web builder | Part of Vercel |
| **Replit** | AI coding environment | $1B+ |
| [[Builder.ai]] | No-code (collapsed) | Was $1.5B |

**Key distinction:** Lovable is full-stack app generation, not just code completion (Cursor) or components (v0).
