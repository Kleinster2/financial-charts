## Nov 2025: First AI model trained in space

**Starcloud-1 satellite:**
- First **H100 GPU in orbit** (100x more powerful than any prior space GPU)
- Trained **NanoGPT** ([[Andrej Karpathy]]'s model) on Shakespeare
- Ran **[[Google]] Gemma** LLM — first LLM inference in space
- 21 months from founding to launch

**Why it matters:** Proof of concept that high-power AI compute works in orbit.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Specs |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Starcloud-1** | Nov 2025 | 1x H100, proof of concept |
| **Starcloud-2** | Oct 2026 | Multiple H100s + Blackwell, 100x scale |
| **Commercial** | 2027+ | 1 MW solar array |
| **5GW target** | 2028 | 4km × 4km solar panels |

**CEO Philip Johnston:** "Most new data centers will be space-based within a decade."

## The 5GW vision

**Single orbital data center:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Power | 5 GW |
| Solar panels | 4 km × 4 km |
| Location | High Earth orbit (likely) |

**Scale challenge:**
- Largest terrestrial DCs are ~1 GW (Stargate = 1.2 GW)
- 4km solar panels = unprecedented assembly
- Must launch, deploy, maintain in orbit
- Latency tradeoff (high orbit = seconds delay)

---

## Engineering requirements

| Component | Challenge |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Solar panels** | 4km² — won't fit on any rocket |
| **Radiators** | Massive cooling in vacuum |
| **Shielding** | Cosmic ray protection |
| **Latency** | High orbit = 3+ second delay |

See [[Space data centers]] for technical details.

## Backers and partners

| Investor/Partner | Role |
|------------------|------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Strategic investor, chip supplier |
| **Crusoe** | Cloud infrastructure partner |
| **NFX** | Lead seed investor |
| **[[Y Combinator]]** | Accelerator (W24) |
| Soma Capital | Investor |
| [[a16z]] Scout | Investor |
| Sequoia Scout | Investor |

**Why NVIDIA invested:**
- AI compute demand exceeds Earth's power supply
- [[Space]] DCs = long-term compute expansion
- Hedge against [[Power constraints]]
- NVIDIA chips validated in orbit

## Investment case

**Not investable** — private startup.

**Relevance:**
- Most ambitious single space DC project
- NVIDIA backing = serious intent
- Indicator of industry direction
