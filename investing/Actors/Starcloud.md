**Starcloud** — [[NVIDIA]]-backed startup building 5GW orbital data center. Most ambitious single space DC project.

---

## Why Starcloud matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target capacity | **5 GW** |
| Solar panel size | **4km × 4km** (2.5 miles) |
| Backer | [[NVIDIA]] |
| Status | Early stage |

For comparison: OpenAI's Stargate (Abilene) = 1.2 GW on 4M sq ft.

## The 5GW vision

**Single orbital data center:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Power | 5 GW |
| Solar panels | 4 km × 4 km |
| Location | High Earth orbit (likely) |

**Scale challenge:**
- Largest terrestrial DCs are ~1 GW
- 4km solar panels = unprecedented
- Must launch, deploy, maintain in orbit

---

## Engineering requirements

| Component | Challenge |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Solar panels** | 4km² — won't fit on any rocket |
| **Radiators** | Massive cooling in vacuum |
| **Shielding** | Cosmic ray protection |
| **Latency** | High orbit = 3+ second delay |

See [[Space data centers]] for technical details.

## NVIDIA backing

**Why NVIDIA invested:**
- AI compute demand exceeds Earth's power supply
- Space DCs = long-term compute expansion
- Hedge against [[Power constraints]]
- NVIDIA chips in orbit

---

## Investment case

**Not investable** — private startup.

**Relevance:**
- Most ambitious single space DC project
- NVIDIA backing = serious intent
- Indicator of industry direction
