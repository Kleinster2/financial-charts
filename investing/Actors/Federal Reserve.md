## Current cycle (2022-2026)

| Phase | Dates | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Hiking | Mar 2022 - Jul 2023 | 0% → 5.25-5.50% (525bp) |
| Pause | Jul 2023 - Sep 2024 | Held at 5.25-5.50% |

| **Pause** | Jan 28, 2026 | First hold since July |

**Jan 28-29, 2026 decision:**
- Rates held at 3.50-3.75% — first pause since July
- **10-2 vote:** [[Stephen Miran]] and [[Chris Waller]] dissented for 25bp cut
  - Miran's 4th consecutive dissent (first time at 25bp vs his usual 50bp)
  - Waller's first dissent — may be positioning for Fed Chair nomination
- Removed "downside risks to employment rose" language — labor market stabilizing
- Unemployment 4.4% (Dec), private payrolls +29k/month (low but stable)
- Core PCE at 3.0% (no progress YoY) but mostly tariff-driven goods inflation
- Powell: "If you take tariffs out, core PCE running just a bit above 2%"
- Expects tariff pass-through to peak mid-2026, then fade
- Services disinflation continuing
- Fed hasn't yet complied with DOJ subpoenas (Bill Pulte was instigator)

**Jan 24 rate check:** NY Fed conducted rare "rate check" with currency traders on USD/JPY — reportedly at [[Treasury]]'s request. Markets interpreted this as possible coordinated intervention to weaken dollar. DXY fell 2.26% over 5 days to 4-year low (96.16). See [[US dollar]].

## Chair transition (May 2026)

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Current chair | [[Jerome Powell]] — term ends May 15, 2026 |
| Trump stance | Will not reappoint Powell |
| **Nominee** | **[[Kevin Warsh]]** (Jan 30, 2026) |
| Confirmation | Pending Senate |

### Warsh nomination (Jan 30, 2026)

Trump named former Fed Governor [[Kevin Warsh]] as his pick to replace Powell. Markets fell on the news — S&P -0.43%, Nasdaq -0.94% — as rising Treasury yields reflected expectations of a less dovish Fed.

**Warsh background:**
- Fed Governor 2006-2011 (served through GFC)
- [[Morgan Stanley]] (1995-2002)
- Hoover Institution fellow since 2011
- Perceived as more independent than [[Kevin Hassett]]

### "Battle of the Kevins" (resolved)

| Date | Warsh | Hassett | Event |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| Jan 14 | 39-41% | 40-50% | Neck-and-neck |
| Jan 16 | 60% | 16% | Trump: "I want to keep you where you are" (to Hassett) |
| **Jan 30** | **Nominated** | — | Trump names Warsh |

**Wall Street view:**
> "We don't know who will be the Fed Chairman, nor how dovish a post-Powell Fed will be. However, we think it's a reasonable assumption that an unusually high level of dissent among Fed officials will be a defining feature of next year's Fed." — **Tallbacken Capital**

## Fed independence risk

See [[Fed independence]] for full concept analysis.

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| DOJ investigation | Criminal probe of Powell over building testimony (Jan 2026) |
| Political pressure | Trump wants lower rates |
| Market risk | Diminished credibility → higher long-term rates |
| Gold signal | $4,641/oz record (Jan 14) on independence concerns |

> "The biggest US debt market risk is diminished Fed independence, which could undermine inflation-fighting credibility and the dollar." — **Lazard**

## Balance sheet

| Period | Size | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Pre-COVID | ~$4T | Normal |
| COVID peak | ~$9T | QE (asset purchases) |
| Current | ~$7T | QT (runoff) |
| [[Target]] | ~$6T? | Uncertain endpoint |

**QT pace:** ~$60B/month Treasury runoff, ~$35B/month MBS runoff
