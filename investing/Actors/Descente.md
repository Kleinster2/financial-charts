## Anta Sports China JV

Descente China is operated as a JV between [[Anta Sports]], Descente Ltd, and [[Itochu]]. Anta holds exclusive operating rights for mainland [[China]] — distributing apparel, footwear, and equipment focused on skiing and outdoor.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Anta "other brands" revenue (H1 2025) | RMB 7.4B (+61% YoY) — includes Descente + [[Kolon Sport]] |
| Descente China operating margin | 30%+ (H1 2024) |
| Q1 2025 retail growth | +65-70% YoY (Descente + Kolon) |

Anta's CEO Ding Shizhong has identified Descente as the group's next potential RMB 10B revenue brand. The Descente China business is an equity method affiliate — its revenue does not appear in Descente Ltd's (8114.T) consolidated statements, making the listed entity's financials an incomplete picture of the brand's scale.

## Take-private speculation

[[Itochu]] has been acquiring its subsidiaries (FamilyMart, Itochu Techno-Solutions, Daiken Kogyo). Analysts speculate Descente could be next. Itochu took a hostile stance in 2019, running a tender offer to increase its stake from 30% to 40% and gaining board control.
