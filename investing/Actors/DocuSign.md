## Anthropic Cowork partnership (Feb 24, 2026)

DocuSign's IAM platform available as a connector in [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude Cowork]]. Built on [[MCP]] (Model Context Protocol). DOCU +5.8% on the announcement — part of a broader 10-partnership wave that reversed the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative.

What it does — end-to-end agreement workflows via natural language in Cowork:
- Draft contracts from templates, populate details
- Surface contracts expiring within specified timeframes
- Review and align AI-suggested redlines to company policy
- Generate summary reports with clause filters
- Initiate onboarding workflows with real-time notifications

Security: Enterprise authentication required, permission-based access, agreement data private and under customer control. All within Cowork's trust boundary.

Availability: Beta, global, English only, via Anthropic's Connectors Directory. Requires DocuSign customer status.

[[Allan Thygesen]]: "Docusign and Anthropic are raising the bar for agreement actions. What Docusign brings to agentic experiences like Cowork is deep context across all business agreements — the intelligent workflows that know how to act on that context and the trust, security, and scale enterprises expect."

Matt Piccolella (Anthropic, Product Lead for Enterprise Apps): "Cowork is designed to turn intent into action across complex, multi-step work. Partnering with Docusign brings a leading system of record and execution for contracts into the Cowork experience."

Strategic framing: "Platform-as-component" strategy — DocuSign becomes the agreement execution engine inside AI workflows rather than a standalone product. Strengthens adoption through distribution but raises dependency questions. If AI orchestration becomes the primary interface, DocuSign's brand moat matters less than its data/workflow moat. The bull case: DocuSign's 1.8M customers and deep agreement data become more valuable when AI can act on them. The bear case: DocuSign becomes a replaceable API behind an AI layer.

Q4 FY2026 earnings (Mar 17) will be the first readout on IAM adoption metrics post-partnership.
