## EV strategy

### Evolution

| Date | Target |
|------|--------|
| 2021 | 100% EV by 2030 |
| Sep 2024 | **Backed off** — will offer hybrids "as long as customers need them" |
| 2026 | 7-8% EBIT margin (revised down from >8%) |

### Why the retreat

- Slower EV adoption than expected
- Tariff complexity (considering production relocation)
- Customer demand for hybrids persists

### Current lineup

| Model | Type |
|-------|------|
| EX30 | Compact BEV |
| EX90 | Large BEV SUV |
| XC40 Recharge | Compact BEV |
| C40 Recharge | Crossover BEV |

## Northvolt relationship

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 2021 | Announced 50/50 JV with [[Northvolt]] for battery gigafactory + R&D |
| 2023-24 | JV plans stalled as Northvolt struggled |
| 2024 | **Exited JV** as Northvolt collapsed |

Volvo was an early believer in the European battery champion thesis. The JV failure left Volvo dependent on Asian suppliers.
