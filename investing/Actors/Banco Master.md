## Daniel Vorcaro — the owner

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Born | October 6, 1983, Belo Horizonte |
| Father | Henrique Vorcaro (founder of Multipar real estate group) |
| Education | MBA, Ibmec (2005-2007) |
| Acquired Banco Máxima | 2018 (with Conte brothers) |
| Arrested | November 17, 2025 (Guarulhos Airport, fleeing to Malta via Dubai) |
| Released | November 28, 2025 (11 days), ankle monitor |
| Charges | Fraudulent management, reckless management, criminal organization, money laundering |

### Family background

Vorcaro's father, Henrique Vorcaro, founded Multipar (originally Vorcaro Imóveis, then Centro Sul Empreendimentos) — one of Belo Horizonte's largest real estate development groups. The family built their fortune through decades of urban expansion in Minas Gerais.

Daniel joined his father's companies in 2004 (Multipar, Mercatto, Pacific Realty) before pivoting to finance.

### Career before banking

| Period | Role |
|--------|------|
| 2007-2010 | CFO, SBTEC (tech) |
| 2009-2015 | CFO, Grupo Multipar |
| 2015-2016 | CEO, Grupo Multipar |
| Dec 2015 | Co-founded Zion Capital |
| 2015-2017 | Manager, Maxima Realty |
| 2018 | Acquired Banco Máxima |

### The Conte brothers — original partners

Vorcaro acquired Banco Máxima with the **Conte brothers** (Antonio Augusto and Vicente). After regulatory approval took two years (2017-2019), they rebranded to Banco Master in 2021.

| Brother | Role | Current status |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Antonio Augusto Conte** | Introduced Vorcaro to Faria Lima; first partner | Broke with Vorcaro; alleges fraud from inception; targeted in Jan 2026 raids |
| **Vicente Conte** | Partner | Stayed with Vorcaro; estranged from brother Antonio |

**The break:** Antonio claims FGC alerted him to irregularities, prompting his exit. He now alleges the bank "was born fraudulent." Reports threats, family rupture, and lost friendships after breaking with Vorcaro.

### Business empire

| Asset | Value/Detail |
|-------|--------------|
| **Banco Master** | Net worth grew R$200M → R$4.7B (2019-2024) |
| **Atlético Mineiro SAF** | R$250-300M investment, 26.9% of Galo Holding |
| **Oncoclínicas** | 15% stake, R$1B invested |
| **Fasano Itaim hotel** | Shareholder in property fund |
| **Botanique hotel** | Campos do Jordão boutique hotel |
| **Trancoso mansion** | One of Brazil's most expensive homes (~R$280M) |
| **Veste S.A. (Le Lis, Dudalina)** | 56% via WNT Capital fund |
| **Biomm, Gafisa, Light, Westwing** | Various stakes (distressed plays) |
| **Sozo Real Estate** | Miami real estate company |

### [[Luxury]] lifestyle

| Asset | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Falcon 7X jet** | ~R$200M ($40M), seized; registered to Viking Participações |
| **Gulfstream G700** | Second jet (Viking Participações) |
| **Falcon 2000** | Third jet (Viking Participações) |
| **2023 party** | Daughter's 15th birthday: R$15M, Alok, Dennis DJ, The Chainsmokers |

All three jets purchased 2022-2025, paid in cash (no financing).

### Political connections

**The "trinca" (trio):** Journalist Luís Costa Pinto identified Vorcaro's closest political allies as Ciro Nogueira (PP), Antonio Rueda (União Brasil), and Arthur Lira (PP).

| Individual | Position | Connection |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Ciro Nogueira** | PP president, ex-Bolsonaro Chief of Staff | Brought Vorcaro into Federal District government; proposed "Master amendment" |
| **Arthur Lira** | Former Chamber President (PP) | Considered one of Vorcaro's closest political "friends" |
| **Antonio Rueda** | União Brasil president | Helped negotiate BRB deal |
| **Ibaneis Rocha** | DF Governor (MDB) | Signed law authorizing BRB acquisition |
| **Michel Temer** | Former President (MDB) | Hired as mediator after CB blocked deal |
| **Guido Mantega** | Former Finance Minister (PT) | Consultant; introduced Vorcaro to President Lula |
| **Henrique Meirelles** | Former CB President | On Banco Master advisory committee |

### Hidden partner allegation

Federal Police identified [[Nelson Tanure]] (investor in [[Light SA]], [[PRIO]], distressed companies) as "sócio oculto" (hidden partner) of Master. Tanure denies any ownership.

**Alleged scheme:** CVM report found "coordinated" action between Tanure and Master to inflate Ambipar shares (+700%). Tanure used MAM Asset (Vorcaro's fund manager) for major acquisitions including Copel [[Telecom]] (R$2.5B) and EMAE privatization.

---

## The scheme

### High-yield CDB strategy

| Tactic | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Product | CDBs (Certificates of Deposit) |
| Rates | 140-150%+ of CDI — far above market |
| Distribution | Via investment platforms (apps) |
| Marketing | Highlighted FGC guarantee, buried issuer risk |
| Growth | Rapid deposit gathering |

**The pitch:** High rates, short terms, FGC protection displayed prominently, actual issuer in small print. Retail investors saw the rate and the app logo, not the structural risk.

### Classic Ponzi dynamics

```
Offer above-market CDB rates
    → Attract retail deposits via apps
        → Use deposits for... what?
            → Allegedly fraudulent credit securities
                → Liquidity crisis when music stops
                    → FGC (and taxpayers) absorb losses
```

---

## The Reag connection

**[[Reag Investimentos]]** — the asset manager that laundered Master's fictitious loans.

### How the laundering worked

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| 1. Originate | Master issues fictitious loans to 36 shell companies |
| 2. Invest | [[Shell]] companies "invest" proceeds in Reag funds |
| 3. Inflate | Reag marks up assets (Besc cártulas) to fabricated valuations |
| 4. Extract | Profits extracted through fund redemptions |

### Scale of the fraud

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total diverted | R$11.5B ($2.1B) |
| Forged instruments | Up to R$17B ($3.15B) |
| [[Shell]] companies | 36 (avg loan R$288M each) |
| Reag funds implicated | 8 |

### The BESC cártulas — worthless "assets"

The Reag funds bought **cártulas** (physical share certificates) from the defunct **Banco do Estado de Santa Catarina (BESC)** — a state bank absorbed by Banco do Brasil in 2008 for R$685M.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BESC absorbed | September 2008 |
| Cártulas real value | ~Zero (no liquidity, bank extinct) |
| Purchase price | R$850M |
| Marked-up valuation | R$10.8B |

**Why they're worthless:** BESC shares have no liquidity — the bank doesn't exist. Courts have ruled them unsuitable even as collateral. Yet Reag funds valued them at R$10.8B.

**Investigator quote:** These cártulas "are worth nothing" and "could not be priced in the manner they were."

The cártulas circulated between different Reag funds on the same day — investigators called it a "grosseira" (crude) fraud based on simulated transactions.

### The High Tower Fund — smoking gun

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase price (Besc cártulas) | R$850M |
| Marked-up valuation | R$10.8B |
| Reported 2024 return | **10,502,205.65%** |

A 10.5 million percent return is the clearest evidence of accounting fraud.

### Key figures

| Individual | Role |
|------------|------|
| **João Carlos Mansur** | Reag founder, targeted in Jan 2026 raids (not in Brazil) |
| **Nelson Tanure** | Hidden partner allegation; targeted in same raids |

**Reag liquidated:** January 15, 2026 — one day after second phase of Operation Compliance Zero.

---

## The BRB connection

**BRB (Banco de Brasília)** — state-owned bank of the Federal District.

| Event | Date | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| BRB injects capital | 2024-2025 | R$16.7B total into Banco Master |
| Acquisition announced | March 2025 | BRB to acquire 58% of Master (R$23B in assets) |
| Central Bank blocks | September 2025 | Cited "excessive risks," lack of viability proof |
| Liquidation | November 2025 | Central Bank shuts Master |

**The allegation:** BRB acquired credit portfolios from Banco Master through "underhanded procedures" and "pure camaraderie" — R$12.2B in unsecured transactions to stave off Master's liquidity crisis.

**BRB fallout:**

| Individual | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **Paulo Henrique Costa** | President — suspended 60 days by court order; replaced by Nelson de Souza |
| **Dario Oswaldo Garcia Junior** | Financial director — removed |

**New management:** BRB contracted external audit. Testimony collected from Vorcaro, Costa, and CB Director of Supervision Ailton de Aquino.

### The Tirreno scheme — fictitious credits

**Tirreno Consultoria Promotoria de Crédito e Participações S.A.** — shell company at the center of the BRB fraud channel.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fictitious credits "originated" | R$6.7B |
| Credit type | Payroll-deductible loans (that didn't exist) |
| Originator | Financial institution Cartos |
| Transferred to | BRB |

**How it worked:**
1. Tirreno "originated" R$6.7B in payroll-deductible credits (non-existent)
2. Banco Master recorded them as real assets
3. Master sold these fake credits to BRB
4. The R$6.7B "owed" to Tirreno was never actually transferred — it sat in a linked deposit account within Master, with no movement through the financial system

**Investigator description:** "Vertical integration of fraud" — Tirreno was a "casca" (shell).

**BRB executives knew?** Federal Judge Ricardo Augusto Leite: "There is emerging evidence that BRB executives knowingly took part in the alleged fraudulent scheme."

---

## Supreme Court controversy

The scandal engulfed Brazil's highest court — four sitting justices, two former justices, the Attorney General, and the Advocate General all attended Vorcaro-sponsored events.

### Justices involved

| Justice | Involvement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dias Toffoli** | Case rapporteur (assigned 11 days after Vorcaro's arrest); traveled to Libertadores final (Lima) on private jet with Vorcaro's defense lawyer; imposed maximum secrecy on case |
| **Alexandre de Moraes** | Wife's R$129M contract; contacted CB president Galípolo 6+ times (5 in one day) during investigation |
| **Gilmar Mendes** | Pending Master tax appeal (CSLL) in his office; attended sponsored events |
| **Luiz Fux** | Attended Brazil Conference at Cambridge (Master was [[Platinum]] sponsor) |
| **Luís Roberto Barroso** | Former STF president; attended 2024 Rome forum (Master sponsor) |
| **Ricardo Lewandowski** | Former justice, now Justice Minister; attended sponsored events |
| **Paulo Gonet** | Attorney General; attended sponsored events |
| **Jorge Messias** | Advocate General (nominated to STF); attended sponsored events |

### Sponsored events (2022-2025)

Banco Master sponsored forums in New York, London, Paris, Rome, and Cambridge (USA) where these officials participated. Notable:

- **2022 Fasano dinner (NYC):** Vorcaro and Master paid for dinner for Gilmar Mendes, Moraes, Barroso, and Lewandowski at Fasano New York (5th Avenue)
- **Oct 2024 Rome forum:** 2nd Esfera International Forum; Barroso (then STF president) and Toffoli attended; Master was sponsor

### The Moraes wife contract

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Firm | Barci de Moraes Advogados |
| Contract holder | Viviane Barci de Moraes (wife of Justice Moraes) |
| Monthly payment | R$3.6 million |
| Contract term | 3 years (Jan 2024 - Jan 2027) |
| Total value | R$129 million ($24M) |
| Paid before liquidation | ~R$79 million (through Oct 2025) |

**Scope of work:** Contract stipulated firm would defend Banco Master and Daniel Vorcaro before:
- Central Bank
- Federal Revenue Service
- National Congress
- Judiciary, prosecutors, Federal Police
- CADE (antitrust)

**The conflict:** While Moraes's wife's firm was paid R$79M to lobby regulators including Central Bank, Moraes personally contacted CB president Galípolo at least 6 times during the bank's investigation.

**Moraes's explanation:** Said calls to Galípolo were about US Magnitsky sanctions affecting him and his wife — not Banco Master. Denies any calls about the bank. Says wife's firm never acted on BRB acquisition before regulators.

**Political fallout:**
- Senator Alessandro Vieira seeking CPI (parliamentary inquiry) into Moraes family/Banco Master
- Moraes opened investigation into possible leak of his own tax data

**Timing:** Contract signed January 2024, would have run through early 2027 — when Moraes is scheduled to become Supreme Court president.

## FGC payout — largest ever

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Eligible depositors | 1.6 million |
| Total covered | R$41B ($7.6B) |
| Coverage limit | R$250,000 per person per institution |
| FGC reserves (Sept 2025) | ~R$120B |
| Payout as % of reserves | ~34% |

**Who pays:** FGC is funded by banks (private sector), not taxpayers directly. But a crisis starting with a state bank (BRB) and a connected banker is cleaned up with industry money.

**Payouts began:** January 13, 2026.

### Public pension fund losses (NOT covered by FGC)

**Total exposure:** R$1.8-1.9B across 18+ state/municipal pension funds.

| Fund | Exposure | Political connection |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Rioprevidência** (Rio state) | R$970M - R$2.6B (disputed) | — |
| **Amprev** (Amapá state) | R$400M | Linked to Senator Davi Alcolumbre (União Brasil) |
| **Maceió Previdência** | R$97M | Mayor tied to Arthur Lira |
| **São Roque** | R$93M | — |
| **Cajamar** | R$87M | — |
| **Itaguaí** | R$60M | — |

Financial letters (letras financeiras) aren't covered by FGC. Ministry of Social Security confirmed: states/municipalities are "final guarantor" — they must cover any shortfall in pension payments.

**Rio's exposure:** TCE-RJ (Court of Auditors) reported R$2.6B exposure; Rioprevidência claims R$970M. Rio currently lacks valid CRP (Certificate of Social Security Regularity).

---

## US Chapter 15 — international freeze

On January 8, 2026, US Bankruptcy Court (Chief Judge Scott M. Grossman) recognized Brazil's liquidation as the main proceeding under **Chapter 15** — America's cross-border insolvency system.

| Effect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Asset freeze | All US-located Banco Master assets frozen |
| Creditor bar | No US lawsuits or enforcement during liquidation |
| Liquidator powers | Brazilian liquidator (EFB Regimes Especiais) can use US discovery, subpoena documents, trace assets |

**Vorcaro's failed defense:** Argued US court should wait because TCU might reverse liquidation. Judge rejected — TCU cannot overrule Central Bank.

---

## TCU vs Central Bank — institutional battle

Brazil's audit court (TCU) briefly threatened to challenge the liquidation, creating market panic and concerns about Central Bank autonomy.

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 5, 2026 | Minister Jhonatan de Jesus orders probe into CB procedures |
| Jan 7, 2026 | TCU President Vital do Rêgo: only Supreme Court can reverse liquidation |
| Jan 12, 2026 | CB-TCU meeting; CB accepts inspection |
| Jan 13, 2026 | CB withdraws appeal; agreement reached |

**Resolution:** TCU will inspect CB's procedures (30-day audit by AudBancos team) but **will not challenge the liquidation itself**. Inspection respects banking secrecy and CB's constitutional authority.

**Why it mattered:** Markets feared TCU could create precedent undermining CB independence. Resolution preserved institutional boundaries.

---

## Why it matters

**Most recent Brazilian [[Bank cronyism]] case.** Shows the pattern persists:

| Element | Banco Master | Classic pattern |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Aggressive growth | 140%+ CDI rates | High rates to attract deposits |
| Political connections | Brasília network, BRB | License/protection via connections |
| State bank involvement | BRB injected R$16.7B | State resources flow to connected party |
| Regulatory failure | CB blocked late | Delayed intervention |
| Judicial entanglement | STF justices involved | Political protection |
| Socialized losses | R$41B FGC payout | Public/industry absorbs cost |
| Owner extraction | Fled to Malta, arrested | Tried to escape with gains |

**International implications:** IMF and World Bank raised concerns during Brazil FSAP assessment. Politicization of liquidation process damages institutional credibility.

---

## Comparison to prior Brazilian cases

| Bank | Year | Hole | Pattern |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Banco Master** | 2025 | R$41B | High-yield CDBs, political connections, state bank bailout attempt |
| Cruzeiro do Sul | 2012 | R$1.3B | Payroll lending fraud |
| Panamericano | 2010 | R$4.3B | Accounting fraud, media mogul owner, rescued |
| Banco Santos | 2004 | — | Fraud, political loans, liquidated |

**Banco Master is the largest** — R$41B FGC payout dwarfs prior cases.

---

## Comparison to [[Ayandeh Bank]] ([[Iran]] 2025)

Two [[Bank cronyism]] collapses one month apart — one democratic, one authoritarian. Both linked to ~40-45 year old political structures.

| | Banco Master | Ayandeh Bank |
|--|--------------|--------------|
| **Collapsed** | November 2025 | October 2025 |
| **Deposits** | $7.6B (R$41B) | $2.34B |
| **Political structure** | Nova República (1985) — 40 years | Islamic Revolution (1979) — 46 years |
| **Owner outcome** | Arrested fleeing | Protected in [[Iran]] |
| **Who pays** | FGC (banks) | Depositors (inflation) |

**Key insight:** Same pattern, different outcomes. Both Vorcaro and Ansari were outsiders who learned to plug into mature political networks. The structures taught them what was possible.

See [[Ayandeh-Master comparison]] for full analysis.
