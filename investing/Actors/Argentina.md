## Milei's tech positioning

| Action | [[Signal]] |
|--------|--------|
| Met with OpenAI delegation | Personal involvement |
| RIGI program launch | Structural incentives |
| Pro-US alignment | Geopolitical positioning |
| Deregulation push | Faster permitting |

Milei views AI infrastructure as economic transformation lever.

## Energy advantage

Patagonia offers:

| Resource | Advantage |
|----------|-----------|
| Wind | Some of world's best wind resources |
| Hydro | Existing hydroelectric capacity |
| Solar | Northern regions |
| Cost | Below US/[[EU]] electricity prices |
| Grid | Less congested than US markets |

**The pitch**: Cheap, clean power for compute-intensive AI workloads.

## vs Other [[LATAM]]

| Country | Data center status |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Argentina** | Stargate ($25B, 500MW) — largest |
| [[Brazil]] | Existing hyperscaler presence |
| [[Chile]] | Growing, good connectivity |
| [[Mexico]] | Nearshoring beneficiary |

Argentina leap-frogging with single mega-project.

## Labor reform (Feb 2026)

Milei passed a major labor flexibilization reform — causing strikes and protests but aimed at formalizing the **50%+ informal workforce**:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Working hours | Up to 12hrs/day (40hrs/week maintained) |
| Vacations | Split into 4 periods of 7 days |
| Commuting accidents | Reduced employer liability |
| Overtime | Time off compensation instead of pay |

**Investment relevance:** Formalization = more tax revenue + larger consumer credit market + better economic data. Similar to [[Brazil]]'s 2017 Temer reform, which took years to show results but contributed to current low unemployment. Short-term disruption (strikes, political backlash) but long-term structural positive if sustained.

**The 5-10 year view:** Argentina's reforms parallel Brazil's Plano Real trajectory — FHC stabilized the currency but it took until Lula's government (8-10 years later) for real stability. Milei's reforms will face similar timeline.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity |
|------|----------|
| Political instability | Medium — Milei polarizing |
| Currency volatility | High — peso history |
| Execution | Medium — infrastructure gaps |
| Grid reliability | Medium — upgrades needed |
| Regulatory change | Low — RIGI has 30-year lock |

RIGI's 30-year stability clause designed to mitigate political risk.
