**Microsoft (Azure)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, OpenAI partner, largest enterprise cloud.

---

## Relevance to semis

Microsoft is the largest AI infrastructure spender. OpenAI partnership makes them critical demand driver for NVIDIA GPUs.

---

## Chip strategy

- Massive [[NVIDIA]] buyer (OpenAI infrastructure)
- **Maia**: Custom AI accelerator (announced 2023)
- **Cobalt**: ARM-based CPU
- Designed in-house, fabbed at [[TSMC]]

---

## OpenAI relationship

**Partnership restructured (Oct 2024):**
- Was: Exclusive cloud provider, deeply intertwined
- Now: Losing exclusivity early 2030s
- Microsoft building own AI capabilities separately

OpenAI's compute needs still flow through Microsoft Azure → NVIDIA → TSMC. But Microsoft is hedging.
