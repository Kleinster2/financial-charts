## Chip strategy

- Massive [[NVIDIA]] buyer (OpenAI infrastructure)
- **Maia 200**: 2nd-gen AI inference chip, launched Jan 28, 2026 — [[TSMC]] 3nm process
- **Maia 100**: First-gen custom AI accelerator (announced 2023)
- **Cobalt**: ARM-based CPU
- Designed in-house, fabbed at [[TSMC]]

---

## OpenAI relationship

**Partnership restructured (Oct 2025):**
- Was: Exclusive cloud provider, 49% profit share (capped)
- Now: **27% equity stake**, losing exclusivity by 2032
- Microsoft building own AI capabilities separately

OpenAI's compute needs still flow through Microsoft Azure → NVIDIA → TSMC. But Microsoft is hedging.

## OpenAI investment analysis (Jan 2026)

**Reverse-engineering OpenAI valuation from MSFT Q2 FY2026 earnings:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MSFT total invested | $13.8B |
| MSFT stake (post-restructuring) | **27%** |
| MSFT stake value | **$135B** |
| Implied OpenAI valuation | **$500B** |
| MSFT return | **~10x** |
| Q2 FY2026 gain (mark-to-market) | $7.6B |

**Why only $7.6B this quarter?**

The $7.6B is the *incremental* adjustment from the Oct 2025 restructuring, not total gains. Pre-restructuring, MSFT carried OpenAI at ~$127B ($135B - $7.6B). The restructuring to a Public Benefit Corporation with clear equity percentages triggered the revaluation.

**Key terms (Oct 2025 restructuring):**
- OpenAI contracted $250B of Azure services
- MSFT lost right of first refusal on compute
- MSFT can now pursue AGI independently
- IP access extended through 2032

**Prior stake:** Before recent funding rounds, MSFT held 32.5% (diluted to 27% by new capital).

## Q2 FY2026 earnings (Jan 28, 2026)

**Beat estimates, but stock -10% on slowing Azure growth**

| Metric | Q2 FY26 | vs Est | YoY |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Revenue | $81.27B | Beat ($80.27B) | +17% |
| EPS (adj) | $4.14 | Beat ($3.97) | — |
| Net income | $38.46B | — | +60% |
| Azure growth | **39%** | — | Decel from 40% Q1 |
| Gross margin | **68%** | — | 3-year low |

**Segment breakdown:**

| Segment | Revenue | YoY |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Intelligent Cloud | $32.9B | +29% |
| Productivity & Business | $34.1B | +13% |
| More Personal Computing | $14.3B | -3% |

Xbox content/services -5%. Microsoft 365 Copilot reached 15M commercial seats.

**Key concerns:**
- Azure deceleration (39% vs 40% Q1) spooked investors
- Gross margin at 3-year low from AI infrastructure costs
- Stock down 11% past 3 months on capex concerns

**Positives:**
- OpenAI investment gains: **$7.6B**
- Revenue/EPS both beat consensus
- AI infrastructure buildout on track

**Forward guidance (Q3 FY26):**
- Revenue: $80.65-81.75B (mid $81.2B meets consensus)
- Azure growth: 37-38% constant currency (consensus 37.1%)
- Commercial RPO: $625B (+110% YoY), 45% tied to OpenAI's $250B cloud commitment

## Azure model-agnostic strategy

Unlike Google ([[Gemini]]-focused), Azure positioned as neutral AI facilitator:

| Model | Provider | Available on Azure |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 / [[ChatGPT]] | [[OpenAI]] | ✓ (primary) |
| [[Claude]] | [[Anthropic]] | ✓ |
| [[Grok]] | [[xAI]] | ✓ |
| [[Llama]] | [[Meta]] | ✓ |
| [[DeepSeek]] R1 | [[DeepSeek]] | ✓ |

**Result:** Azure grew **39%** in Q2 FY26 (ended Dec 31), down from 40% in Q1.

**Strategic logic:**
- Customers pick best model for use case
- Microsoft wins regardless of which model dominates
- Reduces OpenAI dependency risk
- Attracts customers wary of vendor lock-in

## AI leadership overhaul (Jan 2026)

Nadella in "founder mode" — weekly cross-team AI meetings, hands-on product focus.

**Key appointments:**

| Role | Person | Background |
|------|--------|------------|
| CoreAI (developer tools) | Jay Parikh | Ex-Meta engineering head (left 2021) |
| Microsoft AI (models) | Mustafa Suleyman | DeepMind co-founder |
| Corporate strategy | Kathleen Hogan | Ex-HR chief |
| AI economics advisor | Rolf Harms | Long-standing MS strategist |
| Office suite + LinkedIn | Ryan Roslansky | LinkedIn CEO |

**Suleyman's unit:** Independent budget, own pay scale to compete for AI talent. Internal jealousy noted.

**Succession signals:**
- 16 direct reports to Nadella
- Young talent elevated: Asha Sharma (37), Charles Lamanna (37) leading AI product categories
- Nadella is 58, same age Ballmer left — expected to stay several more years

## Competitive position (Jan 2026)

**AI coding tools market share (CB Insights):**

| Product | Share |
|---------|-------|
| GitHub Copilot | 24.9% |
| [[Anthropic]] [[Claude]] | 24% |
| [[Cursor]] | 24% |

Startups (Anthropic, [[Anysphere]]/[[Cursor]], Replit) eating into Microsoft's coding tool share.

**Microsoft 365 Copilot:**
- 150M MAU
- Behind [[ChatGPT]] (800M) and [[Gemini]] (650M)
- Monetization challenge vs free competitors

**Startup engagement:**
- Meeting with Applied Compute ([[AI agents]], ex-OpenAI founders)
- Meeting with Mercor (AI hiring platform)

## Fairwater AI campus design

**Specialized DC architecture (per SemiAnalysis satellite analysis):**

| Building Type | Stories | Power | Cooling | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| **GPU Building** | 2 | 300MW | Liquid | Ultra-dense GPU clusters |
| **CPU/Storage Building** | 1 | 48MW | Air | Storage, control plane, RL environments |

**Design rationale:**
- GPUs must be physically close for **network coherence** — drives ultra-dense 2-story design
- CPU-based RL environments don't strictly need same availability zone
- Co-location improves developer productivity

**Implication:** Purpose-built AI DCs are fundamentally different from legacy facilities. Validates [[GPU deployment bottleneck]] — can't just retrofit existing DCs for Blackwell-class workloads.

See [[AI datacenter architecture]] for full design patterns.

## TCJA repatriation (2018)
