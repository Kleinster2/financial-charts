## Why Greg Yang matters

Rare combination: world-class mathematician + AI company co-founder. His theoretical work explains *why* large neural networks work and *how* to scale them optimally.

## Tensor Programs

**The theoretical foundation for scaling neural networks:**

| Concept | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Hyperparameter transfer | Tune small model → transfer settings to large model |
| Used for | GPT-3 tuning, other frontier models |
| Goal | "Theory of Everything" for large-scale deep learning |

**Why this matters:** Training large models is expensive. If you can tune hyperparameters on a small model and transfer them reliably, you save millions in compute. Yang's work made this mathematically rigorous.

## xAI role

**Original 12 founding members.** Recruited talent directly — Ghori noted Yang personally reached out to engineers, was "great at recruiting."

Research focus at xAI:
- "Math for AI" — theoretical foundations
- "AI for Math" — using AI for mathematical discovery
- Safety/alignment through mathematical understanding

## Departure (Jan 2026)

Left xAI on Jan 21, 2026 — one day after Sulaiman Ghori's departure. Cited Lyme disease diagnosis.

Per Bloomberg: Health reasons, but timing notable given Ghori podcast controversy and [[Anthropic]] cutting xAI's Claude access that month.
