## Berbera Port (Somaliland) — Risk Exposure

DP World holds a **65% stake** ($442M, 30-year concession) in Berbera port, Somaliland. This has become a geopolitical flashpoint:

- **January 2026**: Somalia cancelled **all agreements with the UAE**, including defense/security cooperation and UAE operational control over Somali ports, after Israel recognized Somaliland (December 2025) and the UAE appeared to facilitate Israeli access
- Somalia banned UAE military and cargo planes from its airspace (January 8, 2026)
- Berbera sits on the Gulf of Aden, strategically positioned across from Yemen — Israel seeking Red Sea military access there
- Ethiopia's Somaliland port MOU (2024, paused) also targeted Berbera area
- Somaliland's de facto independence protects DP World's concession from Mogadishu's cancellation orders, but the legal and political uncertainty is elevated

**Risk**: If Horn of Africa conflict escalates (Ethiopia-Eritrea war risk, Houthi threats to Somaliland per Houthi leader al-Houthi), Berbera operations could be disrupted. Al-Shabaab has also threatened any Israeli presence in Somaliland, referencing its 2008 Hargeisa bombings.

## Investment Angle

**Bull case:**
- Strong margin (27% EBITDA)
- Geographic diversification
- Dubai hub position
- Aggressive capex for growth

**Bear case:**
- Limited liquidity (80% state-owned)
- Geopolitical exposure (Middle East + Horn of Africa)
- Berbera concession caught in UAE-Somalia diplomatic rupture
- Competition from [[SIPG]], [[PSA International]]
