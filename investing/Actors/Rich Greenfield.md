## Key theses & calls

### Cord-cutting (2008-present) — correct
One of the earliest analysts to call the secular decline of pay-TV subscribers, correlating cord-cutting with broadband penetration as early as 2008-2012. The trend has only accelerated — ~39.3M cumulative cord-cutters and counting. His thesis that legacy media companies were too slow to adapt has been validated by the collapse of cable bundle economics and the restructurings now reshaping the industry ([[Comcast]] spinning off [[Versant]], [[Warner Bros Discovery]] breakup discussions).

### Netflix bull — correct
Consistently bullish on [[Netflix]] from his BTIG days through [[LightShed Partners]]. NFLX has massively outperformed, +45% in 2025 alone.

### [[Reddit]] initiation (Aug 2024) — correct
Initiated Buy with $84 PT on August 5, 2024. Stock returned +250% over the following year — his most profitable tracked call. Argues Reddit's human-generated data makes it increasingly valuable to LLMs and AI search.

### AMC $0.01 PT (March 2021) — controversial
Initiated [[AMC Entertainment]] at Sell with a one-penny target, arguing unsustainable debt and no free cash flow. Fundamentally defensible but spectacularly wrong in market terms as AMC surged to $72 in the meme stock rally. Made him a lightning rod for retail investor hostility — received death threats, had to involve police, temporarily went private on X.

### [[Disney]] — mixed
Downgraded to Sell in May 2020. Later admitted error and upgraded to Neutral, acknowledging Disney's streaming pivot was more successful than expected.

## Recent takes (2025-2026)

- [[Warner Bros Discovery]] saga (Feb 2026): His #1 prediction for 2026 was that [[Paramount Global]] would abandon its hostile bid for WBD and that WBD would complete its Discovery Global spinoff. Called Discovery Global post-spinout an interesting acquisition target for [[Paramount Global]]
- [[Versant]] debut (Jan 2026): Predicted subscriber declines would accelerate in 2026; warned that buying more cable networks for scale is a failing strategy
- [[Streaming]] bundling (Oct 2025): Noted the DTC world is harder than media companies expected, with bundling dynamics returning
- [[Spotify]] AI: Has been probing management on AI-driven music experiences, superfan pricing tiers, and targeting

## Style & reputation

Fast Company profiled him in 2018 as the analyst who stirs "Media Twitter." His value is in directional, thematic calls — cord-cutting, streaming winners/losers, media consolidation — rather than precise price targets. He polarizes: media executives and meme stock investors tend to dislike him, while institutional investors value the independent, contrarian perspective. Critics note a persistent bearish tilt on legacy media. LightShed's annual "Top 20 TMT Predictions" is a widely followed product.
