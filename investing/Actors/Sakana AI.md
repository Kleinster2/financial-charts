# Sakana AI

Tokyo-based AI research lab focused on nature-inspired, efficient AI models optimized for Japanese language and culture.

## Overview

Founded 2023 by former Google researchers. Philosophy centers on evolutionary/collective intelligence approaches rather than brute-force compute scaling. Japan's most valuable private startup as of Nov 2025.

**Headquarters:** Tokyo, Japan

## Founders

| Name | Role | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| David Ha | CEO | Former Google Brain research scientist, ex-Goldman Sachs derivatives trader |
| Llion Jones | CTO | Co-author of "Attention Is All You Need" (2017 Transformer paper) |
| Ren Ito | COO | Former Japan foreign ministry |

## Products & Research

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| AI Scientist | Automated scientific discovery system (hypothesis → experiment → peer review) |
| Evolutionary Model Merge | Combines open-source models using evolutionary computation |
| Continuous Thought Machine | Leverages neuron synchronization for temporal reasoning |
| Transformer² | Self-adaptive LLM that dynamically adjusts weights per task |
| AB-MCTS | Algorithm enabling multiple frontier models to cooperate at inference |
| Darwin Godel Machine | Frontier AI research system |

## Strategic Notes

- Japan's first AI unicorn and most valuable private startup
- In-Q-Tel investment signals US intelligence community interest
- Heavy backing from Japanese financial institutions (MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho) and corporates
- Differentiated approach: nature-inspired efficiency vs compute-heavy Western labs
- Japan-optimized models could capture domestic enterprise market
