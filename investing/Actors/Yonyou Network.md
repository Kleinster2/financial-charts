## Cloud transition

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cloud revenue share | ~77% (Q2 2024) |
| Cloud customer growth (2022-2024) | +31.5% cumulative |
| Cloud customer growth (H1 2024→H1 2025) | +4.7% (decelerating) |
| Cumulative paying cloud customers | 872,500 |
| ARR as % of cloud revenue | 32% |
| Large enterprise subscription growth | +26% (2024) |
| Medium enterprise subscription growth | +66% (2024) |

Critical weakness: ARR is only 32% of cloud revenue (vs [[Kingdee International]] at 58%). Most cloud revenue is project-based/one-time, not recurring — a structural quality problem.

## Market position

- #1 in China enterprise software & services market by revenue (4.1% share, Frost & Sullivan)
- #1 in China aPaaS market (IDC)
- #1 in ultra-large SaaS applications in China (IDC)
- Top 10 globally in aPaaS (Gartner)
- Market is fragmented — #1 at 4.1% means a very long tail of vendors

Competitors:

| Competitor | Strength | vs Yonyou |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| [[Kingdee International]] | SME cloud (58% ARR) | Higher quality cloud revenue |
| [[SAP]] | High-end/multinational | ~40% China ERP historically with Oracle |
| [[Oracle]] | Large enterprise | Legacy displacement target |
| [[Microsoft]] | Dynamics 365 | Growing in China |

---

## Government / SOE focus

- 27 Tier 1 Central Enterprises signed (China State Shipbuilding, China Electronics, [[China Unicom]])
- 33,000+ large and medium enterprises on YonBIP
- SOEs are dominant component of large enterprise revenue (64% of total)
- [[Xinchuang]] (信创) mandate pushing SOEs to replace [[SAP]]/[[Oracle]] with domestic alternatives — structural tailwind

---

## AI integration

- YonGPT 2.0 — proprietary enterprise AI model. 100+ intelligent applications across finance, HR, supply chain
- [[DeepSeek]] integration — V3 and R1 models integrated into BIP platform (2025). Enterprise customers access via public and private cloud
- Yonyou BIP 5 — released Aug 2025 at GBIC Shenzhen. Native AI x Data x Process integration. Transforms enterprise software from "tool system" to "business partner"

## HK dual listing

Filed for HKEX Main Board listing June 2025, re-filed December 2025. Joint sponsors: CMB International, CITIC Securities. Likely motivated by cash needs given mounting losses.

## Leadership churn

Three presidents in two years — a warning signal:

| Period | President | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Pre-Jan 2024 | Wang Wenjing (founder) | Stepped back, retained chairman/CEO |
| Jan 2024–Jan 2025 | Chen Qiangbin (internal) | Resigned under loss pressure |
| Jan–Mar 2025 | Huang Chenhong (ex-SAP Global EVP) | Left after 3 months. Became CEO of SuperX AI (SUPX, NASDAQ) |

Wang Wenjing (founder, age ~61, net worth ~$3.1B per Forbes) remains chairman and CEO.

## Investment case

Bull:
- #1 in China enterprise software — structural position
- Xinchuang mandate creating captive SOE demand
- Cloud at 77% of revenue — transition well advanced
- AI integration (YonGPT, DeepSeek) could drive new monetization
- HK listing could provide capital for turnaround
- China enterprise software penetration still low vs US

Bear:
- Losses accelerating (-RMB 2.06B in 2024, worse than 2023)
- ARR only 32% of cloud revenue — quality problem
- Cloud customer growth decelerating (31.5% → 4.7%)
- Revenue declining (-6.6% in 2024)
- Leadership instability — three presidents in two years
- [[Kingdee International]] executing cloud transition more effectively
- Gross margins compressing (60% → 47%)
