## Top 10 Holdings

| [[NVIDIA]] | 9.0% |
| [[Apple]] | 8.0% |
| [[Microsoft]] | 7.2% |
| [[Amazon]] | 4.9% |
| [[Tesla]] | 4.0% |
| [[Meta]] | 3.9% |
| [[Alphabet]] (GOOGL) | 3.6% |

| [[Broadcom]] | 3.3% |
| [[Palantir]] | 2.2% |

Mag 7 + Broadcom + Palantir = ~50% of the fund. It's a concentrated bet on tech mega-caps.

## What It Is (and Isn't)

**Tracks Nasdaq 100** — the 100 largest non-financial companies on Nasdaq. Despite the name, it's not "all tech":
- Includes [[Costco]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Starbucks]]
- Excludes financials entirely
- Market-cap weighted (mega-caps dominate)

**Not the Nasdaq Composite** — that's 3,000+ stocks. QQQ is just the top 100.

## Use Case

Broad tech/growth benchmark. When analyzing:
- **Individual tech stocks** — compare vs QQQ
- **Growth vs value** — QQQ vs [[SPY]] spread
- **Tech sector performance** — QQQ captures the big names

For pure semiconductor exposure, use [[SMH]] or [[SOXX]] instead.
