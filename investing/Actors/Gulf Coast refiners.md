**Gulf Coast refiners** — Cluster of US refineries in Texas/Louisiana configured for heavy sour crude. Primary US beneficiary of Venezuela oil return.

---

## Why Gulf Coast refiners matter

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Heavy crude capacity | Built for Venezuela, [[Mexico]], [[Canada]] crude |
| Scale | ~9M bpd capacity (half of US total) |
| Geography | Closest US refineries to Venezuela |
| Infrastructure | Pipelines, ports, storage optimized |

## The heavy crude advantage

**Gulf Coast refineries were built for Venezuelan crude:**

```
1990s-2000s: Venezuela → Gulf Coast (natural fit)
2007-2019:   Venezuela collapse → [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] substitute
2019-2022:   US sanctions → [[China]] gets Venezuela crude
2022+:       Chevron license → some return
2026:        Maduro capture → full return possible
```

**Why it matters:** Light sweet crude (WTI, Brent) trades at premium. Complex refineries profit by processing discounted heavy crude.

## Major players

| Company | Gulf Coast capacity | Venezuela leverage |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [[Valero]] | ~2M bpd | Highest |
| [[Exxon]] | ~1.5M bpd (Beaumont, Baytown) | High |
| [[Chevron]] | ~0.9M bpd (Pascagoula) | High (operator) |
| [[Phillips 66]] | ~0.7M bpd (Sweeny, Alliance) | Moderate |
| [[PBF Energy]] | ~0.2M bpd (Chalmette) | High (pure-play) |
| [[Marathon Petroleum]] | ~1.2M bpd (Galveston Bay, Garyville) | High |
| [[Citgo]] | ~0.8M bpd (Lake Charles, Corpus Christi, Lemont) | Complicated ([[PDVSA]]-owned, embattled) |

## PADD 3

**Petroleum Administration for [[Defense]] District 3:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Region | Texas, Louisiana, New [[Mexico]], Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama |
| Capacity | ~9.5M bpd |
| Share of US | ~50% |
| Utilization | ~90%+ |

Gulf Coast = America's refining heartland.

## Crude sources

| Source | Type | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Venezuela | Heavy sour | Returning (post-Maduro) |
| [[Canada]] (oil sands) | Heavy sour | Pipeline constrained |
| [[Mexico]] (Maya) | Heavy sour | Declining exports |
| Permian | Light sweet | Abundant but less profitable for complex refiners |
| Middle East | Varies | Long shipping distance |

**Venezuela advantage:** Closest heavy crude source to Gulf Coast.

## Venezuela impact

**Pre-collapse (1990s):**
- Venezuela supplied ~1.5M bpd to US
- Gulf Coast refineries optimized for it
- Citgo ([[PDVSA]]-owned) integrated

**Post-collapse:**
- Replaced with Canadian, Mexican crude
- Higher transport costs
- Lost optimization

**Post-[[Maduro capture 2026]]:**
- If production rebuilt: Gulf Coast first in line
- Trump prioritizing US companies
- [[Chevron]] already positioned
- Refiners get cheaper, closer feedstock

## Investment thesis

**[[Venezuela oil rebuild]] beneficiaries:**

| Company | Why |
|---------|-----|
| [[Valero]] | Largest independent, most Gulf Coast exposure |
| [[PBF Energy]] | Pure-play, highest beta |
| [[Marathon Petroleum]] | Largest overall, major Gulf Coast presence |
| [[Phillips 66]] | Diversified but exposed |

**Catalyst:** Venezuela production ramp → margin expansion for complex refiners.

---

## Citgo complication

**[[PDVSA]] owns Citgo:**

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ownership | Venezuelan state ([[PDVSA]]) |
| Assets | 3 US refineries, pipelines, retail |
| Legal claims | [[ConocoPhillips]], bondholders seeking to seize |
| Post-Maduro | Ownership transfer likely |

Citgo is the Venezuelan asset *in* the US — could be privatized or seized by creditors.
