## Why Kuo matters

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Accuracy | 73-81% depending on tracker (AppleTrack, AppleScoop) |

| Supply chain access | Deep contacts in Apple's Asian manufacturing network |

## Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Firm | TF International Securities |
| Focus | Apple hardware, supply chain |
| Prior firms | KGI Securities, Concord Securities, DigiTimes |
| Media presence | Active on X/Twitter (blurs leaks vs speculation) |

**Method:** Gathers intelligence from Apple's Asian supply chain contacts, translates into research notes. Shuns spotlight, doesn't do interviews.

## Track record

| Source | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| AppleTrack | 72.5% |
| AppleScoop | 80.95% |

**Notable correct calls:**
- White iPhone 4 delay (2011) — started his streak
- MacBook Pro Retina display (2012)
- Touch ID / iPhone 5s details (2013)
- Apple Watch Series 8 temperature sensing
- Apple Watch Ultra rugged design
- iPhone 14 Pro 48MP camera

**Caveats:** Twitter activity since 2022 has mixed actual supply chain intel with speculation. Research notes from TF International more reliable than social posts.
