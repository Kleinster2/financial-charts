Gen Z **secondhand fashion marketplace**. Social-first design (Instagram-like feed) targeting under-34 shoppers. Founded in London, acquired by [[Etsy]] in 2021, sold to [[eBay]] in Feb 2026.

## Ownership history

| Date | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2011 | Founded in London | — |
| Jun 2021 | Acquired by [[Etsy]] | **$1.625B** |
| Dec 2025 | Etsy CEO Josh Silverman steps down | — |

| Feb 2026 | Sold to [[eBay]] | **$1.2B** (~$400M loss for Etsy) |

Etsy's Depop acquisition is a case study in **overpaying for Gen Z hype** at the 2021 peak. Bought at $1.625B, sold 5 years later for $1.2B despite the platform growing.

## What makes it different

- **Social-first UX** — browse like Instagram, not like a search engine
- **Gen Z native** — 90% of buyers under 34, streetwear/vintage aesthetic
- **C2C only** — individual sellers, not brands or wholesalers
- **Community/culture** — sellers build followings, drops, personal brand

## Under eBay

eBay plans to integrate:
- Cross-listing (Depop inventory visible on eBay)
- Authenticity Guarantee for high-value items
- eBay shipping and financial services infrastructure
- Global scale (Depop was primarily US/UK)

Risk: eBay's corporate UX kills the community vibe that makes Depop work for Gen Z.

## Competitive landscape

| Platform | Model | Audience |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Depop** | C2C social-first | Gen Z, streetwear/vintage |
| [[Poshmark]] | C2C, social selling | Millennial women, mid-tier fashion |
| [[ThredUp]] | Consignment (ship-a-bag) | Broader, convenience-focused |
| [[Vinted]] | C2C, no seller fees | Europe-dominant |
| [[The RealReal]] | Luxury consignment | High-end, authenticated |
