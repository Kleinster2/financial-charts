# AppLovin

Mobile ad-tech platform connecting app developers with advertisers. Revenue from programmatic ad placement fees. Core asset is [[AXON]] AI engine that predicts user behavior using first-party data and probabilistic modeling—thrived while competitors struggled with Apple's ATT privacy changes.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | APP |
| Market cap | ~$180B (Jan 2026) |
| Revenue (2024) | $4.7B |
| Net income (2024) | $1.58B |
| Employees | ~1,500 |
| Founded | 2012 |
| IPO | April 15, 2021 ($70/share, $24B valuation) |
| CEO | [[Adam Foroughi]] |
| HQ | Palo Alto, CA |

## Business model

Three pillars after late-2025 divestiture of gaming ("Apps") to Tripledot Studios:

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AppDiscovery | User acquisition powered by AXON 2.0—helps advertisers find high-value users through predictive modeling. Primary revenue driver. |
| MAX | Header-bidding mediation platform—developers auction ad space to highest bidder in real-time |
| Adjust | Measurement and attribution suite for campaign tracking |

Revenue mix (2024): Advertising $3.22B (68% of total, +75% YoY), up from 56% in 2023. Pure software company now.

Margins: EBITDA margin hit 81% in advertising segment by Q1 2025.

## AXON AI engine

Crown jewel. Reinforcement learning model that predicts user intent without permanent device IDs. While [[Meta]], [[Google]], [[Snap]] struggled with iOS 14.5 ATT deprecating IDFA, AXON used first-party data and contextual signals to maintain high ROAS for advertisers.

AXON 3.0 (rolling out 2026) integrates generative AI to create ads in real-time, not just place them.

## E-commerce expansion

Breaking out of mobile gaming roots. AXON e-commerce ads hit $1B run rate by early 2025. Clients: Wayfair, Dr. Squatch, Ashley Furniture scaling six-figure daily budgets. [[Shopify]] integration lets SMB merchants access AXON with one click.

## Price chart

*vs [[Trade Desk|TTD]] · [[Unity Technologies|U]]*

From IPO (Apr 2021) through early 2023, tracked peers in the post-ZIRP mobile/ad-tech selloff. Diverged dramatically in 2024 as AXON 2.0 proved out—APP +700% in 2024 alone while TTD and Unity remained down 45-55% from peaks. Added to S&P 500 September 2025 (replaced MarketAxess).

## Fundamentals

![[app-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue plateaued 2022-2023 during mobile ad recession, then inflected sharply in 2024 with AXON 2.0 and e-commerce expansion. Net income swung from losses (2022) to $1.58B profit (2024)—43% net margin.*

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Margin |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| 2021 | $2.79B | $34M | 1% |

| 2023 | $3.28B | $357M | 11% |
| 2024 | $4.71B | $1.58B | 34% |

### Q4 2025 (Feb 11, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.66B | +66% |
| GAAP EPS | $3.24 | Beat by 10% |
| Adj EBITDA | $1.40B | +82% |
| EBITDA margin | 84.4% | +700bps |
| Operating margin | 76.9% | vs 44.3% prior yr |
| FCF | $1.31B | +88% |
| FCF margin | 79% | — |
| FY 2025 FCF | $3.95B | +91% |

Q1 2026 guidance: Revenue $1.745-1.775B (~52% YoY), adj EBITDA $1.465-1.495B (84% margin). Both above consensus.

84% EBITDA and 79% FCF margins are software industry records at this scale. Stock sold off despite the beat — swept up in broader software sector panic.

## Short seller attacks

Heavy short interest from activist researchers:

| Date | Short seller | Key claims |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Feb 2025 | Fuzzy Panda, Culper Research | Misleading AXON capability claims |
| Mar 2025 | [[Muddy Waters]] | "Scammy adtech"—extracts proprietary IDs from Meta/Snap/TikTok/Reddit/Google violating ToS; 52% of e-commerce conversions are retargeting not incremental |
| Jan 2026 | CapitalWatch | Latest attack |

Stock dropped 20% on Muddy Waters report (Mar 27, 2025)—$20B market cap wipeout. AppLovin retained Alex Spiro (Quinn Emanuel) to investigate short sellers.
