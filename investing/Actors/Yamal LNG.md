|------------|-----------|
| Monetizes Arctic gas reserves | Diversifies energy supply |
| Develops NSR infrastructure | Secures LNG outside US influence |
| Attracts non-Western capital | Builds Arctic shipping experience |

## Follow-on: Arctic LNG 2

Novatek's next project (19.8 mtpa):
- CNPC + CNOOC hold 20% combined
- Sanctions delaying Train 3 to 2028
- Same Arctic shipping model
