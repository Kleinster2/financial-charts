## Why Illumina matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ILMN |
| Market cap | ~$18B |
| 2025E revenue | **$4.27-4.31B** |
| NGS market share | **80%** |
| Employees | ~7,500 |

---

## Business model

| Segment | 2025 revenue | Growth |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Sequencing consumables | ~$2.9B | Flat |
| Sequencing instruments | ~$400M | -18% |
| Other (services, arrays) | ~$1B | Mixed |

**Razor/blade model:** Instruments placed, consumables recurring.

## NovaSeq X transition

| Metric | Q3 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| High-throughput GB on X | **78%** |
| High-throughput revenue on X | **51%** |
| Research transition | 80%+ complete |
| Clinical transition | ~55% complete |

**Impact:** Lower ASP per GB but higher volume, margin pressure during transition.

## Product portfolio

| Platform | Application | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **NovaSeq X** | High-throughput | Flagship |
| NovaSeq 6000 | High-throughput | Legacy |
| NextSeq 2000 | Mid-throughput | Growing |
| MiSeq | Low-throughput | Mature |
| iSeq | Benchtop | Entry |

---

## End markets

| Market | % of consumables | Trend |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Clinical** | ~60% | Growing double digits (ex-China) |
| Research | ~40% | Pressured (NIH funding) |

## China challenges

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Restrictions | $85M tariff costs (2025) |
| Revenue decline | Significant headwind |
| Guidance cut | 1-3% constant currency decline |

---

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Technology | Threat level |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| PacBio | Long-read | Moderate (different use cases) |
| Oxford Nanopore | Portable long-read | Growing |
| MGI (BGI) | Short-read | China-focused |
| Element Biosciences | Benchtop | Emerging |
| Ultima Genomics | Ultra-low cost | Early |

**Moat:** Installed base, clinical validation, regulatory clearances.
