**Artemis** — NASA's lunar exploration program. First crewed Moon landing since Apollo 17. Major contracts for [[SpaceX]], [[Blue Origin]], [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Northrop Grumman]].

## Why Artemis matters

| Element | Contractor | Contract value |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **SLS rocket** | [[Boeing]] | ~$23B cumulative |
| **Orion capsule** | [[Lockheed Martin]] | ~$20B cumulative |
| **Starship HLS** | [[SpaceX]] | $2.89B + $1.15B |
| **Blue Moon lander** | [[Blue Origin]] | $3.4B |
| **Gateway HALO** | [[Northrop Grumman]] | $935M |
| **Gateway PPE** | Maxar | $375M |
| **Spacesuits** | [[Axiom Space]] | ~$230M |

Largest NASA human spaceflight program since Space Shuttle.

## Mission timeline

| Mission | Target date | Milestone |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Artemis II** | Feb 2026 | Crewed lunar flyby (first humans beyond LEO since 1972) |
| **Artemis III** | Mid-2027 | First crewed landing (SpaceX Starship HLS) |
| **Artemis IV** | Late 2028 | Gateway docking, second landing |
| **Artemis V** | Early 2030 | Blue Origin Blue Moon lander debut |
| **Artemis VI** | Early 2031 | Continued exploration |

Artemis II crew: Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, Jeremy Hansen (first non-American on lunar mission).

## Lunar Gateway

**Planned space station in lunar orbit:**

| Module | Contractor | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| PPE (Power) | Maxar | Integration testing |
| HALO (Habitat) | [[Northrop Grumman]] | Stress testing complete |
| I-HAB | Thales Alenia Space | Development |

Launch: Dec 2027 on [[SpaceX]] Falcon Heavy. Won't be ready for Artemis III — astronauts will dock Orion directly with Starship HLS.

---

## Budget (FY2026)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Moon to Mars Transportation | $4.9B |
| Moon to Mars Systems | $2.8B |
| Human Exploration Architecture | $603M |
| **Total lunar exploration** | ~$7B+ |

Trump administration proposed canceling SLS/Orion/Gateway after Artemis III. Congress allocated $4.1B for Artemis IV-V SLS through 2032 via reconciliation bill.

## Human Landing System competition

**Two landers selected:**

| Lander | Contractor | First mission | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Starship HLS** | [[SpaceX]] | Artemis III | Requires orbital refueling |
| **Blue Moon** | [[Blue Origin]] | Artemis V | $7B total development (incl. Blue's contribution) |

NASA interim administrator reopened Starship HLS contract in early 2025 — both companies submitted revised architectures that could accelerate timeline.

---

## Risk factors

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Starship readiness** | HLS requires successful orbital refueling (undemonstrated) |
| **Budget uncertainty** | Political shifts, cost overruns |
| **SLS sustainability** | $2B+ per launch, cancellation pressure |
| **Schedule slippage** | NASA IG called timeline "unrealistic" |

GAO noted NASA lacks official Artemis III cost estimate despite $6.8B FY2024 request.

---

## Investment relevance

**Winners:**
- [[SpaceX]] — $4B+ in HLS contracts, Falcon Heavy for Gateway
- [[Blue Origin]] — $3.4B lander contract validates New Glenn/BE-4
- [[Northrop Grumman]] — Gateway modules
- [[Lockheed Martin]] — Orion continues through Artemis V+

**At risk:**
- [[Boeing]] — SLS cancellation post-Artemis III; Feb 2025 employee layoff warnings

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Program start | 2017 |
| Total cost (est.) | $93B through 2025 (NASA IG) |
| Goal | Sustainable lunar presence, Mars prep |
| First landing | Artemis III (mid-2027) |
