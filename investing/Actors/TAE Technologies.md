**TAE Technologies** — Nuclear fusion startup. Merging with Trump [[Media]] (TMTG) in $6B deal. Highly speculative.

---

## Why TAE matters

TAE represents the most speculative end of the AI power thesis — fusion:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Technology | Hydrogen-boron fusion (aneutronic) |
| Status | Pre-commercial, no working reactor |
| [[Target]] | First 50 MWe plant by 2031 |
| Differentiator | Cleaner than deuterium-tritium fusion |

## TMTG merger (Dec 2025)

**Deal structure:**
- $6B all-stock merger
- 50/50 ownership split
- TMTG becomes holding company for TAE
- $200M cash to TAE at signing, +$100M available

**Leadership:**
- Devin Nunes (TMTG CEO) + Michl Binderbauer (TAE CEO) as co-CEOs
- Trump owns ~42% of TMTG via trust (Don Jr. trustee)

**Timeline:** Expected close mid-2026, subject to approvals

---

## Trump conflict of interest

**The problem:**
- President Trump has major financial interest in TAE via TMTG
- TAE needs government approvals, DOE support, NRC licensing
- Trump administration controls those agencies

**Ethics concerns:**
- Glaring conflict of interest
- Government decisions directly affect Trump's net worth
- No precedent for sitting president owning fusion company

## Investors (pre-merger)

| Investor | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| [[Google]]/Alphabet | Strategic |
| [[Chevron]] | Energy major |
| Various VCs | $1.3B+ total raised |

## Technology: Hydrogen-boron fusion

**TAE's approach:**
- Hydrogen-boron (p-B11) fuel cycle
- "Aneutronic" — produces fewer neutrons than D-T fusion
- Less radioactive waste
- Higher technical difficulty

**Why it matters:**
- If it works, cleaner than other fusion approaches
- But even harder to achieve than "standard" fusion
- D-T fusion hasn't reached commercial scale; p-B11 is harder

## Fusion vs fission

| | Fission | Fusion |
|---|---|---|
| **Works today?** | Yes | No (commercially) |
| **Examples** | [[Constellation Energy]], [[Oklo]] | TAE, Commonwealth Fusion |
| **Risk** | Regulatory, cost | Technical feasibility |
| **Timeline** | Now to 2030s | 2030s+ (if ever) |

**The joke:** "Fusion is 30 years away, and always has been."

---

## Power plant plans

**If merger closes:**
- Site selection and construction start 2026
- First 50 MWe plant targeted 2031
- Larger plants (350-500 MWe) planned after

**Reality check:** No fusion company has achieved commercial power generation. Ever.

## Investment case

**Bull (extremely speculative):**
- If fusion works, it's unlimited clean energy
- Trump administration support = regulatory tailwinds
- [[Google]]/[[Chevron]] backing = smart money validation
- Hydrogen-boron is cleaner than alternatives

**Bear:**
- Fusion has never worked commercially
- Technical feasibility unproven
- 2031 timeline almost certainly optimistic
- TMTG is a meme stock, adds volatility
- Ethics concerns could create political risk
- Even if fusion works, may not be TAE's approach

---

## For AI power thesis

**Relevance:** Near-zero for 2025-2030 timeframe

Fusion is a 2030s+ story at best. For near-term AI power needs, fission ([[Constellation Energy]], [[Oklo]]) and gas are the real solutions.

TAE is a lottery ticket, not an investment thesis.
