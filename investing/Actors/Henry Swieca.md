## Background

Son of two Polish Holocaust survivors who emigrated from [[France]] to the [[United States]] via France in 1955. Both parents died when Swieca was 19 — mother from ALS, father from heart attack six months later. Taken in by the Dubin family (parents of [[Glenn Dubin]]) during college breaks.

Used ~$50K inheritance to buy 1,000 shares of Warner Communications, then leveraged those shares as collateral for options trading — doubled the investment over two years, funding his and his brother's education. Introduced to markets by an uncle who was a dentist and avid stock investor.

Renamed [[Corbin Capital Partners]] in 2005 ("Corbin" from the intersection in Washington Heights where the founders met at age five). Corbin continues to operate (~$4.1B AUM).

### Highbridge Capital Management (1992–2009)

Co-founded with [[Glenn Dubin]], seeded with $35M. Named after the 19th-century High Bridge aqueduct connecting Washington Heights to the Bronx. Swieca served as CIO (trading, risk, portfolio construction, quant analysis); Dubin as CEO (business development, investor relations).

### Talpion Fund Management (2010–present)

Single family office managing Swieca's personal fortune. Name from Biblical Hebrew "Talpiot" (castle turret).

Four asset classes:
1. Public securities — fundamental long-term + short-term volatility across equities, credit, relative value, macro
2. Real estate — multifamily residential in NYC, with in-house design and construction
3. Private equity
4. Venture capital — through QB1 Ventures (early-stage tech, edtech focus)

Seeding activity: In 2012, Talpion seeded [[Marc Majzner]]'s [[Clearline Capital]] with $50M (+ $20M from Swieca family). Majzner had worked at Talpion for two years after joining from [[North Run Capital]]. Clearline returned 26%+ net in 2012. Operates from Talpion offices using Talpion infrastructure. Swieca receives a profit share. Got the seeding model from [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], who does the same from his family office.

## Controversies

### Columbia resignation (Oct 2023)

Resigned from [[Columbia Business School]] Board of Overseers (joined 2014), citing university's response to campus antisemitism after the Israel-Hamas war. Called the campus "unsafe" for Jews, accused the university of allowing anti-Jewish student groups and professors to operate with impunity. Part of a broader wave of Jewish donors (including [[Leon Cooperman]]) distancing from Ivy League institutions.

### Epstein connection (indirect)

[[Jeffrey Epstein]] invested millions in [[Highbridge Capital Management]] and received a $15M fee from the [[JPMorgan Chase]] acquisition (2004). However, the personal Epstein relationship was primarily with co-founder [[Glenn Dubin]] (whose wife Eva Andersson-Dubin dated Epstein for 11 years). Swieca does not appear to have had a direct personal relationship with Epstein.
