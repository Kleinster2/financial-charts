| **Gas** | 2022 | Sold to [[Discord]], 10M downloads |

Both apps: teen-focused, positivity/compliment mechanics, viral school-by-school rollout, zero marketing spend.

## Philosophy

**Core principles:**
- Optimize for "aha moment" in 3 seconds
- Cut features ruthlessly
- No paid marketing — viral loops only
- Launch school-by-school, not nationwide
- Pre-fill content so app feels alive on first open

**On consumer apps:** Most fail because they show an empty feed on first open. Users need to see value immediately.
