## Context

**Part of broader pattern:**
- Many newcomers entering AI data center market
- Attracted by $178.5B US data center credit volume (2025)
- Racing to build before capacity needs materialize
- Howard Marks, others warn of overbuild risk

---

## Investment relevance

**Cautionary example:**
- Large announced project without anchor tenant
- Tests whether AI demand matches buildout pace
- If successful: validates European AI infrastructure
- If fails: confirms overbuild thesis
