## Why XRG matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) |
| Enterprise value | **$151 billion** |
| CEO | Khaldoon Al Mubarak |
| Focus | International energy investments, AI power |

Spin-off from ADNOC to deploy Abu Dhabi's energy wealth into global energy infrastructure — including power systems for AI data centers.

## Leadership

| Role | Name | Other roles |
|------|------|-------------|
| CEO | Khaldoon Al Mubarak | [[Mubadala]] CEO, Manchester City chairman |

Khaldoon runs both Mubadala ($330B) and XRG ($151B) — connecting sovereign capital with energy infrastructure.

---

## Strategic focus

| Area | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **AI data center power** | Data centers consume massive energy |
| **International energy assets** | Diversify beyond UAE oil |
| **LNG/gas** | Transition fuel |
| **Nuclear/renewables** | Long-term power mix |

**AI angle:** As AI infrastructure scales, power becomes the bottleneck. XRG positions Abu Dhabi to profit from — and supply — that energy demand.
