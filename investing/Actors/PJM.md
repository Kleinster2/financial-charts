## 60 GW shortfall warning (Feb 2026)

PJM warned of a potential **60 GW** power supply shortfall over the next decade as [[Data Centers|data centers]] accelerate demand growth.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projected shortfall | **60 GW** (next decade) |
| Last auction shortfall (Dec 2025) | 6.5 GW |
| Cost to solve 60 GW gap | **~$180B** |
| Cost to solve last auction gap | ~$15B |
| Reliability gap starts | Mid-2027 |

- Not enough generators to meet peak demand + required reserves from mid-2027
- Trump administration pushing PJM to hold **emergency wholesale electricity auction** later in 2026 to support AI data centers
- PJM plans to file with federal regulators in May, hold special procurement in September
- Current method = 12-month [[Capacity market|capacity contracts]] via auction; discussion about shifting to 10-year commitments
- 1 GW ≈ output of one large nuclear reactor ≈ enough for ~800K homes

## Why this matters for investors

60 GW = roughly 60 new large nuclear reactors' worth of capacity needed. This is the most concrete quantification of the [[Power infrastructure bottleneck]] from the entity most responsible for US grid reliability. Beneficiaries: gas turbine makers ([[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]]), nuclear ([[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]], [[Oklo]]), grid infrastructure ([[Quanta Services]]).
