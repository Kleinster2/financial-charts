# Yangshan Deep Water Port

World's busiest container port, located 30 km offshore from Shanghai on reclaimed islands. Operated by [[SIPG]].

## Key Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total investment | $20B+ | Video transcript |
| Location | 30 km offshore, East China Sea | — |
| Connection | Donghai Bridge (32.5 km) | — |
| Water depth | 15m+ (handles largest vessels) | — |
| Construction start | 2002 | — |

## Throughput

| Period | Yangshan | Shanghai total | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------|
| H1 2025 | 14.026M TEU | 27.065M TEU | +7.3% YoY |
| 2024 | 50M+ TEU | — | First port globally to hit this |

Yangshan handles >50% of Shanghai's total throughput.

For comparison: H1 2025 throughput exceeds entire annual throughput of Port of Los Angeles.

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| I-III | Operational | Traditional + semi-automated |
| IV | Operational (2017) | World's largest fully automated terminal, $2.15B |
| Xiao Yang Shan (north) | Under construction | Opens 2026 |

## Xiao Yang Shan Expansion (2025-2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Designed capacity | 11.6M TEU |
| Ship size | Up to 70,000 tons |
| Shoreline extension | 6+ km |
| Land reclamation | ~100M cubic meters |
| First section | 2026 |

## Phase IV Automation

Equipment from [[ZPMC]]:
- 28 automated quay cranes (dual-trolley, +50% efficiency)
- 121 automated rail-mounted gantry cranes
- 145 automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
- AI-powered terminal operating system
- Remote-operated cranes (no operators in cab)
- 24/7 operation with minimal workforce

Partners: [[Huawei]] (5G), [[Alibaba]] Cloud (software, blockchain tracking)

## Geopolitical Events

**Aug 2025:** US sanctioned Yang Shan Shengong fuel storage facility over alleged Iranian oil handling. Caused immediate spike in China fuel futures volatility.

**2025:** Shanghai signed green/digital shipping corridor deal with Port of Barcelona — cleaner ships, shared digital systems.

## Strategic Significance

- **Chokepoint**: Handles significant share of China's exports and trans-Pacific trade
- **Belt and Road**: Key node in China's global logistics network
- **Showcase**: Demonstrates China's [[Port automation]] capabilities
- **Vulnerability**: Single point of failure; exposed to typhoons, cyber risk

## Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Cyber | AI-dependent systems; major glitch could paralyze operations |
| Geopolitical | Sanctions exposure (Aug 2025 example) |
| Environmental | Marine ecosystem disruption from reclamation |
| Climate | Storm surge, sea level rise on offshore facility |
