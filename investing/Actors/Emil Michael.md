## Significance

Michael controls the Pentagon's $140B+ annual R&D budget — deciding which technologies get funded, which startups get defense contracts, and how the military adopts AI, autonomous systems, and next-gen weapons. His Uber background signals the Trump administration's preference for Silicon Valley operators over traditional defense bureaucrats.

His career arc (Obama-era Pentagon → Uber → Trump-era Pentagon) mirrors the bipartisan nature of defense tech's political support — both parties want Silicon Valley running military technology.
