## Why it matters

- **Meta's hardware partner** — manufactures Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses
- **Meta took 3% stake** ($3.5B, July 2025) — may expand to 5%
- **Smart glasses growth** — Ray-Ban Meta sales 3x'd YoY in Q1 2025
- **Picks-and-shovels play** on screenless AI wearables

## Meta partnership

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Partnership start | 2019 |
| Meta stake | ~3% (~$3.5B, July 2025) |
| Potential expansion | To 5% |
| Products | Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses |

**Timeline:**
- 2021: First Ray-Ban Stories launched (modest success)
- 2023: Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 (breakout hit)
- Q1 2025: Sales **tripled** YoY
- July 2025: Meta takes equity stake
- Q3 2025: Shares hit all-time high on wearables momentum

**Strategic value:** EssilorLuxottica provides manufacturing, fashion credibility, and retail distribution. Meta provides AI and tech. Neither could do it alone.

## Business segments

| Segment | Brands |
|---------|--------|
| Luxury eyewear | Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol |
| Lenses | Essilor, Varilux |
| Retail | LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Target Optical |
| Licenses | Chanel, Prada, Armani, Versace |

**Vertical integration:** Designs, manufactures, AND retails eyewear. Massive distribution moat.

## Smart glasses opportunity

**Why EssilorLuxottica wins:**
- Already makes glasses people want to wear
- Global retail footprint for distribution
- Fashion credibility (vs. "Glasshole" stigma)
- Manufacturing scale

**Risk:** If smart glasses go mainstream, becomes a hardware margin play rather than luxury brand play.

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Screenless AI]] | Picks-and-shovels — whoever wins smart glasses, EL manufactures |
| [[Long Meta]] | Validates Meta's hardware bet; 3% stake = alignment |

## What to watch

- [ ] Meta stake expansion to 5%
- [ ] Ray-Ban Meta Gen 3 (full AR features?)
- [ ] Smart glasses attach rate at retail
