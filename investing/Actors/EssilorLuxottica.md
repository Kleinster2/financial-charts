## Meta smart glasses partnership

EssilorLuxottica's biggest growth catalyst — and biggest strategic risk.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Partner since | 2019 |
| Units sold (2025) | **7M+** (3x from 2M cumulative in 2023-24) |
| Latest model | Ray-Ban Display ($799, hand gestures, neural control, small display) |
| Production target | Discussing **20M units** by end of 2026 |
| Deal structure | Long-term partnership extended "into next decade" (2024) |

**The bull case:** Iconic brands drive adoption where tech companies can't. 7M units in one year proves eyewear brands matter for wearable AI. Meta needs EssilorLuxottica more than reverse.

**The bear case:** [[Apple]] N50 glasses going in-house on frames (Feb 2026, -7% stock reaction). [[Google]] partnered with [[Warby Parker]], not Essilor. If tech companies conclude they can design premium frames themselves, EssilorLuxottica becomes a bypassed middleman. The brand premium erodes when the value shifts to the AI platform, not the frame.

## AI disruption exposure

EssilorLuxottica sits at the intersection of two disruption vectors:

1. **Tech companies designing own frames** — Apple N50 going in-house, premium acrylic materials. If this succeeds, the playbook spreads. See [[AI hardware vertical integration]].

2. **AI commoditizing luxury brand value** — When the glasses' value is primarily the AI assistant (Siri, Meta AI), the frame brand becomes secondary. Similar to how smartphone value shifted from hardware design to software ecosystem.

**Current position:** Strong — Meta partnership is thriving, 7M units proves brand pull. But the -7% on Apple N50 news shows the market sees the risk.
