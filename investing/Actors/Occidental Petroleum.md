## Price vs Permian peers

![[oxy-vs-dvn-vs-fang-price-chart.png]]
*OXY down ~20% since Jan 2023 vs FANG (Diamondback) +40%. OXY's CrownRock-driven debt load and lower oil prices weighed on the stock. DVN has tracked similarly to OXY. Buffett's continued buying has provided a floor but not enough to close the gap with higher-quality Permian names.*

## Financials

![[oxy-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked at $36B in 2022 (post-Russia/Ukraine oil spike), normalizing to ~$27B. Net income fell from $13B (2022) to $3B (2024) as oil prices mean-reverted. 2020 loss of $14.8B reflects the Anadarko goodwill impairment.*

## Key events

### CrownRock acquisition (Aug 2024)

Acquired Midland Basin producer CrownRock for ~$12B (including debt assumption). Added 170 Mboe/d production and 1,700 Permian drilling locations. Increased sub-$40 breakeven inventory by 33%. Funded with debt — pushed leverage to uncomfortable levels, driving much of the stock underperformance.

### OxyChem sale to [[Berkshire Hathaway]] (Jan 2026)

Sold chemicals division for $9.7B cash. OxyChem generated ~$5B revenue and ~$1B pre-tax income annually (PVC, caustic soda, chlorine). Retained all environmental liabilities. Proceeds: $6.5B to debt reduction, remainder for balance sheet flexibility. Enables return to buybacks and eventual redemption of Berkshire preferred equity (targeted Aug 2029).

### [[Berkshire Hathaway]] relationship

Buffett first invested in 2019, providing $10B preferred stock to fund the [[Anadarko Petroleum]] acquisition. Has since accumulated ~265M common shares (~28.3%). Warrants to buy ~84M additional shares at $59.59. Total Berkshire economic interest >30%. Buffett has said he may own OXY "forever." [[Greg Abel]] now oversees the position following Buffett's retirement as CEO (Jan 2026).

## STRATOS direct air capture

Oxy Low Carbon Ventures' STRATOS facility in the Permian Basin — designed to capture 500,000 tonnes CO2/year. Phase 1 commissioning mid-2025. Partnership with [[1PointFive]] (OXY subsidiary). Revenue from carbon credits and enhanced oil recovery. Speculative economics — depends on 45Q tax credits and voluntary carbon market pricing.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- [[Warren Buffett]] ~28% ownership provides floor and strategic optionality
- Post-OxyChem balance sheet reset — debt declining toward $15B
- Record Permian production at competitive breakevens
- DAC/carbon capture optionality if credits scale
- Potential buyback restart in 2026

Bear:
- Still highly leveraged vs peers even after debt reduction
- $800M/year Berkshire preferred dividend is dilutive
- [[Oil]] price sensitivity — breakeven higher than pure Permian peers
- OxyChem sale removes stable, countercyclical earnings stream
- International exposure ([[Algeria]], [[Oman]]) carries geopolitical risk

---

## 2026 guidance

- Production: flat to +2% growth
- Capex: $6.3-6.7B (down from prior years)
- Principal debt target: <$15B
- Morningstar FV estimate: $59/share (assumes $58 WTI, $4.52 HH)
- Analyst consensus: Hold (50%), Buy (34%), Sell (17%)
