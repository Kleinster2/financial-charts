| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $12B+ (Nov 2025) |
| Properties | 235 |
| Residential units | 25,000+ |
| Hotel keys | 5,100+ |
| Commercial/industrial | 15M+ sq ft |
| Development pipeline | $3.5B |

---

## Portfolio composition

| Segment | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| **Multifamily** | 25,000+ units in 28 states |
| **Hospitality** | 8 Moxy Hotels (NYC, LA, Miami), 5,100+ keys |

## Ownership

**100% privately held by [[David Lichtenstein]].** No outside PE or VC investors in the parent company.

| Entity | Owner | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Lightstone Group LLC | [[David Lichtenstein]] | Founded 1988, bootstrapped |
| 5 public REITs | Public shareholders | $1.8B combined AUM |
| Lightstone DIRECT deals | Co-invest with accredited investors | Min 20% Lightstone equity |

**Capital structure:** Lichtenstein retained full ownership through organic growth. REITs raise outside capital but operate under Lightstone management. Extended Stay bankruptcy (2009) resulted in $100M personal loss but did not dilute parent company ownership.

## Extended Stay bankruptcy (2007-2009)

**The acquisition:** June 2007, bought Extended Stay Hotels (687 hotels, 76,000 rooms) from [[Blackstone]] for $8B — financed with $7B debt.

**The collapse:** Great Recession killed travel demand. Extended Stay filed Chapter 11 on June 15, 2009. Lichtenstein personally liable for $100M via "bad boy" clause.

**The comeback:** Pivoted to Moxy Hotels concept, rebuilt portfolio. By 2025, AUM recovered to $12B+.
