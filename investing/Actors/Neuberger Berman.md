## SpaceX exposure

Neuberger Quality Equity fund (managed by Dan Hanson) holds a concentrated position in [[SpaceX]]. Hanson owns only 35 stocks with ~10% annual turnover. The fund ranks in the top 10% of Morningstar's large blend category over 3 years.

Also offers Next Generation Space Economy Fund (UCITS) investing in companies benefiting from the space economy.

Key point for [[Destiny Tech100]] context: investors can access SpaceX at NAV through Neuberger mutual funds, vs paying a premium through DXYZ.
