## Index Composition

**S&P Regional [[Banks]] Select Industry Index** — Pure regional bank exposure, excludes large diversified banks (JPM, BAC, C, WFC).

**Equal-weighted** — Each regional bank gets roughly equal weight, providing balanced exposure across ~140 names. No concentration in any single stock.

---

## Why Regionals Matter

**Rate sensitivity:** Regional banks more exposed to net interest margin compression/expansion. Rising rates = wider NIMs = outperformance.

**CRE exposure:** Higher concentration in commercial real estate lending than large banks. Office distress in 2023-2024 hit regionals hard.

**M&A targets:** Regionals are perennial acquisition targets by larger banks seeking deposits and branch networks.

## 2023 Banking Crisis Impact

KRE was ground zero for the March 2023 regional bank crisis:

| Event | Impact on KRE |
|-------|---------------|
| SVB collapse (Mar 2023) | -28% in one week |
| First [[Republic]] failure | Extended decline |
| Signature Bank closure | Contagion fears |

The crisis exposed duration mismatch risk at regional banks holding long-dated securities funded by short-term deposits.

## Top Holdings (representative)

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Western Alliance]] | Commercial banking |
| [[East West Bancorp]] | [[Asia]]-focused |
| [[Zions Bancorporation]] | Western US |
| [[Regions Financial]] | Southeast US |
| [[Huntington Bancshares]] | Midwest |
| [[KeyCorp]] | Midwest |
| [[Citizens Financial]] | Northeast |

*Equal-weighted so each regional gets similar exposure.*

## Use Case

Sector benchmark for **regional bank** analysis. When charting [[Western Alliance]], [[Zions]], [[Regions Financial]], include KRE to show relative performance.

For analysis that includes large banks ([[JPMorgan]], [[Bank of America]]), use [[KBE]] instead.
