## Dermatological beauty — the growth story

| Brand | Revenue | Growth | Category context |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Eucerin | €1.37B | +10.6% | Dermatological beauty fastest-growing sub-segment |
| Nivea | €5.6B | +9% | Adding dermatological positioning |
| La Roche-Posay (L'Oréal) | — | +16% | Key competitor |
| CeraVe (L'Oréal) | — | +20%+ | Key competitor |

Beiersdorf's Eucerin is #2 in dermatological beauty behind L'Oréal's CeraVe/La Roche-Posay. Category growing 16%+ driven by ingredient-savvy consumers.

## La Prairie — the China problem

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue | €509M (-6.2%) |
| Issue | China + travel retail weakness |
| Price point | $200-$1,000+ (ultra-luxury skincare) |
| Outlook | Further weakness expected in 2025 |

La Prairie mirrors [[Estée Lauder]]'s problem: ultra-luxury skincare over-indexed to Chinese consumers and Asia travel retail.

---

## 2025 outlook

| Metric | 2025E |
|--------|-------|
| Organic growth | +4% to +6% |
| Headwinds | La Prairie/China, tough comps |
| Drivers | Nivea, Eucerin, Americas/EMEA |

Growth expected to decelerate further, primarily due to luxury/China headwinds and strong prior-year comparisons.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Nivea: €5.6B brand growing +9% — exceptional for scale/maturity
- Eucerin becoming second billion-euro brand (dermatological beauty tailwind)
- Consistent above-market growth (6-10% for 3 years)
- Defensive characteristics — skincare is non-discretionary vs luxury
- Family-controlled (50.5%) = long-term orientation
- Net profit +20% growth, EPS €4.05

**Bear:**
- La Prairie declining (China/travel retail exposure)
- Growth decelerating (10.5% → 6.5% → 4-6%E)
- L'Oréal dominating dermatological category (CeraVe, La Roche-Posay)
- ~35x PE — not cheap for a mass skincare company
- tesa segment = industrial conglomerate discount
- No fragrance franchise (fastest-growing beauty category)
