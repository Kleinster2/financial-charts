## Why Xiaomi matters for this vault

Major smartphone OEM publicly warning on memory costs:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Business | Smartphones, IoT, EVs |
| Memory impact | +25% DRAM cost/phone (2026 budget) |
| Response | Raising device prices |
| Position | #3 global smartphone |

---

## Memory cost impact

**CFO public warning:**
- Memory costs = principal driver of higher retail prices
- Budgeting ~25% increase in DRAM expense per phone (2026)
- Passing costs to consumers

**Xiaomi 15 pricing:**
- Memory cost surge cited for higher MSRP
- Premium tier hit hardest (more RAM)

---

## Smartphone business

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global rank | #3 (behind Apple, Samsung) |
| Markets | China, India, Europe |
| Strategy | Value flagship |
| Memory per phone | 8-16GB typical |

**Value positioning problem:** Xiaomi known for price/performance. Memory costs threaten this.

---

## Memory exposure by segment

| Segment | Memory intensity |
|---------|------------------|
| **Smartphones** | High (8-16GB DRAM, 256GB+ storage) |
| **IoT/Smart home** | Lower |
| **EVs (new)** | Moderate |

Smartphones = bulk of memory exposure.

---

## Comparison to peers

| Smartphone OEM | Response |
|----------------|----------|
| **Xiaomi** | +25% memory budget, raising prices |
| Oppo | Optimizing specs (less RAM?) |
| Vivo | Same approach |
| [[Samsung]] | Vertically integrated (makes own memory) |
| [[Apple]] | Premium pricing absorbs costs |

Non-vertically-integrated Android OEMs hurt most.

## Samsung advantage

[[Samsung]] makes its own memory — vertical integration insulates them. Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo are pure buyers with no leverage.

---

## EV business (tangent)

**Xiaomi SU7:**
- Electric vehicle launched 2024
- Growing rapidly in China
- Less memory-intensive than phones
- Diversification from smartphone squeeze

---

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- Memory costs crushing smartphone margins
- No vertical integration
- Competition from Samsung (integrated)
- China market saturation

**Bull:**
- EV diversification
- Strong brand in emerging markets
- If memory normalizes
- IoT ecosystem
