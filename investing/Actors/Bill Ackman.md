## GSE trade (Jan 2025-2026)

**The bet:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Position | Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac common |
| Avg cost | ~$2.40 |
| [[Target]] | **$31** (late 2026 IPO) |
| Implied return | **~1,200%** |

**Thesis:**
- Trump will privatize GSEs
- Treasury counts past distributions as senior preferred payback
- GSEs raise ~$30B combined for capital requirements
- Government makes ~$300B profit
- IPO late 2026

**Dec 2024 X post:** Laid out bull case, stocks jumped 45% in less than an hour.

## Prior GSE attempt

**First try (2013+):**
- Bought hundreds of millions in GSE shares
- Bet on restructuring and release
- Lawsuits against government (net worth sweep) repeatedly failed
- [[Trade]] didn't pay off during Trump 1.0

**Why different now:**
- Biden released roadmap for conservatorship end
- Trump team renewed privatization vow
- More political momentum

---

## Mortgage policy proposals (Jan 2026)

**Prepayment penalty idea:**
- Add prepayment penalties to new mortgages
- Could shave **~65bps** off rates (6.16% → ~5.5%)
- Rationale: MBS investors demand spread for prepay optionality
- Customizable lockouts (5yr, 10yr, etc.)

**Ackman:**
> "Locking in the 65 bps savings upfront over the life of the mortgage may be the difference between the borrower being able to afford the home and not."

**Pushback — Kevin Jackson ([[Wells Fargo]]):**
> "There is no empirical evidence whatsoever that suggests more prepayment penalty originations correspond to significantly lower mortgage rates. A terrible position to put the borrower into."

**Policy access:** Ackman has pitched ideas directly to Trump, Bessent, Lutnick, and Pulte.

---

## Bull case

**Ackman on X:**
> "Trump and his team will get the job done. Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history."

| Factor | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Trump priority | Shrink government role |
| Biden roadmap | Path laid out |
| $300B profit | Political win |
| Biggest IPO ever | Appeal to Trump |

---

## Bear case / risks

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Donald Layton** (ex-Freddie CEO) | Won't benefit working class voters, could raise mortgage costs |
| **Michael Kao** (Akanthos) | Shareholders "massively diluted" without government largesse |
| **Brian Violino** (Wedbush) | Sell rating — dilution degrades current value |
| **Mark Zandi** ([[Moody's]]) | Disruptions likely, not a priority for "little guy" president |
| **Mark Calabria** (ex-FHFA) | Retiring senior preferred was "political nonstarter" in Trump 1.0 |

**Key risk:** Treasury converts to common → massive dilution vs. writing down $300B.
