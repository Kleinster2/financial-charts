## Generic threat (2026)

**Patent cliff looming:**

| Market | Patent Status | Timeline |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **[[Canada]]** | Expired Jan 4, 2026 | Generics Q3 2026 |
| **[[China]]** | Expiring 2026 | 10+ companies filed |
| **[[India]]** | Expiring 2026 | Novo lost lawsuits blocking generics |
| **[[Brazil]]** | Expiring soon | Major market |
| **US/[[UK]]/[[EU]]** | Protected until 2031+ | Safe for now |

**Generic market:** Could reach **$8B/year by 2030** (Nomura).

**Price impact:**

| Market | Expected generic price |
|--------|------------------------|
| [[India]] | **$15-40/month** (vs $97+ branded) |
| [[China]] | **~$50/month** |
| [[Canada]] | 65% discount with 3+ competitors |

**Key generic players:**
- Sandoz (Swiss giant)
- Aspen Pharmacare (South [[Africa]])
- Dr Reddy's ([[India]]) — targeting 87 markets
- Huadong Medicine, CSPC ([[China]])

**CEO Mike Doustdar:** Expects most generics to arrive Q2 2026. "We will not stop fighting commercially."

**US leakage risk:** Florida allows Canadian imports — could create market leakage problem.

**1/3 of adults with obesity** live in countries affected by 2026 patent expiries (IQVIA).

## 2026 guidance shock (Feb 3, 2026)

Novo issued the worst guidance in a decade. Stock fell **-16.4% on the day** (Feb 4), down **~20% for the week**.

### 2026 outlook

| Metric | 2026 Guide | 2025 Actual |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Sales growth (CER) | **-5% to -13%** | +10% |
| Operating profit growth (CER) | **-5% to -13%** | Growth |
| Consensus expectation | -2% sales | — |

**First contraction in nearly a decade.** Ends years of double-digit percentage gains since Wegovy launch (June 2021).

### Drivers of decline

- **US pricing pressure:** Trump MFN drug pricing deals + "unprecedented" competitive pricing
- **Competition:** [[Eli Lilly]] Mounjaro/Zepbound gaining share rapidly (58% US GLP-1 share)
- **Patent expiries:** Semaglutide patents expiring in [[Canada]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] in 2026
- **Compounding pharmacies:** Continued erosion of US market

### Executive departures

Two top executives leaving simultaneously:

| Departing | Role | Replacement | Background |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| Dave Moore | Head of US operations | **Jamey Millar** | Ex-[[UnitedHealth Group]] |
| Ludovic Helfgott | Head of product & portfolio strategy | **Hong Chow** | Ex-Merck Healthcare ([[Germany]]) |

### CEO commentary

CEO **Mike Doustdar**: "In 2026, Novo Nordisk will face pricing headwinds in an increasingly competitive market." But "very encouraged by the promising early uptake from the U.S. launch of Wegovy pill."
