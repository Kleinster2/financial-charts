# Rolex

**World's dominant watch brand** — privately held (Hans Wilsdorf Foundation), CHF 10.6B revenue (2024), 32% market share of Swiss watches. The "Big Four" private brands (Rolex, Patek, AP, Richard Mille) now control 48% of the market, up from 37% in 2019. Rolex alone is larger than the next three combined.

- All private, all growing while listed groups lose share

## Why Rolex wins

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Scarcity** | Intentional production limits (1.18M/yr) |
| **Pricing power** | Annual increases, no discounting |
| **Resale value** | Many models trade above retail |
| **Brand recognition** | \#1 luxury brand globally (multiple surveys) |
| **Foundation ownership** | No shareholder pressure, infinite time horizon |
| **Vertical integration** | Own foundry, movements, dials, cases |

---

## Production strategy

Rolex **reduced** production in 2024 to 1.18M units despite strong demand. Strategy:
- Maintain scarcity and waitlists
- Push average selling price higher
- Keep secondary market premiums
- Avoid oversupply that plagued industry in past cycles

---

## Secondary market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Chrono24 share | **34.2%** of global trade volume (2020-2024) |
| Key models | Submariner, Daytona, GMT-Master II |
| Premium vs retail | Most sport models trade at or above retail |

---

## Real estate strategy

Like [[LVMH]], [[Kering]], [[Prada]], Rolex has been buying prime retail locations:
- Multiple Fifth Avenue properties (2023-2024)
- Part of broader luxury buying spree on [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]]

---

## Industry context

The Swiss watch industry contracted ~3% in 2024 (top 50 brands: CHF 35.3B). But the decline was entirely in listed groups:
- **Swatch Group** (Omega, Longines): Lost share
- **Richemont** watchmaking: +7% (Cartier strength)
- **Private brands**: Still growing

**Structural shift:** Luxury watches are concentrating into fewer, more exclusive brands — similar to broader luxury bifurcation.

---

## 2025 outlook

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Price increases** | Up to +20% to offset tariffs/costs |
| **[[China]] demand** | Subdued, not yet recovering |
| **Certified pre-owned** | Rolex launched official CPO program (2022) |
| **Tariff exposure** | Swiss manufacturing, global retail |

---

## Investment implications

**Not investable** (foundation-owned), but matters as:
- Bellwether for ultra-luxury demand
- Competitive pressure on [[Richemont]] (Cartier), Swatch (Omega)
- Secondary market prices signal wealth/confidence
- Real estate buyer on Fifth Avenue
