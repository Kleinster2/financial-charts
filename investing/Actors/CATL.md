## Technology roadmap

**2026 launches:**
- **Sodium-ion batteries** — large-scale availability by end of 2026
- Battery swapping, passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, energy storage applications

**LFP dominance:**
- Lower cost vs NMC
- No cobalt/nickel dependency
- Tesla Model 3/Y standard range use CATL LFP

## Global expansion

**Flagship of China's outbound investment surge:**

| Project | Location | Investment | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Arnstadt** | Germany | **$2B** | 2,000 employees, growing |
| **Indonesia** | Karawang | **$6B** | Groundbreaking June 2025 |
| Stellantis JV | Spain | — | 50 GWh, 2026 |
| Hungary | Debrecen | — | 100 GWh, operating |

**Germany contrast (Jan 2026):**
- CATL Arnstadt: Expanding, hiring
- Ford Cologne: Cutting 1,000 jobs, single shift

**Indonesia:** Part of Chinese push to control EV battery supply chain from nickel refining to cell production.

See [[Capital flow reversal]] — CATL exemplifies China building factories abroad rather than buying trophy assets.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Unassailable market leadership
- Technology moat (LFP, sodium-ion)
- Tesla/VW/BMW locked in
- Energy storage growth (grid-scale)
- Vertical integration

**Bear:**
- China exposure (tariffs, geopolitics)
- Pricing pressure from BYD
- Western localization costs
- Overcapacity risk in China
