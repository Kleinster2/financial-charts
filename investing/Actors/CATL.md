## The "self-funding bank" model

CATL operates with **negative working capital** — it collects from customers before paying suppliers, effectively using supplier financing to fund its explosive capex. This is the machine beneath the margin story: the company self-funds growth from its dominant position in the supply chain, similar to how Amazon or Dell historically operated.

**Key metrics (TSCS/Ozeco analysis, Nov 2025):**
- Operating margins ~17% (2024)
- **~18% incremental returns** on new factory investment
- Revenue growth guided 20-25%
- Valuation trajectory: $10B (2018 SZSE) → $170B (May 2025 HKEX) → **~$250B** (late 2025)

## Tesla relationship

| Year | Tesla % of CATL revenue |
|------|------------------------|
| 2021 | 10% |
| 2022 | 11.6% |

CATL seen as leader in LFP (lithium iron phosphate) technology — Tesla's preferred chemistry for standard range vehicles.

## Technology roadmap

**2026 launches:**
- **[[Sodium-ion batteries]]** — large-scale availability by end of 2026
- Battery swapping, passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, energy storage applications

**LFP dominance:**
- Lower cost vs NMC
- No cobalt/nickel dependency
- Tesla Model 3/Y standard range use CATL LFP

## Global expansion

**Flagship of [[China]]'s outbound investment surge:**

| Project | Location | Investment | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Arnstadt** | [[Germany]] | **$2B** | 2,000 employees, growing |
| **Indonesia** | Karawang | **$6B** | Groundbreaking June 2025 |
| [[Stellantis]] JV | Spain | — | 50 GWh, 2026 |
| Hungary | Debrecen | — | 100 GWh, operating |

**[[Germany]] contrast (Jan 2026):**
- CATL Arnstadt: Expanding, hiring
- Ford Cologne: Cutting 1,000 jobs, single shift

**Indonesia:** Part of Chinese push to control EV battery supply chain from nickel refining to cell production.

See [[Capital flow reversal]] — CATL exemplifies [[China]] building factories abroad rather than buying trophy assets.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Unassailable market leadership
- Technology moat (LFP, sodium-ion)
- Tesla/VW/[[BMW]] locked in
- Energy storage growth (grid-scale)
- Vertical integration

**Bear:**
- [[China]] exposure (tariffs, geopolitics)
- Pricing pressure from BYD
- Western localization costs
- Overcapacity risk in [[China]]
