# AST SpaceMobile

Direct-to-cell satellite broadband company. Building "cell towers in the sky" — BlueBird satellites transmit 4G/5G directly to unmodified smartphones. Pre-revenue commercialization phase with massive carrier partnerships.

---

## Why it matters

Only pure-play direct-to-cell satellite company with carrier deals spanning ~3B subscribers globally. If the technology works at scale, it eliminates dead zones worldwide without requiring new handsets — a TAM measured in billions of unconnected people.

## Satellite constellation

### In orbit (as of Dec 2025)

| Satellite | Type | Array size | Status |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------|
| BlueWalker 3 | Test | 693 sq ft | Test platform |
| BlueBirds 1-5 | Block 1 | ~700 sq ft each | Operational |
| **BlueBird 6** | **Block 2** | **2,400 sq ft** | **Launched Dec 23, 2025** |

**Total in orbit: 7** (BlueWalker 3 + BlueBirds 1-6)

BlueBird 6 is the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in LEO. Peak data rates up to 120 Mbps to unmodified phones.

### 2026 launch schedule

- BlueBird 7 shipping to Florida, target late Feb 2026
- 4 additional launches planned before March 2026
- **Target: 45-60 satellites by end of 2026**
- 90 satellites needed for global continuous service
- 243 satellites planned by end of 2028 (FCC filing)

## Carrier partnerships

| Partner | Deal | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [[AT&T]] | Through 2030 | Beta service H1 2026, FirstNet, enterprise, IoT |
| [[Verizon]] | $100M investment (May 2024) | Continental US coverage, investor + strategic partner |
| Vodafone | Global | European markets |
| Rakuten | Japan | |
| stc Group | 10-year, $175M upfront | Saudi Arabia + MENA, 3 gateways + NOC in Riyadh |
| Vi (Vodafone Idea) | India | Direct-to-device |
| **50+ MNOs total** | ~3B subscribers | Global coverage |

Uses "a segment" of both AT&T and Verizon's 850 MHz spectrum for US coverage.

### Key technology milestones

- First native VoLTE voice calls over satellite on unmodified smartphones (AT&T network)
- Successful VoLTE calls on Verizon network via BlueBirds 1-5
- [[Google]] + AT&T partnership for Android satellite connectivity

---

## Government contracts

- US Missile Defense Agency SHIELD initiative contract
- FirstNet (AT&T's first responder network) integration planned

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| [[Starlink]] (T-Mobile) | Direct-to-cell add-on | Testing, limited bandwidth |
| [[Amazon]] LEO (AT&T) | Fixed broadband, **not** direct-to-cell | Launching 2026 |
| [[Globalstar]] (Apple) | Emergency SOS, not broadband D2D | Operational |

**Key differentiator:** Only company offering full broadband (voice, data, video) direct-to-cell from space. Starlink D2D limited to messaging/low bandwidth. Amazon LEO targets enterprise fixed broadband.

**Feb 2026 AT&T-Amazon LEO selloff:** ASTS dropped ~11% on Feb 4 when AT&T announced Amazon LEO partnership. AT&T clarified LEO deal is for enterprise fixed broadband — does not impact AST SpaceMobile plans. Different use cases.

## Risks

- **Execution risk** — scaling from 7 to 60+ satellites is unprecedented manufacturing/launch challenge
- **Cash burn** — $700M/year with $1.2B cash; will need additional capital
- **Valuation** — 778x P/S assumes massive future revenue that hasn't materialized
- **Technology risk** — consistent broadband from LEO to unmodified phones is unproven at scale
- **Competition** — Amazon, SpaceX have far deeper pockets
- **Spectrum dependency** — relies on carrier partners' spectrum allocations

## What to watch

- [ ] BlueBird 7 launch (late Feb 2026)
- [ ] AT&T beta service launch (H1 2026)
- [ ] Satellite production cadence toward 45-60 target
- [ ] Q4 2025 earnings — revenue trajectory
- [ ] Capital raise timing and dilution
