**Samsung Electronics** — vertically integrated conglomerate with foundry, memory, and display divisions.

## Core thesis

Samsung foundry is a high-variance, high-execution-risk bet on catching [[TSMC]]. The conglomerate structure provides patient capital but dilutes focus. Aggression may be rational given structural position.

![[samsung-vs-peers.png]]
*Samsung +10% since 2018 — massive underperformance vs [[Semiconductors|SMH]] (+330%). Foundry yields and memory cycle headwinds.*

*vs [[Semiconductors|SMH]]*

## Key concepts

- [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]] — \#2 position forces risk-taking
- [[Execution risk in foundries]] — Samsung's defining challenge
- [[Yield as competitive moat]] — the gap Samsung must close

## Key events

- **Lutnick 100% tariff threat** (Jan 17, 2026) — [[Howard Lutnick]] warns Korean memory makers face 100% tariffs unless they build in US. Samsung committed $40B+ US investment, including $17B Texas [[HBM]] packaging facility.
- [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] — the 4nm→2nm mid-construction leap

## Memory capacity expansion (Jan 2026)

**Samsung planning ~50% capacity expansion in 2026:**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Capacity increase | **~50%** for 2026 |
| Server DRAM pricing | Seeking **+70% price hikes** (with SK Hynix) |
| New fabs | P5 (Pyeongtaek) — operational 2028 |
| Stargate commitment | 900K DRAM wafers/month (with SK Hynix) |
| HBM4 production | **February 2026** (with SK Hynix) |

**Supercycle context:** BoA calls this a "supercycle similar to 1990s boom" — DRAM revenue +51%, NAND +45% YoY. Global semi market heading to $975B-$1T (+26-30%). [[IDC]] warns shortage may persist through 2027.

**P5 facility (Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi):**
- Under construction
- Expected operational: 2028
- Focus: Advanced memory for AI

**Context:** Korea back to \#2 in global chip equipment spending ($29.66B, +27.2% YoY).

## Open questions

- [[Can Samsung ever catch TSMC]]
- [[What happens if Taiwan is disrupted]] — potential beneficiary

## Structural advantages

- Cross-subsidy from memory/display divisions
- Patient capital — can absorb foundry losses for years
- Vertical integration — potential [[HBM]]/AI synergies

## Structural constraints

- Persistent yield gap vs TSMC
- Customer trust deficit
- Conglomerate complexity
- [[IP leakage risk]] — DRAM secrets leaked to [[China]]'s [[CXMT]] (Dec 2025)

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Foundry share | **6.8%** (Q3 2025) |
| Leading edge | 2nm targeting July 2026 (Taylor) |
| 2nm yields | **55-60%** (Dec 2025, up from 40%) |
| Taylor construction | **93.6% complete** |
| Taylor capacity | **50K wafers/month** (up from 20K) |
| Taylor investment | $44-50B (expanded from $17B) |
| [[CHIPS Act]] | $6.4B |
| Q4 2025 operating profit | **KRW 20T+ (~$14B)**, 30% above consensus |

*Updated 2026-02-12*

## Market expectations

What consensus assumes (update when you see estimates):

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2nm yields | Stay below TSMC | |
| Taylor timeline | Delayed to 2027 | |
| Major customer win | Low probability | |
| Foundry profitability | Negative near-term | |

**Priced in:**
- Continued yield struggles
- No major customer wins
- TSMC dominance continues

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- **AMD deal close** — reportedly nearing SF2P (2nm) deal for EPYC Venice server CPUs (TrendForce, Dec 2025). Would establish AMD dual-foundry strategy
- **[[NVIDIA]] second foundry** — After [[Groq]] licensing deal, industry sources say [[NVIDIA]] exploring Samsung as backup to TSMC (Dec 2025)
- ~~Yields improve faster than expected~~ **CONFIRMED: 55-60% (Dec 2025)**
- [[Taiwan]] disruption revalues Samsung capacity
- **TSMC overflow customers** — Google, [[Qualcomm]], AMD, Amazon exploring Samsung (Jan 2026)
- **Exynos 2600** — World's first 2nm mobile chip (Galaxy S26), proof point for 2nm viability

## Turnkey bundle strategy (Jan 2026)

**Samsung offering integrated solution to hyperscalers:**

| Component | Samsung offering |
|-----------|------------------|
| Foundry | SF2 (2nm) process |
| [[Advanced packaging]] | CoWoS alternative |
| Memory | [[HBM]] from Samsung |
| Integration | Single vendor, Texas facilities |

**[[Target]] customers:**

| Customer | Product | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [[Google]] | TPU packaging | Exploring |
| [[AMD]] | GPU/CPU | Exploring |
| [[Amazon]] | Custom chips | Exploring |

**Why "turnkey" matters:** TSMC doesn't make memory. Samsung can bundle foundry + packaging + [[HBM]] as one-stop solution — differentiation vs TSMC's logic-only approach.

**Recently confirmed:**
- **[[xAI]] Taylor deal finalized** (Dec 2025) — Custom AI chips, production early 2026, full scale 2027
- **Q4 2025 beat** — 30% above consensus, memory + foundry both contributing
- **Yields approaching TSMC** — 55-60% vs TSMC ~65%

*Multiple catalysts materializing. Thesis strengthening.*

## [[Consumer]] electronics / Display ([[CES 2026]])

**Samsung is also world's \#1 TV maker.** Non-semiconductor revenue diversification:

**Micro RGB technology (Jan 2026):**
- New LCD backlighting tech — individual R/G/B backlights vs white/blue
- Improves color accuracy vs standard LCD
- 115-inch Micro RGB TV at $30,000
- Expanding to 55-130 inch range

**OLED competition with LG:**
- S95H flagship: 35% brighter than prior gen
- S90H: Added glare-free screen, 15% brighter
- "Quantum dot" OLED panels from Samsung Display
- Re-entered OLED in 2022 after years of LCD-only

**AI integration:**
- Compatible with Bixby, [[Microsoft]], [[Perplexity]] [[AI agents]]
- AI Sound Controller for dialogue/music/effects adjustment
- Automatic picture/sound optimization

**Market trend:** "Super big screens" (98-130 inch) fastest-growing TV segment, expected to double in 2026.

## Q4 FY2025 earnings (reported Jan 2026)

| Metric | Q4 FY2025 | YoY |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Revenue | ₩93.8T | +24% |
| Device Solutions | ₩44.0T | +46% |
| Memory | ₩37.1T | +62% |

Foundry began mass production of first-gen 2nm products and shipped 4nm [[HBM]] base-die.

## Foundry recovery (Feb 2026)

Samsung foundry entering a significant recovery phase:

| Development | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **AMD EPYC Venice** | Reportedly nearing SF2P (2nm) deal — dual-foundry with [[TSMC]] |
| **Apple CIS deal** | Manufacturing iPhone camera sensors at Austin, TX — breaking [[Sony]] exclusivity. SemiAnalysis: 20-30% of Apple CIS volume by 2027 ($1-1.5B/yr) |
| **2nm pricing** | Wafer price reportedly cut to $20K — **undercutting [[TSMC]] by 33%** |
| **TSMC overflow** | Rising TSMC prices + capacity constraints making Samsung increasingly attractive |
| **Taylor, TX fab** | On track for 2026 opening, ~1,500 permanent employees by year-end. $17B — largest single foreign investment in Texas. [[Tesla]] as anchor client through 2033 |

**Galaxy S26 Unpacked (Feb 25, 2026):** S26 Ultra with Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, privacy display. New Bixby AI assistant with [[Perplexity]] integration. Galaxy S26 Edge cancelled, S26 Plus revived.

## HBM supply locks

Samsung has locked multi-year [[HBM]] supply deals with AI hyperscalers, guaranteeing volume at favorable pricing:

| Customer | Product | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | HBM3E/HBM4 | Multi-year agreement |
| AI hyperscalers | HBM for accelerators | Capacity committed |
| [[Project Stargate]] | 900K wafers/month (with [[SK Hynix]]) | Committed |

This contributes to [[HBM economics]] — consumer DRAM getting squeezed as capacity shifts to HBM. See [[Memory squeeze thesis]].

### HBM4 pricing (Feb 27, 2026)

Samsung negotiating **~$700/unit** for HBM4 — **30% above** previous generation (Chosun Ilbo). Stock hit fresh record high (+5.4%).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HBM4 unit price | **~$700** (Samsung) |
| vs HBM3E | +30% |
| Operating margin | **50-60%** (Bloomberg Intelligence, Masahiro Wakasugi) |
| [[SK Hynix]] HBM4 price | Mid-$500s (set Aug 2025 for [[NVIDIA]]) — may raise to match |
| Samsung HBM4 status | Mass production started, commercial shipments underway |

Bloomberg Intelligence: "The gap between ASPs for Samsung and [[SK Hynix]] will be smaller in 2026 if Samsung supplies more HBM chips to [[NVIDIA]], as those prices should be higher than for other customers."

Samsung regaining pricing leverage at the premium end after initially falling behind [[SK Hynix]] in HBM. Saxo Markets (Charu Chanana): "sign that the AI memory market is still tight."

**Korea market context:** Kospi **+34% YTD** — world's best-performing stock market, driven by [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory shortage]] tailwind.
