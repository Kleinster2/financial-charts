**Samsung Electronics** — vertically integrated conglomerate with foundry, memory, and display divisions.

## Core thesis

Samsung foundry is a high-variance, high-execution-risk bet on catching [[TSMC]]. The conglomerate structure provides patient capital but dilutes focus. Aggression may be rational given structural position.

## Key concepts

- [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]] — #2 position forces risk-taking
- [[Execution risk in foundries]] — Samsung's defining challenge
- [[Yield as competitive moat]] — the gap Samsung must close

## Key events

- **Lutnick 100% tariff threat** (Jan 17, 2026) — [[Howard Lutnick]] warns Korean memory makers face 100% tariffs unless they build in US. Samsung committed $40B+ US investment, including $17B Texas HBM packaging facility.
- [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] — the 4nm→2nm mid-construction leap

## Open questions

- [[Can Samsung ever catch TSMC]]
- [[What happens if Taiwan is disrupted]] — potential beneficiary

## Structural advantages

- Cross-subsidy from memory/display divisions
- Patient capital — can absorb foundry losses for years
- Vertical integration — potential HBM/AI synergies

## Structural constraints

- Persistent yield gap vs TSMC
- Customer trust deficit
- Conglomerate complexity
- [[IP leakage risk]] — DRAM secrets leaked to China's CXMT (Dec 2025)

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Foundry share | **6.8%** (Q3 2025) |
| Leading edge | 2nm targeting July 2026 (Taylor) |
| 2nm yields | **55-60%** (Dec 2025, up from 40%) |
| Taylor construction | **93.6% complete** |
| Taylor capacity | **50K wafers/month** (up from 20K) |
| Taylor investment | $44-50B (expanded from $17B) |
| CHIPS Act | $6.4B |
| Q4 2025 operating profit | **KRW 20T+ (~$14B)**, 30% above consensus |

## Market expectations

What consensus assumes (update when you see estimates):

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2nm yields | Stay below TSMC | |
| Taylor timeline | Delayed to 2027 | |
| Major customer win | Low probability | |
| Foundry profitability | Negative near-term | |

**Priced in:**
- Continued yield struggles
- No major customer wins
- TSMC dominance continues

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- AMD deal closes (Jan 2026 decision)
- **NVIDIA second foundry** — After Groq licensing deal, industry sources say NVIDIA exploring Samsung as backup to TSMC (Dec 2025)
- ~~Yields improve faster than expected~~ **CONFIRMED: 55-60% (Dec 2025)**
- Taiwan disruption revalues Samsung capacity
- **TSMC overflow customers** — Google, Qualcomm, AMD, Amazon exploring Samsung (Jan 2026)
- **Exynos 2600** — World's first 2nm mobile chip (Galaxy S26), proof point for 2nm viability

## Turnkey bundle strategy (Jan 2026)

**Samsung offering integrated solution to hyperscalers:**

| Component | Samsung offering |
|-----------|------------------|
| Foundry | SF2 (2nm) process |
| Advanced packaging | CoWoS alternative |
| Memory | HBM from Samsung |
| Integration | Single vendor, Texas facilities |

**Target customers:**

| Customer | Product | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [[Google]] | TPU packaging | Exploring |
| [[AMD]] | GPU/CPU | Exploring |
| [[Amazon]] | Custom chips | Exploring |

**Why "turnkey" matters:** TSMC doesn't make memory. Samsung can bundle foundry + packaging + HBM as one-stop solution — differentiation vs TSMC's logic-only approach.

**Recently confirmed:**
- **xAI Taylor deal finalized** (Dec 2025) — Custom AI chips, production early 2026, full scale 2027
- **Q4 2025 beat** — 30% above consensus, memory + foundry both contributing
- **Yields approaching TSMC** — 55-60% vs TSMC ~65%

*Multiple catalysts materializing. Thesis strengthening.*

## Consumer electronics / Display (CES 2026)

**Samsung is also world's #1 TV maker.** Non-semiconductor revenue diversification:

**Micro RGB technology (Jan 2026):**
- New LCD backlighting tech — individual R/G/B backlights vs white/blue
- Improves color accuracy vs standard LCD
- 115-inch Micro RGB TV at $30,000
- Expanding to 55-130 inch range

**OLED competition with LG:**
- S95H flagship: 35% brighter than prior gen
- S90H: Added glare-free screen, 15% brighter
- "Quantum dot" OLED panels from Samsung Display
- Re-entered OLED in 2022 after years of LCD-only

**AI integration:**
- Compatible with Bixby, Microsoft, [[Perplexity]] AI agents
- AI Sound Controller for dialogue/music/effects adjustment
- Automatic picture/sound optimization

**Market trend:** "Super big screens" (98-130 inch) fastest-growing TV segment, expected to double in 2026.

## For theses

- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — foundry upside from low expectations
- [[Long memory]] — memory margins fund foundry bets, shortage tailwind
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — more chips = more test demand
