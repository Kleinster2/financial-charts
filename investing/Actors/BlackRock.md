## Week of Feb 24-27, 2026

### TCPC dividend cut — private credit stress signal

BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC), a publicly traded BDC (business development company) managed by BlackRock, **slashed its dividend 32%** from $0.25 → $0.17/share.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q4 2025 NII | $0.26/share |
| New dividend | **$0.17/share** (-32%) |
| Net regulatory leverage | **1.41×** (elevated) |
| Non-accruals | Rising — soured loans pressuring results |
| Realized + unrealized losses | Significant |
| Stock | Slumped on announcement |

**Why it matters:** This is [[Private credit]] stress showing up in public markets. Declining rates compressed NII while loan losses mounted. TCPC is a canary for the broader private credit complex — if BlackRock's own BDC is cutting dividends, weaker BDCs are in deeper trouble. Connects to [[Treasury safe asset erosion|credit market echoes]].

### JGBs as safe asset alternative — "Golden Age"

BlackRock called the current backdrop a **"golden age"** for investing in Japanese government bonds. Dollar-hedged JGBs can offer ~**6% yield** for US investors willing to take duration risk on long-dated [[Japan]] sovereign debt.

**The subtext:** If the world's largest asset manager is publicly steering clients toward JGBs over Treasuries, that's a signal on relative safe asset attractiveness. Supports the [[Treasury safe asset erosion]] thesis — capital is being actively redirected away from Treasuries toward alternative sovereign debt.

### Kuwait Petroleum pipeline — $7B infrastructure deal

KPC (Kuwait Petroleum Corp) held early-stage talks with **BlackRock, [[Brookfield]], EIG Partners, and [[KKR]]** over a **$7B stake sale** in its crude oil pipeline network.

- Deal structure: ~$1.5B equity, remainder financed by debt
- Fits BlackRock's GIP-powered infrastructure push
- Gulf sovereign monetization trend continues (after Saudi Aramco pipeline deals)

### IBIT Bitcoin accumulation

iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) received **4,309 BTC (~$289M)** from Coinbase Prime in under an hour on Feb 26. Part of **$507M total** US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows that day.

### UBS upgrade

UBS upgraded BLK stock, citing evolving profit engine across ETFs + private markets + Aladdin platform revenue.

---

## Altice exposure

**Altice France:** BlackRock, Fidelity, and PIMCO took 45% equity stake in Feb 2025 restructuring that wiped €8.6B debt. [[Patrick Drahi]] retained 55% control.

**Altice USA:** Sued by [[Altice]] (now Optimum) alongside [[Apollo]] and [[Ares Management]] in late 2025, alleging "illegal cartel" among lenders holding majority of $26B debt.
