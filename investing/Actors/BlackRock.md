## Week of Feb 24-27, 2026

### TCPC dividend cut — private credit stress signal

BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC), a publicly traded BDC (business development company) managed by BlackRock, **slashed its dividend 32%** from $0.25 → $0.17/share.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q4 2025 NII | $0.26/share |
| New dividend | **$0.17/share** (-32% from $0.25) |
| Stock reaction | **-8.7%** intraday |
| NAV cut (Jan 2026) | **-19%** — sent shares tumbling |
| Net regulatory leverage | **1.41×** (elevated) |
| New investment yield | **9.7%** (Q4 new deployments) |
| Exited investment yield | **11.1%** (negative yield migration) |
| Key exposure losses | E-commerce aggregators (Amazon seller roll-ups), **Renovo Home Partners** (filed bankruptcy) |

TCPC is a middle-market lending fund. Statement: "The company's highest near-term priority is to improve portfolio credit quality by working diligently to resolve challenged credits."

**Declining rates are a double squeeze:** New investments yielding 9.7% vs 11.1% for exits — every dollar redeployed earns less. Meanwhile soured loans eat into the shrinking income.

**Not isolated — BDC-wide stress:**
- **Blue Owl Capital** halted quarterly withdrawals from one of its retail funds (same week)
- **Future Standard / [[KKR]]** jointly managed BDC also plunged Thursday after cutting dividend more than forecast — same dynamics (lower rates + troubled investments)

**Why it matters:** This is [[Private credit]] stress showing up in public markets. If BlackRock's own BDC is cutting dividends 32%, weaker BDCs are in deeper trouble. The Amazon seller roll-up exposure is particularly telling — these are exactly the kind of leveraged, low-quality borrowers that thrived in the easy money era and are now unraveling. Connects to [[Treasury safe asset erosion|credit market echoes]].

### JGBs as safe asset alternative — "Golden Age"

**Navin Saigal** (BlackRock head of global fixed income, Asia Pacific) on Bloomberg TV called the current backdrop a **"golden age"** for investing in Japanese government bonds.

| Maturity | JGB yield (unhedged) | Dollar-hedged yield | vs Treasury pickup |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 20-year | ~4% | **~6.06%** | **+140bps** over comparable Treasury |
| 30-year | ~4% | **~6%+** | **+175bps** over comparable Treasury |

**The trade:** ~4% from JGB coupon + ~2% FX hedge pickup (lending dollars, receiving yen). PIMCO also highlighting this.

*30Y JGB FX-hedged (orange) vs Treasuries (white) vs JGB unhedged (gray). Since 2022, hedged JGBs have consistently yielded more than Treasuries. Source: Bloomberg.*

**Risks:**
- Long-dated JGBs are illiquid and volatile — 20Y and 30Y spiked last month on fears PM Takaichi would ramp fiscal spending, wiping out **$41B** from the bond market
- Currency-hedged JGB returns (20Y+) fell **>15% last year** — worst in a decade
- Japan still has **negative real yields** — so the real return story depends on the FX hedge holding
- Saigal himself caveatted: "opportunistic trades" not core portfolio allocation; position smaller to control volatility

**The subtext:** If the world's largest asset manager is publicly steering clients toward JGBs over Treasuries, that's a signal on relative safe asset attractiveness. Supports the [[Treasury safe asset erosion]] thesis — capital is being actively redirected away from Treasuries toward alternative sovereign debt.

### Kuwait Petroleum pipeline — $7B infrastructure deal

KPC (Kuwait Petroleum Corp) held early-stage talks with **BlackRock, [[Brookfield]], EIG Partners, and [[KKR]]** over a **$7B stake sale** in its crude oil pipeline network.

- Deal structure: ~$1.5B equity, remainder financed by debt
- Fits BlackRock's GIP-powered infrastructure push
- Gulf sovereign monetization trend continues (after Saudi Aramco pipeline deals)

### IBIT Bitcoin accumulation

iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) received **4,309 BTC (~$289M)** from Coinbase Prime in under an hour on Feb 26. Part of **$507M total** US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows that day.

### UBS upgrade

UBS upgraded BLK stock, citing evolving profit engine across ETFs + private markets + Aladdin platform revenue.

## Altice exposure

**Altice France:** BlackRock, Fidelity, and PIMCO took 45% equity stake in Feb 2025 restructuring that wiped €8.6B debt. [[Patrick Drahi]] retained 55% control.

**Altice USA:** Sued by [[Altice]] (now Optimum) alongside [[Apollo]] and [[Ares Management]] in late 2025, alleging "illegal cartel" among lenders holding majority of $26B debt.
