## Why 1X matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2014 (as Halodi Robotics) |
| HQ | Palo Alto, CA (since July 2025) |
| Manufacturing | Norway |
| Valuation | $480M (Series B, Jan 2024) |
| Reported target | $10B+ (seeking up to $1B, Sep 2025, unconfirmed) |
| Total raised | $125M+ |
| Robots | EVE (wheeled), NEO (bipedal) |

---

## OpenAI investment

[[OpenAI]] led the Series A2 ($23.5M, 2023) — their direct robotics bet. Also backs [[Figure AI]], hedging across form factors. Potential for [[ChatGPT]] integration in embodied AI.

---

## Robot portfolio

| Robot | Type | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| EVE | Wheeled humanoid | Security, retail |
| NEO | Bipedal humanoid | [[Home]], consumer |

---

## EVE

Wheeled humanoid — already deployed and revenue-generating. Security/patrol use case. ADT partnership.

---

## NEO

Pre-orders opened Oct 2025 (CES 2026 showcase). Company said pre-orders "far exceeded" goals.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Weight | 66 lbs (30 kg) |
| Lift capacity | 150 lbs |
| Carry capacity | 55 lbs |
| Hands | 22 DOF (human-level dexterity) |
| Noise | 22 dB (quieter than refrigerator) |
| Body | Custom 3D lattice polymer (soft) |
| AI | [[OpenAI]] customized model + Redwood AI |

Pricing: $20,000 (Early Access) or $499/month subscription ([[Robots as a Service|RaaS]]).

Delivery timeline:
- Q3-Q4 2026: US and Canada (Early Access buyers first)
- 2027: Global expansion

NEO is not fully autonomous at launch — requires [[Teleoperation as data collection|teleoperator support]] for complex tasks. Buyers should expect a capable but developing platform that improves via software updates.

[[EQT]] deal (Dec 2025): Up to 10,000 NEO robots to [[EQT]]'s 300+ portfolio companies (2026-2030) for manufacturing, warehousing, logistics.

---

## HQ relocation

July 2025: Relocated global headquarters from Norway to Palo Alto to access Silicon Valley talent and investor networks. Manufacturing operations remain in Norway. The move reflects the gravitational pull of the US robotics/AI ecosystem — same dynamic pulling [[Unitree]] and others toward US presence.

## Business model

| Product | Model |
|---------|-------|
| EVE | Lease to enterprises |
| NEO | $20K purchase or $499/mo [[Robots as a Service|RaaS]] subscription |

---

## Competition

| Competitor | 1X vs |
|------------|-------|
| [[Figure AI]] | OpenAI backs both |
| [[Tesla]] Optimus | Different market |
| [[Agility Robotics]] | B2B focused |

OpenAI hedging with multiple robotics bets.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- [[OpenAI]] strategic backing
- EVE already commercial, revenue-generating
- Consumer humanoid first mover (NEO pre-orders exceed expectations)
- [[EQT]] deal provides industrial demand pipeline (10,000 units)
- Potential $10B+ valuation jump from $480M

Bear:
- Massively outfunded by [[Figure AI]] ($2.3B+) and [[Apptronik]] ($935M)
- Consumer robotics historically difficult market
- NEO requires teleoperator support at launch — not fully autonomous
- [[OpenAI]] backs [[Figure AI]] too
