## AI disintermediation fears (Feb 2026)

Stock sold off alongside US wealth managers ([[Charles Schwab]], [[Raymond James]], [[LPL Financial]]) following the [[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]]. SJP's face-to-face advisory model is exactly what [[AI disintermediation]] targets.

Counter-thesis: UK regulatory moat (FCA-licensed advisers), relationship complexity, high retention (94.9%), and strong FY2025 results (inflows +19%, profits +40%) suggest the selloff is overblown. Raymond James analyst: "completely overblown — people just want to trust their money with somebody."

Analyst consensus: 9 Buy, 0 Sell.
