## Galliano era (2014-2024)

**The rehabilitation:** Galliano was hired three years after his 2011 dismissal from [[Dior]] following antisemitic remarks. Margiela offered a path back through a house known for anonymity.

**Results:**
- Revenue: ~€100M (2014) → ~$500M (2024)
- Store count: ~50 → ~120 globally
- Growth: 23% in 2023, 4.6% in 2024
- Made Margiela commercially viable while preserving avant-garde identity

**Departure:** Left amicably in late 2024. Glenn Martens now leads both Margiela and [[Diesel]].

## Financials

Part of [[OTB]] group (also owns [[Diesel]], [[Jil Sander]], [[Viktor & Rolf]]).

| Year | OTB Revenue | Margiela notes |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 2023 | €1.9B | Margiela +23% (fastest growing) |
| 2024 | €1.8B | Margiela +4.6% |

Margiela is OTB's luxury anchor — higher margins than [[Diesel]], growing faster.

## Bellini era (~2017-2021)

[[Riccardo Bellini]] as CEO:
- Stabilized operations during Galliano's rocky early years
- Doubled revenue during tenure
- Expanded retail footprint
- Departed for [[Chloé]] CEO role

---

## Brand identity

**Founder's vision:** Martin Margiela pioneered deconstructionism — exposed seams, recycled materials, anonymous shows (models' faces often obscured). Never gave interviews, never photographed.

**Signature:** Tabi boots (split-toe), white lab coats, numbered labels (0-23 line system), blank white tags

**Position:** Intellectual fashion — appeals to industry insiders, creative class. Not mass market.
