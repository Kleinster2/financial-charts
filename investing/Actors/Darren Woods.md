## Venezuela position

**Strongly skeptical on return; deems Venezuela "uninvestable":**

At [[WH oil executives Venezuela meeting 2026-01-09]], Woods articulated Exxon's deep reservations:

> "You can imagine to re-enter [Venezuela] a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here and what is currently the state."
>
> He further stated that Venezuela was **"uninvestable"** given the current legal and commercial frameworks.

**Context:** Exxon exited Venezuela in 2007 after refusing Chavez nationalization terms. Won $1.6B arbitration (sought $12B). Would be "third time" entering if they return.
