**Teradyne** — Semiconductor test equipment and industrial robotics. Benefits from AI chip complexity driving test demand.

---

## Why Teradyne matters

Test equipment is a picks-and-shovels play on semiconductor complexity:

| Segment | Description | % Revenue |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Semiconductor Test | ATE for chips | ~75% |
| Industrial Automation | Collaborative robots (Universal Robots) | ~15% |
| System Test | Board/storage test | ~10% |

As chips get more complex (AI accelerators, HBM, advanced packaging), test time and cost increase.

## Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 2, 2026)

**Beat + massive Q1 guidance. Stock +22%.**

| Metric | Q4 actual | Q1 guidance |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Revenue | $1.08B (+44% YoY) | $1.15-1.25B |
| EPS (non-GAAP) | $1.80 | $1.89-2.25 |
| EPS (GAAP) | $1.82-2.19 | — |

**Q1 guidance 26% above consensus** — strongest outlook in years.

CEO Greg Smith: "In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI."

## Business segments

### Semiconductor Test (~75%)

**Automatic Test Equipment (ATE):**
- Tests chips during manufacturing
- Higher complexity = more test time = higher ASP
- AI accelerators require extensive testing
- Memory test benefits from HBM ramp

**Key customers:** [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]], [[Qualcomm]], memory makers

### Industrial Automation (~15%)

**Universal Robots (acquired 2015):**
- Collaborative robots ("cobots")
- Factory automation
- Growing with reshoring trend

### Robotics momentum

The Q1 guidance surge partly reflects robotics demand. AI-driven automation investment accelerating.

## AI exposure

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| AI accelerators | Complex chips need more test time |
| HBM testing | Memory test demand surge |
| Advanced packaging | CoWoS, chiplets need system-level test |
| Edge AI | Proliferation of AI chips |

Teradyne is a second-derivative AI play — doesn't make AI chips but benefits from their complexity.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| **Advantest** | Primary competitor, strong in memory |
| **Cohu** | Smaller, handler focus |

Teradyne and Advantest dominate semiconductor ATE market.

## Zacks top AI stock (Feb 2026)

Ranked #2 on Zacks "Best AI Stocks to Buy" list (updated Feb 16, 2026):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $314.82 |
| Forward P/E | 51.69 |
| 12-week price change | +82.2% |
| Proj EPS growth (1Y) | +49.3% |
| Proj sales growth (1Y) | +28.5% |

Strongest 12-week momentum of the five picks. AI chip complexity = more test steps per device.
