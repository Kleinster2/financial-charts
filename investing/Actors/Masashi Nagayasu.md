# Masashi Nagayasu

CEO of [[Panasonic Automotive]], leading the company's transformation after its 2024 carve-out from [[Panasonic]] Holdings to [[Apollo]]. 42-year [[Panasonic]] veteran. Focused on shifting from traditional auto electronics to personalized mobility experiences.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | CEO, Panasonic Automotive |
| Tenure at Panasonic | 42 years |
| Owner | [[Apollo]] (majority) |
| Key target | Triple E-C (EBITDA - CAPEX) by 2027 vs 2024 |

## Leadership approach

Describes Apollo's style as "discipline" — takes it positively. Fewer Panasonic group constraints allows full focus on automotive. Short-term and midterm targets tracking ahead of plan since Apollo partnership began.

Acknowledges some employee resistance to the name change (moving away from Panasonic brand) — initial response "not very positive, frankly." Strategy: show results first, then mindsets follow.

Maintains [[Kōnosuke Matsushita]]'s founding philosophy as the company's "backbone" — this won't change, but everything else can.

## Strategic priorities

- Automotive mobility experience ("joy in motion") over traditional driving performance
- AI-enhanced personalization (temperature, comfort, entertainment)
- Startup partnerships across the automotive ecosystem
- Global customer engagement
