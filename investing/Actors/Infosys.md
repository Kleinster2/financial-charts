## February 2026: Claude Cowork selloff

**Feb 3-4, 2026:** Stock fell **-7.4%** on [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork launch]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Two-day decline | -7.4% |
| Catalyst | Claude Cowork automation of services workflows |

**Disruption thesis:** Indian IT services margins depend on labor arbitrage — delivering work cheaper via offshore talent. AI agents that automate the same workflows eliminate the arbitrage entirely.

**Exposed segments:**
- Application maintenance
- Business process outsourcing
- Testing/QA
- Basic consulting

**Bull case:** Complex enterprise transformations still need human judgment. Infosys can pivot to AI implementation services.

## February 2026: Anthropic enterprise partnership

At the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]] (Feb 16–20), [[Infosys]] announced a partnership with [[Anthropic]] to deploy [[Claude]] models and [[Claude Code]] for Indian enterprises. Starts in telecom, expanding to **financial services, manufacturing, and software development**. Includes a dedicated **Anthropic Center of Excellence** within [[Infosys]].

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Partner | [[Anthropic]] |
| Products | [[Claude]], [[Claude Code]] |
| Initial sector | Telecom |
| Expansion sectors | Financial services, manufacturing, software development |
| Structure | Anthropic Center of Excellence |
| Agent use cases | Claims processing, code gen/testing, compliance reviews |

[[Dario Amodei]]: "Infosys has exactly that kind of expertise across important industries." CEO [[Salil Parekh]]: "Our collaboration with Anthropic marks a strategic leap toward advancing enterprise AI."

Stock rose **+2.8%** on the announcement, outperforming Indian IT peers — though still **-17% month-to-date** from [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|AI disruption fears]].

**Strategic read:** Five weeks after [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork]] triggered a -7.4% two-day selloff on fears that AI agents would automate Indian IT's labor-arbitrage model, Infosys announces a major partnership with the same company whose product caused the panic. The pivot: from *doing the work* to *implementing the AI that does the work*. Infosys becomes Anthropic's distribution channel into regulated enterprises, using domain expertise and client relationships as the moat instead of cheap labor. The open question is whether margins on "AI implementation services" approach the margins on having 300K people doing the work directly.
