## February 2026: Claude Cowork selloff

**Feb 3-4, 2026:** Stock fell **-7.4%** on [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork launch]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Two-day decline | -7.4% |
| Catalyst | Claude Cowork automation of services workflows |

**Disruption thesis:** Indian IT services margins depend on labor arbitrage — delivering work cheaper via offshore talent. AI agents that automate the same workflows eliminate the arbitrage entirely.

**Exposed segments:**
- Application maintenance
- Business process outsourcing
- Testing/QA
- Basic consulting

**Bull case:** Complex enterprise transformations still need human judgment. Infosys can pivot to AI implementation services.
