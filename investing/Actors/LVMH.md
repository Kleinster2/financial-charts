## Louis Vuitton

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | ~€25B (est.) |
| Operating margin | ~45% (best in luxury) |
| Status | Crown jewel |
| Pricing power | Never discounts |

Louis Vuitton alone is likely worth more than LVMH's entire market cap. Exceptional brand protection — no outlets, no sales, controlled distribution.

**YTD performance**: Down ~15% on tariff concerns, China weakness

---

## [[China]] exposure

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue share | ~25-30% of sales |
| Recovery | Slower than expected |
| Consumer shift | Trading down, domestic brands gaining |

China was the luxury growth engine 2015-2021. Now headwind — consumer confidence weak, property crisis, Xi's "common prosperity" rhetoric.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Louis Vuitton pricing power unmatched
- Brand portfolio depth (75+ brands)
- Wealth creation tailwind (global HNWI growth)
- [[Tiffany]] integration complete
- [[Sephora]] strength in Selective Retailing
- [[Bernard Arnault]] operational excellence

**Bear:**
- [[China]] slowdown persisting
- Luxury normalization post-COVID boom
- Aspirational consumer weakness
- Wine & Spirits drag (cognac exposure)
- Valuation premium to peers
- Succession uncertainty (Arnault is 75)

## Competitive position

| vs | LVMH strength | LVMH weakness |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| [[Hermès]] | Portfolio breadth, M&A capability | Lower margins, less scarcity |
| [[Richemont]] | Fashion dominance | Weaker in hard luxury (jewelry/watches) |
| [[Kering]] | Better management, diversification | Less exposure to Gucci upside |
