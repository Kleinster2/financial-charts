## GameStop systemic risk warning (Jan 2026)

Peterffy gave the most detailed account yet of how close the financial system came to collapse in Jan 2021. IBKR customers had bought [[GameStop]] on margin at low prices; those shares were loaned to short sellers. If margin customers sold a fraction to pay back loans, brokers would have been forced to recall shares — but SI exceeded total float.

"Wall Street would have collapsed... we were really, really shaking in our pants." The system was saved because retail investors held rather than sold — "I didn't know that these people didn't know what the rules were."

**The vulnerabilities remain unpatched** as of Jan 2026. IBKR has proposed:

| Proposal | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Daily SI publication | Real-time short interest transparency |
| Rising margin on SI | Maintenance margin increases above 50% SI |
| Position limits at 100% SI | No new shorts when SI hits 100% |

None adopted by regulators.

Peterffy also notes: "The customer base is becoming much more sophisticated. People certainly learned a lot about the market."
