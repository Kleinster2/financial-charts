## Career at Athene

| Period | Role |
|--------|------|
| Jan 2011 | Joined as CFO |
| ~2018 | Became President (US operations + growth initiatives) |
| Jul 2025 | Appointed CEO |

Kvalheim was the operational leader running Athene's day-to-day US business while [[Jim Belardi]] focused on investment strategy and overall direction. His promotion signals Athene's shift from startup-era founder leadership to institutional management for the next growth phase.

## Strategic context

The CEO transition aligns with Athene's five-year growth plan announced at the 2024 investor day:
- Scale from $430B toward $600B+ in assets
- Expand [[Japan]]/[[Asia]] operations (FCA Re sidecar with [[Fortitude Re]])
- Deepen defined contribution market (ARS acquisition with [[Apollo]])
- Maintain \#1 US individual annuity market position

Kvalheim told Semafor he's in a hurry — the retirement savings gap ($4T US, $51T global) represents a generational opportunity, and Athene's scale + Apollo asset management = structural competitive advantage.
