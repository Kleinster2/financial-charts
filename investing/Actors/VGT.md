Vanguard Information Technology ETF — tracks the MSCI US IMI/Information Technology 25/50 index. Broader than [[XLK]]: covers large, mid, and small-cap US tech (~320 holdings vs XLK's ~64). The largest tech ETF by AUM.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | ~$110B |
| Expense ratio | 0.09% |
| Holdings | ~320 |
| P/E | ~25x |
| Yield | 0.4% |

## Top Holdings

| Company | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| [[Apple]] | ~17% |
| [[NVIDIA]] | ~15% |
| [[Microsoft]] | ~13% |
| [[Broadcom]] | ~5% |
| [[Salesforce]] | ~3% |

Top 3 = ~45%. Less concentrated than [[XLK]] (~60%) due to the 25/50 capping rule inherited from the index methodology. Same mega-cap names dominate, but mid/small-cap tail adds ~250 more holdings.

## VGT vs XLK

Both are US tech sector ETFs. Key differences:

| | VGT | [[XLK]] |
|---|---|---|
| Index | MSCI US IMI IT 25/50 | S&P 500 Tech Select |
| Universe | All-cap (~320) | Large-cap only (~64) |
| Concentration | Top 3 ~45% | Top 3 ~60% |
| Expense | 0.09% | 0.08% |

VGT's broader universe gives more mid/small-cap exposure but performance tracks XLK closely since mega-caps dominate both.
