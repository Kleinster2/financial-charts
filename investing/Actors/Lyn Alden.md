## Career Arc

Lyn Alden's path is unusual for a macro analyst. She began her career as an electrical engineer in the aviation/defense industry, eventually moving into engineering management and corporate finance. In 2016, she founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, initially writing for retail investors on [[Seeking Alpha]] before building a large independent following.

She rose to prominence during 2019-2021 through deep-dive articles on [[fiscal deficits]], [[liquidity cycles]], and the structural challenges facing [[US Treasury|US government debt]]. Her engineering background gives her analysis a quantitative, systems-thinking flavor that distinguishes her from traditional macro commentators.

By the early 2020s she had become one of the most widely followed independent macro voices, regularly appearing on podcasts like [[MacroVoices]], [[Real Vision]], and [[The Investor's Podcast]]. She is also a prominent [[Bitcoin]] advocate and speaker at the [[Bitcoin Conference]].

## Key Theses & Frameworks

### Fiscal Dominance / "Nothing Stops This Train"
Her signature thesis argues the US has entered an era of [[fiscal dominance]] where [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] policy is subordinated to Treasury financing needs. Structural deficits driven by debt, demographics, and entitlements mean the government cannot tolerate sustained high real rates. The "train" of fiscal spending and debt growth is politically unstoppable regardless of party.

### Dollar Milkshake Counter-Thesis
While [[Brent Johnson]]'s [[dollar milkshake theory]] predicts a surging [[US dollar]] as global capital flows into US assets, Alden offers a nuanced counter-argument: the dollar may strengthen cyclically but faces structural long-term headwinds from fiscal deterioration, potential [[de-dollarization]], and the need to inflate away debt.

### Bitcoin as Emergent Store of Value
Alden frames [[Bitcoin]] not as a speculative tech bet but as a new asset class in its "price discovery phase." She emphasizes [[network effects]], fixed supply, and its role as a hedge against [[monetary debasement]]. Her book *Broken Money* (2023) traces the history of monetary systems to argue Bitcoin fits a centuries-long pattern of monetary evolution.

### Liquidity Cycle Framework
She tracks [[global liquidity]] — [[M2 money supply]], [[Fed balance sheet]], [[Treasury General Account]] — as the primary driver of asset prices, arguing that fiscal and monetary liquidity together explain most major market moves.

## Track Record

### Hits ✅
- Bullish on [[Bitcoin]] from ~$8,000 (2020) — rode the cycle to $69K
- Called the 2020-2021 [[inflation]] surge well before consensus, citing fiscal stimulus scale
- Bullish on [[energy stocks]] and [[commodities]] from 2020 lows — strong multi-year call
- Correctly cautious on [[US dollar]] strength being unsustainable long-term
- Fiscal dominance framework validated by 2023-2024 deficit spending despite "tight" monetary policy

### Misses ❌
- Underestimated US equity resilience in 2022-2023 — expected more pain from rate hikes than materialized for mega-cap tech
- Dollar bear timing — dollar remained stronger for longer than her framework suggested in 2022
- Bitcoin timing — some interim calls too early on cycle bottoms
- Emerging markets overweight hasn't paid off as strongly as expected vs US equities
