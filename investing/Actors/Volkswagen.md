## EU-China EV tariff deal (Jan 2026)

**VW broke ranks** with European OEM lobby to negotiate individual tariff relief.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Model affected | **Cupra Tavascan** |
| Factory | VW Anhui (Hefei, China) |
| Original tariff | 30.7% combined (20.7% + 10% base) |
| VW commitment | Limit models exported, set minimum prices |
| Expected outcome | 20.7% additional duty dropped |

**Strategic significance:** VW prioritized protecting its China-built EV exports over solidarity with European OEM lobby. Under EU rules, European brands manufacturing in China face same tariffs as Chinese OEMs — origin matters, not brand.

See [[EU-China EV tariffs]] for full deal details.
