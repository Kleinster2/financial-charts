## Why Hindenburg matters

**Defined activist short selling in the 2020s.** Anderson built on [[Muddy Waters]]' playbook but scaled impact dramatically. The Adani report wiped $150B in market cap — possibly the largest single short campaign in history.

**Real consequences.** Unlike many short sellers whose targets survive, Hindenburg's campaigns led to:
- 65 people facing fraud charges
- 24 criminal indictments
- 7 facing foreign sanctions
- Multiple bankruptcies (Nikola, Lordstown)

Anderson credited Carson Block of [[Muddy Waters]] with "blazing the trail."

## Nate Anderson

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Background | Former investment analyst; no formal Wall Street pedigree |
| Approach | Forensic research, whistleblower tips, on-the-ground investigation |
| Recognition | Wall Street Journal: "Wall Street's Pre-Eminent Short Seller" |

Anderson built Hindenburg with a small team, often working 80+ hour weeks on reports. The intensity contributed to his decision to close.

## The closure (January 2025)

On January 15, 2025, Anderson announced Hindenburg would disband:

> "We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking... The intensity of this work has been rather all-consuming."

He emphasized there was no external pressure or legal threat — just burnout from years of high-stakes investigative work.

**Legacy:** Hindenburg's closure leaves [[Muddy Waters]] as the dominant activist short seller, with Spruce Point, Kerrisdale, and others filling the gap.
