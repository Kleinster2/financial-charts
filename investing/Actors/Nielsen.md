## What Nielsen does

Nielsen measures who watches what, when, across linear TV, streaming, and digital. Its ratings are the transactional currency for TV ad buying -- networks use Nielsen numbers to set ad pricing (CPMs), and agencies use them to verify delivery.

Core products:

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| National TV ratings | Audience measurement for broadcast and cable (the flagship) |
| The Gauge | Monthly snapshot of total TV and streaming consumption shares |
| Streaming Content Ratings | Weekly top 10 rankings of most-watched streaming content |
| Ad-Supported Gauge | Breakdown of ad-supported viewing across platforms |
| Gracenote | Content recognition technology and metadata for content discovery |
| Analytics | Planning and optimization tools for advertisers and media companies |

Current methodology (Big Data + Panel, September 2025):

| Component | Scale |
|-----------|-------|
| Panel | 42,000+ homes, 100,000+ people |
| Big Data | 45M households, 75M devices (via [[Roku]], [[Comcast]], DISH, DirecTV, [[Vizio]]) |
| First-party streaming | Direct integrations with [[Amazon]], [[Netflix]] |
| Daily data processed | 100+ terabytes |

## History

| 1936 | Acquires Audimeter for measuring radio listenership |

| 1984 | Sold to [[Dun & Bradstreet]] for $1.3B |

| 2021 | Sells Global Connect business (now [[NIQ]]) to [[Advent International]] for $2.7B -- becomes pure-play media measurement |

## The NielsenIQ split

Nielsen split into two companies in 2021:

| Entity | Focus | Owner |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Nielsen (this note) | Media measurement, TV ratings | [[Elliott Management|Elliott Investment Management]] / [[Brookfield|Brookfield Business Partners]] |
| [[NIQ]] (formerly NielsenIQ) | Consumer packaged goods, retail measurement | [[Advent International]] (acquired for $2.7B, March 2021) |

NIQ acquired German market research firm [[GfK]] in 2023 and rebranded. The two companies are now completely separate.

---

## MRC accreditation crisis (2021-2023)

During COVID, Nielsen pulled field agents from panelist homes, leading to undercounting of TV audiences by up to ~6%. The [[MRC]] (Media Rating Council) suspended national TV accreditation in September 2021. Networks estimated hundreds of millions in lost ad revenue from the undercount.

Key responses:
- [[NBC|NBCU]] issued RFP for alternative measurement providers
- [[Disney]] publicly cited "inaccuracies and irregularities"
- Accreditation reinstated April 2023 after 19-month suspension
- Crisis accelerated multi-currency measurement movement

---

## Competitive landscape

Nielsen controls ~90% of the TV currency market but faces growing challenges.

| Competitor | Scale | 2024-25 momentum |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| [[VideoAmp]] | 40M+ households, 65M+ devices | $3B in upfront deals (2024, +880% YoY); revenue grew from ~$15M to ~$100M+ |
| [[Comscore]] (SCOR) | Large-scale set-top box data | Full JIC certification for 2025-26 season |
| [[iSpot]] | 51M+ TVs and STBs | Early [[NBC|NBCU]] partnership; smart TV ACR integrations |
| [[Kantar]] | 30,000 employees, global | #2 global market research firm; stronger outside U.S. |

### JIC (Joint Industry Committee)

The U.S. JIC certified [[Comscore]], [[iSpot]], and [[VideoAmp]] as currencies for 2025-26 -- the first time alternatives have been formally endorsed alongside Nielsen. Nielsen has not participated in the JIC process, citing legal, operational, and scientific concerns. Six of seven major ad holding companies still signed new multi-year Nielsen deals.

## Why it matters (even as a private company)

Nielsen's measurement decisions directly affect ad pricing and valuation narratives for public media and ad-tech companies:

| Company | Ticker | Nielsen link |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| [[Comscore]] | SCOR | Direct competitor; benefits from Nielsen disruption |
| [[Roku]] | ROKU | Major data partner; 21% of all TV viewing; measurement partnership validates ad inventory |
| [[Trade Desk]] | TTD | Benefits from multi-currency world; programmatic CTV buying needs standardized measurement |
| [[Disney]] | DIS | Major Nielsen customer; ESPN/ABC/Hulu ad revenue tied to ratings |
| [[Comcast]] | CMCSA | Data partner for Big Data + Panel; NBCU first to sign alternative measurement deal |
| [[Warner Bros Discovery]] | WBD | Nielsen customer; signed [[VideoAmp]] deals |
| [[Netflix]] | NFLX | Streaming measurement partnership; Christmas NFL viewership validated by Nielsen |
| [[Amazon]] | AMZN | TNF measurement; Amazon DSP integrated with Nielsen |
| [[Fox Corporation|Fox]] | FOX | Major broadcast network; NFL rights value tied to Nielsen ratings |

Key dynamics:
- Ratings = ad pricing. Higher Nielsen numbers translate directly to higher CPMs. Big Data + Panel lifted NFL numbers ~3-4%, worth real money in ad negotiations.
- Multi-currency risk. If the market fragments away from Nielsen as sole currency, it creates complexity and costs for ad buyers. Agencies prefer one standard -- Nielsen's moat.
- Streaming validation. Streamers need third-party measurement to prove ad inventory value. Nielsen's Gauge and streaming ratings justify how [[Roku]], [[Netflix]], and [[Amazon]] price their ads.
- PE exit. Elliott and Brookfield bought at ~10x EBITDA with heavy leverage. An eventual re-IPO or strategic sale would be a significant event.
