## Insights

**Smallest of Big Four** — but still part of the oligopoly controlling 80%+ of title insurance. Lost market share (10.6% in 2019 → 9.2% in 2025) but investing in technology and acquisitions to recover.

**Pure-play title** — unlike diversified [[Old Republic International]], Stewart is focused entirely on title and real estate services.
