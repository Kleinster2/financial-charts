## At Anki (2010–2019)

Co-founded with Mark Palatucci and Hanns Tappeiner (all CMU Robotics Institute). Products: Anki Drive (AI racing cars), Cozmo (social robot), Vector. Raised $200M+, shipped 3.5M+ devices, ~$100M annual revenue by 2017. Company shut down in 2019 due to funding challenges despite strong consumer traction.

## At Waymo (2019–2024)

Led autonomous trucking program plus core technologies spanning perception, reliability, and freeway driving for both cars and trucks. Helped push [[Waymo]] One ride-hailing network to public launch. Drove the shift from traditional robotics (search, heuristics, engineered solutions) to ML-driven autonomy systems.

---

## At Bedrock Robotics (2024–present)

Co-founded with three other ex-[[Waymo]] engineers (Kevin Peterson, Ajay Gummalla, Tom Eliaz). Applying AV-grade autonomy stack to construction equipment — retrofitting existing excavators, bulldozers, and loaders. $350M+ raised, $1.75B valuation as of Feb 2026. Targeting first fully operator-less deployments in 2026.

## Technical philosophy

Advocates ML-driven approach over hand-coded heuristics. Construction requires centimeter-level precision in unstructured environments with varying soil compositions — trains AI on large-scale datasets from expert operators rather than engineering specific scenarios. PhD work focused on enabling robots to navigate unfamiliar domains through online learning — a direct throughline to Bedrock's construction autonomy challenge.
