## February 2026: The 40% cut

On Feb 26, 2026, [[Jack Dorsey]] announced Block would cut ~4,000 employees — 40% of its workforce — explicitly attributing it to AI. Stock surged 24% after-hours. Restructuring charge: $450-500M.

This was not a company in distress. Q4 2025 gross profit grew 24% YoY to $2.87B. FY2026 guide: $12.2B gross profit (+18%), adj EPS $3.66 (beat est. $3.22). Dorsey framed it as permanent structural change and predicted most companies would follow within a year.

Fourth round of cuts since late 2023 (8% → 1,000 → 931 → 4,000), but first to name AI directly. The largest and most explicit [[AI labor displacement]] event to date.

See [[Block AI layoffs February 2026]] for full detail.
