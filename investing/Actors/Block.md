# Block

**Block** — fintech platform spanning merchant payments ([[Square]], $250B GPV, 4.5M sellers) and consumer finance ([[Cash App]], 59M MAU, $1.83B Q4 gross profit growing 33%). FY2025 gross profit hit $10.4B (+17%), guiding $12.2B for 2026 — then [[Jack Dorsey]] cut 40% of the workforce (4,000 jobs) on Feb 26, 2026, explicitly blaming AI, while posting record profits. Stock surged 24% — the market's clearest signal yet that it will reward [[AI labor displacement]]. The bull case: Cash App lending is scaling fast (+223% Q4 Borrow originations), margins are about to expand dramatically (adj op income guided +54%), and buybacks ($2.3B/yr) hit harder at 80% below ATH. The bear case: the [[Afterpay]] acquisition was a $13.9B mistake, Bitcoin revenue is volatile, and the "AI restructuring" narrative may be dressing up years of Dorsey's overhiring. Watch Q1-Q2 execution — can 6,000 people do what 10,000 did?

## Business segments

Block reorganized its reporting in 2025 into three revenue engines:

### Commerce Enablement (Square)

The original business. Point-of-sale hardware and software for merchants — card readers, terminals, inventory management, payroll, e-commerce, appointments, invoicing. U.S. market leader in SMB POS.

| Metric | FY2025 |
|--------|--------|
| GPV | ~$250B (+10% YoY) |
| Sellers | 4.5M+ |
| Q4 GPV growth | 10.3% YoY |
| Q4 NVA growth | 29% YoY (62% sales-led) |
| Q4 revenue | $3.05B (+11.1%) |

New hardware: Square Handheld and second-gen Square Register launched in 2025. Moving upmarket from micro-merchants to mid-market sellers.

### Financial Solutions (Cash App)

Consumer fintech platform — P2P payments, direct deposit, debit card, stock/Bitcoin investing, personal lending (Borrow), tax filing. Has evolved from Venmo competitor to a neobank.

| Metric | FY2025 |
|--------|--------|
| MAU | 59M |
| Primary banking actives | 9.3M (+22% YoY) |
| Q4 gross profit | $1.83B (+33% YoY) |
| Commerce volume | $54.7B in Q4 (+17%) |
| Lending origination growth | +50% FY, +69% Q4 |
| Borrow origination growth | +223% Q4 YoY |

Cash App is now Block's dominant profit engine. Cash App Green (rewards/banking status program) driving 14% attach rate on personalized offers, up from 2%.

### Bitcoin Ecosystem

Bitcoin buying/selling on Cash App, [[Bitkey]] (self-custody hardware wallet), Proto (Bitcoin mining rigs — initial shipments in Q4 2025), and Lightning Network payments on Square terminals.

| Metric | Q4 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| Q4 revenue | $1.98B (-19.6% YoY) |
| Bitcoin on balance sheet | ~8,211 BTC (~$760M at Q4 prices) |

Revenue volatility driven by Bitcoin price swings and low-margin pass-through. Dorsey remains a Bitcoin maximalist — the long-term thesis is Bitcoin as internet-native currency with Block as the on-ramp.

### TIDAL

Music streaming service acquired from [[Jay-Z]] in 2021 for $293M. Strategic fit unclear — Dorsey's vision was artist-centric payments via blockchain. Small contributor to overall financials.

## Evolution

The story of Block is the story of Dorsey's ambition expanding faster than execution could follow — until AI gave him the knife to cut it all back.

- 2009: [[Jim McKelvey]] can't accept a $2,000 credit card payment for his glass art. He and [[Jack Dorsey]] build a white dongle that plugs into an iPhone headphone jack. Square is born in a St. Louis office. The insight: millions of small merchants were locked out of card payments because existing POS systems cost thousands. Square's card reader cost nothing — they made money on the 2.75% swipe fee
- 2011-2012: [[Visa]] invests. [[Starbucks]] signs a POS deal and puts in $25M. GPV hits $6B/year. Square becomes the default payments stack for micro-merchants — food trucks, farmers markets, barber shops. The brand becomes a verb: "I'll Square you"
- 2013: Cash App launches as a simple P2P payment tool — Dorsey's attempt to build a consumer side alongside the merchant business. It's a Venmo clone initially, but the decision to build both sides of the payments ecosystem (merchant + consumer) is the strategic fork that defines everything that follows
- 2015: IPO at $9/share, valuing Square at $2.9B — a discount that reflected Wall Street's core concern: Dorsey was simultaneously CEO of Twitter, which he'd just returned to lead. Square listed its dual-CEO arrangement as a risk factor in its own S-1. The stock barely moved for a year. Investors didn't trust a CEO splitting attention between two public companies
- 2017-2018: The Cash App pivot. Bitcoin buying/selling added to Cash App (Nov 2017) and stock investing added soon after. These weren't revenue drivers — they were acquisition hooks. Cash App MAU exploded from ~7M (Dec 2017) to 24M+ by 2019. The app transformed from Venmo alternative into proto-neobank. Simultaneously, Square filed for an industrial bank charter (Square Financial Services, approved 2020) — signaling the move from payments processor to actual bank
- 2020: COVID. Cashless payments adoption accelerates by years overnight. Cash App becomes a lifeline — stimulus checks, direct deposits, P2P payments for people avoiding physical contact. Square puts $50M into Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet — one of the first public companies to do so. Dorsey's Bitcoin maximalism shifts from personal hobby to corporate strategy. Stock goes from ~$50 pre-COVID to $280 by mid-2021
- 2021 (peak hubris): Stock hits $281.81 ATH in August. Dorsey goes on an acquisition spree that now looks like peak-of-cycle empire building: [[TIDAL]] ($293M, from [[Jay-Z]] — the strategic logic of a music streaming service inside a payments company was never convincingly explained), then [[Afterpay]] ($29B announced in Aug, the largest BNPL acquisition ever). In November, Dorsey resigns from Twitter to focus on Square full-time. In December, renames the company to Block — "something that can be built upon infinitely." The name change, the acquisitions, the grandiose language — this is the moment of maximum expansion
- 2022: Reality hits. [[Afterpay]] acquisition closes in January at ~$13.9B (paid in all-stock — Block shares had cratered, so the deal was worth half the announced price, but the dilution was locked in). BNPL as a category is collapsing under rising rates. The stock, which peaked at $281, spends the year falling to $50s. The Afterpay deal becomes the canonical bad acquisition — buying at the top of a bubble with your own overvalued stock, which then also collapses
- 2023-2024: Austerity begins. Layoffs in waves: 8% (late 2023), ~1,000 (Jan 2024). None mention AI. Dorsey starts winding down the vanity projects: TBD (decentralized web) shuttered, TIDAL scaled back, resources refocused on Square + Cash App + Bitcoin mining. Cash App crosses 55M MAU and starts making real money as a neobank (lending, direct deposit, debit card). Square Financial Services begins originating loans directly. The business underneath the stock carnage is actually working
- 2025: Ticker changes from SQ to XYZ (January). S&P 500 inclusion (July, replacing [[Hess Corporation]]). Gross profit crosses $10B. Share buybacks of $2.3B at depressed prices. Proto mining rigs begin shipping. Rule of 40 achieved in Q4. Another 931 jobs cut in March — still no mention of AI. The company is quietly becoming profitable and focused, but the stock is still 80% below ATH
- 2026 (Feb): [[Block AI layoffs February 2026|The 40% cut]]. 4,000 jobs eliminated in one stroke. Dorsey explicitly blames AI — says "intelligence tools" make these roles unnecessary and predicts most companies will follow within a year. Stock surges 24% overnight. After years of building a sprawling, overstaffed conglomerate, Dorsey uses AI as both the tool and the justification to cut it back to fighting weight. Whether this is genuine AI transformation or Dorsey finally right-sizing what he should have never over-hired — the market doesn't care. The result is the same: $12.2B gross profit guide on 6,000 people instead of 10,000

## February 2026: The 40% cut

On Feb 26, 2026, [[Jack Dorsey]] announced Block would cut ~4,000 employees — 40% of its workforce — explicitly attributing it to AI. Stock surged 24% after-hours. Restructuring charge: $450-500M.

This was not a company in distress. Q4 2025 gross profit grew 24% YoY to $2.87B. FY2026 guide: $12.2B gross profit (+18%), adj EPS $3.66 (beat est. $3.22). Dorsey framed it as permanent structural change and predicted most companies would follow within a year.

Fourth round of cuts since late 2023 (8% → 1,000 → 931 → 4,000), but first to name AI directly. The largest and most explicit [[AI labor displacement]] event to date. Engineering code output per engineer already up 40%+ since September from AI tool adoption.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Cash App is a growth monster — 59M MAU, 33% GP growth, lending scaling fast
- Gross profit trajectory: $8.9B → $10.4B → $12.2B guide in three years
- Post-layoff margins should expand dramatically — adj op income guided to $3.2B (+54%)
- Share buybacks at $2.3B/year while stock is 80% below ATH
- Rule of 40 achieved — growth + profitability balanced
- Square upmarket push (sales-led NVA +62%) expanding TAM
- Bitcoin optionality if crypto cycle returns
- AI restructuring creates structural cost advantage vs. peers

Bear:
- Still 80% below ATH — years of shareholder value destruction
- Afterpay acquisition was a $13.9B mistake (acquired near BNPL peak, paid in stock)
- Dorsey distraction risk — co-founded Twitter, ran both companies simultaneously, Bitcoin maximalism sometimes eclipses core business
- Bitcoin revenue volatility (-19.6% Q4) adds noise
- Cash App competition: [[Venmo]] ([[PayPal]]), Zelle, Apple Pay
- Square competition: [[Toast]], Clover, Shopify POS
- Is the 40% cut genuinely AI-driven or belated right-sizing of years of overhiring? (The Dorsey paradox — he built Twitter with 7,500 people that Musk ran with 1,300)
- Borrow loan losses rising in Dec/Jan — early cohort risk in lending push
- TIDAL remains a strategic question mark

## Peers

| Company | Focus | Market cap | GPV/TPV |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| [[PayPal]] | Payments + Venmo | ~$70B | $1.5T+ |
| [[Toast]] | Restaurant POS | ~$20B | — |
| [[Adyen]] | Enterprise payments | ~$45B | €1T+ |
| [[Stripe]] | Online payments | Private (~$65B) | — |
| [[Robinhood]] | Consumer investing | ~$30B | — |
| [[SoFi Technologies]] | Consumer fintech | ~$15B | — |

Block is unique in straddling both merchant payments (like Toast/Adyen) and consumer finance (like Robinhood/SoFi), with Bitcoin as a differentiator no peer matches.
