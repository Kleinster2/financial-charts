# Block

**Block** — fintech platform spanning merchant payments ([[Square]], $250B GPV, 4.5M sellers) and consumer finance ([[Cash App]], 59M MAU, $1.83B Q4 gross profit growing 33%). FY2025 gross profit hit $10.4B (+17%), guiding $12.2B for 2026 — then [[Jack Dorsey]] cut 40% of the workforce (4,000 jobs) on Feb 26, 2026, explicitly blaming AI, while posting record profits. Stock surged 24% — the market's clearest signal yet that it will reward [[AI labor displacement]]. The bull case: Cash App lending is scaling fast (+223% Q4 Borrow originations), margins are about to expand dramatically (adj op income guided +54%), and buybacks ($2.3B/yr) hit harder at 80% below ATH. The bear case: the [[Afterpay]] acquisition was a $13.9B mistake, Bitcoin revenue is volatile, and the "AI restructuring" narrative may be dressing up years of Dorsey's overhiring. Watch Q1-Q2 execution — can 6,000 people do what 10,000 did?

## Business segments

Block reorganized its reporting in 2025 into three revenue engines:

### Commerce Enablement (Square)

The original business. Point-of-sale hardware and software for merchants — card readers, terminals, inventory management, payroll, e-commerce, appointments, invoicing. U.S. market leader in SMB POS.

| Metric | FY2025 |
|--------|--------|
| GPV | ~$250B (+10% YoY) |
| Sellers | 4.5M+ |
| Q4 GPV growth | 10.3% YoY |
| Q4 NVA growth | 29% YoY (62% sales-led) |
| Q4 revenue | $3.05B (+11.1%) |

New hardware: Square Handheld and second-gen Square Register launched in 2025. Moving upmarket from micro-merchants to mid-market sellers.

### Financial Solutions (Cash App)

Consumer fintech platform — P2P payments, direct deposit, debit card, stock/Bitcoin investing, personal lending (Borrow), tax filing. Has evolved from Venmo competitor to a neobank.

| Metric | FY2025 |
|--------|--------|
| MAU | 59M |
| Primary banking actives | 9.3M (+22% YoY) |
| Q4 gross profit | $1.83B (+33% YoY) |
| Commerce volume | $54.7B in Q4 (+17%) |
| Lending origination growth | +50% FY, +69% Q4 |
| Borrow origination growth | +223% Q4 YoY |

Cash App is now Block's dominant profit engine. Cash App Green (rewards/banking status program) driving 14% attach rate on personalized offers, up from 2%.

### Bitcoin Ecosystem

Bitcoin buying/selling on Cash App, [[Bitkey]] (self-custody hardware wallet), Proto (Bitcoin mining rigs — initial shipments in Q4 2025), and Lightning Network payments on Square terminals.

| Metric | Q4 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| Q4 revenue | $1.98B (-19.6% YoY) |
| Bitcoin on balance sheet | ~8,211 BTC (~$760M at Q4 prices) |

Revenue volatility driven by Bitcoin price swings and low-margin pass-through. Dorsey remains a Bitcoin maximalist — the long-term thesis is Bitcoin as internet-native currency with Block as the on-ramp.

### TIDAL

Music streaming service acquired from [[Jay-Z]] in 2021 for $293M. Strategic fit unclear — Dorsey's vision was artist-centric payments via blockchain. Small contributor to overall financials.

## Evolution

- 2009: [[Jack Dorsey]] and [[Jim McKelvey]] found Square after McKelvey can't accept a credit card for his glasswork. The white square card reader becomes iconic
- 2013: Cash App launched as a simple P2P payment tool
- 2015: IPO at $9/share on NYSE as SQ. Valued at ~$2.9B — modest for the era
- 2018: Acquired [[Weebly]] (~$365M) for small business websites/e-commerce. Square Financial Services bank charter application filed
- 2020: $50M Bitcoin purchase — one of first public companies to put Bitcoin on balance sheet. COVID accelerates cashless payments adoption
- 2021 (peak): Stock hits $281.81 ATH in August. Acquired [[TIDAL]] ($293M) and [[Afterpay]] ($29B announced, closed Jan 2022 at ~$13.9B after stock decline). Renamed to Block Inc in December — reflecting multi-business ambitions beyond Square
- 2022: [[Afterpay]] acquisition closes at ~$13.9B (paid in stock — massive value destruction as Block shares fell). BNPL integration into Square and Cash App begins
- 2023-2024: Post-pandemic hangover. Stock collapses from $281 to ~$50s. First layoffs: 8% in late 2023, ~1,000 in Jan 2024. Focus shifts to profitability
- 2025: Ticker changes from SQ to XYZ. Gross profit crosses $10B. Share buybacks of $2.3B. Proto mining rigs begin shipping. Rule of 40 achieved in Q4
- 2026 (Feb): [[Block AI layoffs February 2026|Cuts 40% of workforce]] — 4,000 jobs eliminated, explicitly attributed to AI. Stock surges 24%. Largest AI-attributed corporate restructuring to date

The arc: card reader startup → payments platform → Bitcoin bet → sprawling conglomerate → AI-driven consolidation. The Afterpay acquisition at $29B (closing at $13.9B) was the peak of Dorsey's empire-building phase. The 2026 layoffs mark the pivot to radical efficiency.

## February 2026: The 40% cut

On Feb 26, 2026, [[Jack Dorsey]] announced Block would cut ~4,000 employees — 40% of its workforce — explicitly attributing it to AI. Stock surged 24% after-hours. Restructuring charge: $450-500M.

This was not a company in distress. Q4 2025 gross profit grew 24% YoY to $2.87B. FY2026 guide: $12.2B gross profit (+18%), adj EPS $3.66 (beat est. $3.22). Dorsey framed it as permanent structural change and predicted most companies would follow within a year.

Fourth round of cuts since late 2023 (8% → 1,000 → 931 → 4,000), but first to name AI directly. The largest and most explicit [[AI labor displacement]] event to date. Engineering code output per engineer already up 40%+ since September from AI tool adoption.

Key AI products referenced: ManagerBot and MoneyBot — proprietary AI assistants for automated financial and business management.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Cash App is a growth monster — 59M MAU, 33% GP growth, lending scaling fast
- Gross profit trajectory: $8.9B → $10.4B → $12.2B guide in three years
- Post-layoff margins should expand dramatically — adj op income guided to $3.2B (+54%)
- Share buybacks at $2.3B/year while stock is 80% below ATH
- Rule of 40 achieved — growth + profitability balanced
- Square upmarket push (sales-led NVA +62%) expanding TAM
- Bitcoin optionality if crypto cycle returns
- AI restructuring creates structural cost advantage vs. peers

Bear:
- Still 80% below ATH — years of shareholder value destruction
- Afterpay acquisition was a $13.9B mistake (acquired near BNPL peak, paid in stock)
- Dorsey distraction risk — co-founded Twitter, ran both companies simultaneously, Bitcoin maximalism sometimes eclipses core business
- Bitcoin revenue volatility (-19.6% Q4) adds noise
- Cash App competition: [[Venmo]] ([[PayPal]]), Zelle, Apple Pay
- Square competition: [[Toast]], Clover, Shopify POS
- Is the 40% cut genuinely AI-driven or belated right-sizing of years of overhiring? (The Dorsey paradox — he built Twitter with 7,500 people that Musk ran with 1,300)
- Borrow loan losses rising in Dec/Jan — early cohort risk in lending push
- TIDAL remains a strategic question mark

## Peers

| Company | Focus | Market cap | GPV/TPV |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| [[PayPal]] | Payments + Venmo | ~$70B | $1.5T+ |
| [[Toast]] | Restaurant POS | ~$20B | — |
| [[Adyen]] | Enterprise payments | ~$45B | €1T+ |
| [[Stripe]] | Online payments | Private (~$65B) | — |
| [[Robinhood]] | Consumer investing | ~$30B | — |
| [[SoFi Technologies]] | Consumer fintech | ~$15B | — |

Block is unique in straddling both merchant payments (like Toast/Adyen) and consumer finance (like Robinhood/SoFi), with Bitcoin as a differentiator no peer matches.
