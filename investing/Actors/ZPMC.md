## US Security Concerns

Since 2023, ZPMC has faced scrutiny from US Congress over potential espionage capabilities:

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2023 | Post-balloon incident, cranes investigated |
| Mar 2024 | Congressional report: cranes can be remotely monitored/controlled by China |
| Feb 2024 | US Coast Guard to oversee port crane cybersecurity |
| Ongoing | US investing in domestic crane alternatives |

ZPMC's response: Cranes comply with international standards and customer specifications; no cybersecurity threat.

## Investment Angle

**Exposure routes:**
- Direct: 600320.SS (limited liquidity for foreign investors)
- Indirect: [[SIPG]] (customer), Chinese industrial ETFs

**Bull case:**
- Near-monopoly in critical infrastructure
- Automation tailwind as ports upgrade
- State backing for international expansion
- Cost advantage vs Western competitors

**Bear case:**
- US/Western customers may diversify away
- Geopolitical headwind intensifying
- Military-civil fusion scrutiny
- Revenue at risk if security concerns spread globally
