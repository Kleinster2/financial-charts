## Macro (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Current | [[Target]]/Outlook |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Selic rate** | 15.00% | COPOM holding — no easing imminent; market expects ~12% by year-end |
| **[[Inflation]]** | 4.26% (Dec 2025) | [[Target]] 3% (±1.5pp tolerance) |
| **GDP growth** | 3.2% avg (2022-24) | 2.0-2.2% (2025-27), signs of cooling |
| **Public debt/GDP** | ~78% | Rising; projected R$9.3-10.3T federal debt by year-end |
| **10Y yield** | ~13.6% | Sticky risk premia, election-year uncertainty |

**Macro story:** 15% [[Selic]] crushing corporates — record bankruptcy filings, [[Raizen]] downgraded from investment grade to CCC in a single day (Feb 2026). [[Banco Central do Brasil]] holding firm despite political pressure. Easing timeline uncertain; 2026 presidential election reduces fiscal consolidation appetite. See [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]].

## Why Brazil matters

| Factor | Investment relevance |
|--------|---------------------|
| **[[Fintech]] hub** | Highest adoption globally; [[Pix]] leapfrogged cards |
| **Commodity exporter** | Iron ore, soybeans, oil — China-dependent |
| **High rates** | Tough for growth stocks; opportunity when cycle turns |
| **Large domestic market** | 215M people, growing middle class |
| **Currency volatility** | BRL swings create entry/exit points |

## [[Pix]]: Instant payments revolution

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launch | November 2020 |
| Users | **182M+** (87% of adults) |
| Transactions (2024) | 64B (+53% YoY) |
| Mobile banking adoption | 90% (vs 56% in 2020) |
| vs Cards | Surpassed debit + credit combined by 80% |

**Key milestones:**
- **[[Pix]] Automático** (Jun 2025) — recurring payments
- **[[Pix]] por Aproximação** (Feb 2025) — contactless
- **17M Brazilians** brought into financial system

**Why it matters:** Low-income Brazilians adopted [[Pix]] because they lack credit card access. Leapfrogged traditional payments — mobile banking adoption (90%) now exceeds US (75%).

## Investment themes

### [[Fintech]] dominance
- [[Pix]] killed card growth
- 90% mobile banking penetration
- [[StoneCo]], [[Nubank]] competing with traditional banks
- AI + [[WhatsApp]] payments emerging (Itaú, [[PicPay]])

### Rate cycle & corporate distress
- [[Selic]] at 15% — highest in ~20 years, COPOM holding
- Record 2,273 bankruptcy filings in 2024 (+62% YoY); 8.1M businesses with negative credit
- [[Raizen]], [[CSN]] downgrades signal broader corporate stress — see [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]]
- Growth stocks compressed; could re-rate on eventual cuts, but timing uncertain

### China dependency
- \#1 iron ore supplier ([[Vale]])
- Soybean exporter
- China slowdown = Brazil commodity risk
- **Chinese M&A:** [[Chinalco]] near acquiring [[Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio|CBA]] ($1.15B, Jan 2026) — securing non-China aluminum supply

### Currency as swing factor
- BRL volatility creates timing opportunities
- USD strength pressures EM broadly

### US IPO pipeline (2026 revival)

After a 4-year drought (2022-2025) with essentially zero Brazilian IPOs on US exchanges, two fintechs listed in early 2026:

| Company | Ticker | Exchange | Date | Raised | Post-IPO |
|---------|--------|----------|------|--------|----------|
| [[PicPay]] | PICS | NASDAQ | Jan 29 | ~$434M | Down ~20% |
| [[Agibank]] | AGBK | NYSE | Feb 11 | $240M (slashed from $785M) | Down ~11% |

**Both listings struggled.** PicPay's post-IPO decline directly caused Agibank to slash its deal size by >50% hours before pricing. Bloomberg called it a "bumpy comeback."

**Why US over [[B3]]:**
- US exchanges allow **dual-class shares** (supervoting for founders) — [[B3]]'s Novo Mercado requires one-share-one-vote
- Higher valuations for fintech/tech from US investor base
- Deeper capital pools, broader institutional demand
- Precedent from [[PagSeguro]], [[StoneCo]], [[Nubank]] (2018-2021 wave)
- [[Foreign Private Issuer]] status: relaxed reporting, IFRS instead of GAAP

**Pipeline:** UBS BB poll shows institutional investors expect 10+ Brazilian IPOs in 2026 (domestic + US). 100+ companies reportedly IPO-ready. New [[Base Exchange]] (backed by [[Mubadala]]) targeting April 2026 launch in Rio adds optionality beyond [[B3]].

## Monetary policy history

Brazil is a case study in [[Time consistency]] — both violations and successful reforms. See [[Banco Central do Brasil]] for full institutional detail.

| Era | Policy | Outcome |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **1980-1994** | CB financed deficits, no independence | Hyperinflation (3,000%/year), six failed stabilization plans |
| **1994 Plano Real** | Fiscal reform + credible currency | Inflation: 90%/month → single digits |
| **2003-2011 Lula I/II** | Maintained post-Real consensus | Credibility preserved despite leftist president |
| **2011-2016 Dilma** | Replaced CB board, "New Economic Matrix" | Inflation doubled (5.9% → 10.7%), impeachment |
| **2021** | Formal CB independence law (Bolsonaro) | Fixed terms, can't fire governor at will |
| **2023-2024 Lula III** | Attacked CB, called independence "nonsense" | CB held firm under Campos Neto |
| **2025 Galípolo** | Lula's pick takes over Jan 1, 2025 | **Most aggressive hiking cycle in years** — Selic 10.75% → 15% |

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Gabriel Galípolo — Lula's own pick — turned out to be a credible inflation hawk. Raised Selic by 450bp (10.75% → 15%) and held despite Lula's pressure. **K-P vindicated** — the 2021 independence law worked; even Lula's appointee prioritizes credibility over politics.

## Import tariff hike (Feb 2026)

Government raised import tariffs on **1,000+ products** by up to 7.2 pp — smartphones, industrial machinery, medical equipment, electronics. Import penetration had risen above 45% of domestic consumption. Top import sources: US (34.7%), China (21.1%). Industry warns domestic manufacturers can't fill the gap and costs will cascade. Political irony: Brazil was criticizing Trump's tariffs while raising its own.

See **[[Brazil Import Protectionism]]** for full analysis.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Fiscal slippage | Debt ~78% GDP, interest payments potentially >60% of tax revenue |
| Corporate distress spiral | 15% rates → defaults → fiscal pressure → harder to cut → doom loop risk |
| Prolonged high rates | Growth stocks underperform, leveraged corporates restructure |
| China slowdown | Commodity exports hit |
| Political volatility | Policy uncertainty |
| USD strength | BRL weakness, capital outflows |
| Protectionism | Feb 2026 tariff hike raises input costs, risks inflation pass-through |
