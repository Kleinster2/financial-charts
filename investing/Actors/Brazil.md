## Why Brazil matters

| Factor | Investment relevance |
|--------|---------------------|

| **Large domestic market** | 215M people, growing middle class |

## [[Pix]]: Instant payments revolution

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launch | November 2020 |
| Users | **182M+** (87% of adults) |
| Transactions (2024) | 64B (+53% YoY) |
| Mobile banking adoption | 90% (vs 56% in 2020) |
| vs Cards | Surpassed debit + credit combined by 80% |

**Key milestones:**
- **[[Pix]] Automático** (Jun 2025) — recurring payments
- **[[Pix]] por Aproximação** (Feb 2025) — contactless

**Why it matters:** Low-income Brazilians adopted [[Pix]] because they lack credit card access. Leapfrogged traditional payments — mobile banking adoption (90%) now exceeds US (75%).

## Investment themes

### [[Fintech]] dominance
- [[Pix]] killed card growth
- 90% mobile banking penetration
- [[StoneCo]], [[Nubank]] competing with traditional banks
- AI + [[WhatsApp]] payments emerging (Itaú, [[PicPay]])

### Rate cycle
- Selic at 15% — one of highest globally
- Easing expected 2026
- Growth stocks compressed; could re-rate on cuts

### China dependency
- #1 iron ore supplier ([[Vale]])
- Soybean exporter
- China slowdown = Brazil commodity risk
- **Chinese M&A:** [[Chinalco]] near acquiring [[Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio|CBA]] ($1.15B, Jan 2026) — securing non-China aluminum supply

### Currency as swing factor
- BRL volatility creates timing opportunities
- USD strength pressures EM broadly

## Monetary policy history

Brazil is a case study in [[Time consistency]] — both violations and successful reforms. See [[Banco Central do Brasil]] for full institutional detail.

| Era | Policy | Outcome |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **1980-1994** | CB financed deficits, no independence | Hyperinflation (3,000%/year), six failed stabilization plans |
| **1994 Plano Real** | Fiscal reform + credible currency | Inflation: 90%/month → single digits |
| **2003-2011 Lula I/II** | Maintained post-Real consensus | Credibility preserved despite leftist president |
| **2011-2016 Dilma** | Replaced CB board, "New Economic Matrix" | Inflation doubled (5.9% → 10.7%), impeachment |
| **2021** | Formal CB independence law (Bolsonaro) | Fixed terms, can't fire governor at will |
| **2023-2024 Lula III** | Attacked CB, called independence "nonsense" | CB held firm under Campos Neto |
| **2025 Galípolo** | Lula's pick takes over Jan 1, 2025 | **Most aggressive hiking cycle in years** — Selic 10.75% → 15% |

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Gabriel Galípolo — Lula's own pick — turned out to be a credible inflation hawk. Raised Selic by 450bp (10.75% → 15%) and held despite Lula's pressure. **K-P vindicated** — the 2021 independence law worked; even Lula's appointee prioritizes credibility over politics.

| Fiscal slippage | Debt concerns, inflation expectations unanchored |
