## Why UHS matters

**Behavioral health leader.** Unlike [[HCA Healthcare]] (pure acute care), UHS operates the largest behavioral health network in the US. Mental health demand has surged post-COVID, and capacity is severely constrained.

**Dual growth engines.** Acute care and behavioral health segments allow UHS to capture both surgical volume recovery and mental health tailwinds simultaneously.

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Behavioral health capacity shortage supports pricing power
- State supplemental payments providing tailwind
- Undervalued vs [[HCA Healthcare]]
- Dual-segment model diversifies risk

**Bear case:**
- Family control limits governance
- Behavioral health reimbursement at risk
- Labor shortages in nursing
- Smaller scale than HCA
