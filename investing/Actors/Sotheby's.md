# Sotheby's

280-year-old auction house taken private by [[Patrick Drahi]] in 2019 for $3.7B after 31 years on NYSE. Now struggling as art market contracts, with [[ADQ]] buying 24% stake to help pay down debt.

## 2024 Performance

| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Total sales | $6.0B | $7.8B | -23% |
| Auction sales | $4.6B | $6.4B | -28% |
| Private sales | $1.4B | $1.2B | +17% |

| Pre-tax loss | -$248M | -$106M | worse |

Luxury segment delivered $2B+ for third consecutive year. Sotheby's Financial Services issued $1.3B in art-backed loans, completed $700M securitization.

## Ownership & Capital

Drahi acquired Sotheby's in June 2019, delisting from NYSE. Loaded the company with debt as part of his typical LBO playbook.

**Dec 2024**: [[ADQ]] (Abu Dhabi sovereign fund) bought 24% for $909M. Proceeds plus Drahi top-up used to:
- Pay down portion of $1.6B debt
- Acquire new Madison Avenue headquarters in NYC

ADQ investment valued Sotheby's at ~$3.8B equity, roughly flat to 2019 purchase despite art market boom/bust cycle.

## Art Market Context

Global art market contracting from 2021-2022 peaks. Christie's 2024 sales also down 6% to $5.7B. High-end lots scarce as collectors hold amid uncertainty. Sotheby's pivoting toward private sales and lending as auction volumes decline.
