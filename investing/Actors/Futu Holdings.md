## Price history

![[futu-price-chart.png]]
*FUTU since IPO (Mar 2019). Peaked $186 in Feb 2021 during the Chinese retail trading boom, crashed to $24 on CSRC crackdown, then hit new ATH of $199 in Oct 2025 on international expansion — worth more without China than with it.*

![[futu-vs-hood-price-chart.png]]
*FUTU (blue) vs [[Robinhood]] (HOOD) normalized since HOOD IPO (Jul 2021). Both crashed from peaks but FUTU has outperformed on fundamentals - 87% gross margins vs HOOD's ~50%.*

## Business model

Futu generates revenue from three main streams:

### 1. Brokerage commissions (45% of Q3 2025 revenue)
- HK$2.91B ($374M) in Q3 2025, +90.6% YoY
- Commission on trades across US stocks, HK stocks, SG stocks, AU stocks, JP stocks, CA stocks, MY stocks, options, ETFs, crypto
- Blended commission rate declining (volume growth outpacing rate)

### 2. Interest income (48% of Q3 2025 revenue)
- HK$3.05B ($391M) in Q3 2025, +79.2% YoY
- Margin financing and securities lending
- Margin balance: HK$63.1B, +55.2% YoY, +22.8% QoQ
- This is the "hidden" profit engine â€" borrow cheap, lend to clients at spread

### 3. Other income (7%)
- HK$444M ($57M) in Q3 2025, +113% YoY
- Currency exchange services, fund distribution, IPO subscription fees
- Wealth management AUM: HK$175.6B
- 561 IPO distribution/IR clients, +21.7% YoY

Key insight: Unlike [[Robinhood]] (which relies heavily on PFOF and crypto), Futu has a diversified, high-margin revenue model. Interest income provides a quasi-recurring base while brokerage commissions ride trading volume cycles.

## Evolution

The story of Futu is the story of a Tencent engineer who built a brokerage for himself, had his home market taken away by regulators, and accidentally built something bigger by being forced to go international.

- 2008-2012: [[Leaf Hua Li]] was Tencent's 18th employee — he joined in 2000 when the company was a startup and rose to run the multimedia business unit and innovation center. By 2008, he'd made enough money to trade Hong Kong stocks actively, and he hated every platform available. The tools were ugly, slow, and built for institutions, not for the mobile-first, digitally native generation Li had spent a decade building products for at Tencent. He left in 2008, spent two years preparing, and formally incorporated Futu in Hong Kong in October 2012. The founding insight was the same one that later made [[Robinhood]] a phenomenon in the US: there was a massive underserved market of young, tech-savvy retail investors being ignored by incumbents built for boomers and institutions
- 2012-2015: Three years of building with no brokerage revenue. This is the period Futu's SEC filings describe as "continuously improving our platform and technology infrastructure." Li built Futubull as a native mobile app with social features — embedded community discussion, KOL connectivity, real-time data — bringing [[Tencent]]'s DNA (social + mobile) into financial services. The bet was that a brokerage could be a social network, not just a transaction terminal. [[Tencent]] led the early funding, both as a strategic investor (Li's former employer backing a former exec) and because the social-brokerage thesis aligned with Tencent's broader platform strategy
- 2015-2018: Growth ignites. Futubull catches the wave of Chinese retail investors wanting access to US and HK stocks. By December 2017, Cash App-style virality: 7M users, #1 finance app in Hong Kong. In 2018, Futu launches Moomoo — a separate brand for US/international markets, headquartered in Palo Alto. This is prescient: building the international brand *before* being forced to need it. Revenue starts scaling as the platform adds margin lending (the high-margin interest income engine that would later become 48% of revenue)
- 2019: IPO on NASDAQ in March, raising $90M at a modest valuation. The ticker was initially FHL, later changed to FUTU. The listing gave Futu something critical for a brokerage: US regulatory legitimacy (FINRA/SEC registered) and a NASDAQ listing that Chinese tech investors viewed as a seal of quality. Stock opened around $14, finished the year at $44 — a 3x in 9 months as investors discovered the growth story
- 2020 (breakout): COVID transforms retail trading globally. The same dynamic that drove [[Robinhood]]'s explosion in the US plays out across Asia: locked-down young people discover stock trading on their phones. Futu's revenue goes from $133M (2019) to $345M (2020), funded accounts from ~280K to 529K. Stock goes from $10 to $47 — a 343% annual return. Li's Tencent-era bet on mobile-first, social-native brokerage is fully validated
- 2021 (peak and cliff): Stock peaks at $186.60 in February during the Chinese tech/retail trading frenzy. Revenue nearly triples to $988M. Funded accounts hit 1.27M. But then Beijing launches its tech crackdown — [[Didi]] delisting, [[Ant Group]] IPO killed, overseas listing restrictions. Futu is exactly the kind of company regulators hate: a Chinese-founded platform helping mainland investors access foreign markets, listed in the US, operating in a gray zone. The CSRC begins "inquiries." Stock crashes from $186 to $42 by year-end — a 77% decline while the underlying business grew 186%
- 2022 (the kill shot and the pivot): In late 2022, the CSRC orders Futu and [[Tiger Brokers]] to stop accepting new mainland Chinese customers entirely. Apps pulled from mainland app stores. Existing clients can trade but can't add new capital. This is an existential moment: Futu was built to serve Chinese investors accessing global markets, and Beijing just closed that door. Stock bottoms at $23.83. But the 2018 decision to build Moomoo as a separate international brand now saves the company. Li pivots hard: Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Canada. Each market gets localized product (Malay-language AI tools, local regulatory compliance). The forced international expansion begins
- 2023-2024: The pivot works. International markets fill the China gap and then some. Funded accounts go from 1.57M to 2.41M — all organic growth from markets that aren't China. Singapore becomes #1 or #2 market. Malaysia adds seven consecutive quarters of rapid share gains. US accounts grow at "high double digits." Revenue recovers from the 2022 trough ($768M) back to $1.55B by 2024. Net margins hold at 40%. The stock triples from the $23 bottom to ~$80. Nobody is paying attention — this is a "Chinese crackdown victim" that quietly rebuilt itself as a genuinely global brokerage
- 2025 (new ATH): The breakout that validates the pivot. Revenue hits $2.44B TTM. Gross margins expand to 88%. Operating margins hit 61%. Net margins cross 50% — software-tier economics on a financial services business. Funded accounts reach 3.13M, client assets hit HK$1.24T ($159B). Stock hits new all-time high of $199.04 in October — *surpassing* the 2021 peak that was built on the China thesis. The irony: the company is worth more without China than it was with it. The CSRC ban forced diversification that made Futu a better, more defensible business. Crypto trading volume surges 161% QoQ. $800M buyback program authorized through 2027

The arc: frustrated Tencent engineer → mobile-first HK brokerage → COVID-era explosion → Chinese regulatory kill shot → forced international pivot → new ATH on a stronger, diversified foundation. The company that Beijing tried to destroy is now worth more than it was when Beijing loved it.

## Geographic footprint

| Market | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Hong Kong]] | Core market | Leading new client additions for 4 consecutive quarters. Benefits from FINI IPO regime. 20+ licenses. |
| [[United States]] | Growing | Moomoo Financial Inc. (Palo Alto). New funded accounts grew "high double digits" sequentially in Q3 2025. Options trading expanding. |
| [[Singapore]] | #1 or #2 | DAU advantage widening vs peers. Steady sequential growth. |
| [[Malaysia]] | Rapid growth | 7 quarters of "rapid market share expansion." Bursa derivatives launched. Malay language AI tools. |
| [[Australia]] | Licensed | AFSL holder. Regulated by ASIC. |
| [[Japan]] | Licensed | FIBO license. Regulated by FSA. |
| [[Canada]] | Licensed | CIRO/CIPF member. |
| [[China]] (mainland) | Blocked | CSRC ordered Futu to stop accepting new mainland customers in late 2022. Existing clients can trade but can't add new capital. Apps pulled from mainland. |

China risk is the elephant in the room. Futu was founded to serve Chinese investors accessing global markets. The CSRC ban forced a pivot to international expansion â€" which has actually worked remarkably well (28.2M users, 3.1M funded accounts across 7+ markets). But [[Tencent]] remains the largest investor, and geopolitical/regulatory risk from [[China]] hasn't disappeared.

## Competitive landscape

| Peer | Market cap | Geography focus | Key differentiator |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| [[Robinhood]] (HOOD) | ~$50B | US-centric | Simplest UX, crypto-native, PFOF model |
| [[Interactive Brokers]] (IBKR) | ~$80B | Global | Deepest product set, professional/institutional |
| [[Charles Schwab]] (SCHW) | ~$150B | US-centric | Full-service, advisory, banking |
| [[Tiger Brokers]] (TIGR) | ~$3B | Asia-Pacific | Direct competitor, similar model, smaller |
| Futu (FUTU) | $21.6B | Asia-Pacific + US | Best mobile UX in Asia, social features, Tencent DNA |

Revenue per funded account: ~6Ã- Robinhood's. Futu monetizes far better despite smaller user base â€" higher ARPU clients (Asia-Pacific investors tend to trade more actively and use margin).

[[Goldman Sachs]] upgraded FUTU to Buy (Feb 1, 2026).

## Investment case

### Bull case ðŸ'
- Explosive growth at scale â€" 86% revenue growth, 144% net income growth, with expanding margins
- Incredible profitability â€" 88% gross margins, 61% operating margins, 50% net margins. These are software economics on a financial services business
- Cheap valuation â€" 17Ã- trailing P/E, 10.7Ã- forward P/E for a company growing 80%+ YoY. Compare to [[Robinhood]] at higher multiples with lower margins
- Multi-market optionality â€" already licensed in 7+ markets, each a growth vector. Malaysia in early innings. US accelerating.
- Interest income base â€" $1.5B+ annualized in interest income provides a recurring floor even if trading volumes dip
- Massive TAM â€" Asia-Pacific retail investing is underpenetrated vs. US. Rising middle class, generational wealth transfer, digitization of finance.
- $800M buyback authorized through 2027

### Bear case ðŸ»
- China regulatory risk â€" CSRC already blocked mainland expansion. Further crackdowns on [[Tencent]] or cross-border finance could impact the stock. VIE structure adds complexity.
- Tencent overhang â€" [[Tencent]] has been divesting positions. A large Tencent sale could pressure the stock.
- Market-dependent revenue â€" trading volumes are cyclical. A prolonged bear market would crush commissions and margin lending
- Interest rate sensitivity â€" falling rates compress NIM on margin financing
- US-China geopolitical risk â€" NASDAQ-listed Chinese company faces delisting risk (though PCAOB audit access resolved this partially)
- Competition â€" [[Robinhood]] expanding internationally, [[Interactive Brokers]] already global, local players in each market

---

## Key metrics to watch
- Funded account growth (leading indicator)
- Client asset inflows (quality of growth)
- Blended commission rate (compression vs volume)
- Margin financing balance (interest income driver)
- Geographic revenue mix (diversification away from HK)
- Crypto trading volume (emerging growth vector)
- Q4 2025 earnings: Mar 12, 2026
