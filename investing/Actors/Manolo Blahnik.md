## Investment case

Bull:
- Founder still active as creative director — rare for a 55-year-old brand
- Zero debt, strong liquidity — self-funded growth
- DTC pivot will structurally improve margins once transition completes
- Like-for-like DTC growth of 14% (25% online) shows strategy is working
- No outside investors — no pressure to compromise brand
- Manufacturing in-house (Re Marcello factory) = quality moat

Bear:
- Revenue dropped 19% in 2024 — DTC gains not yet offsetting wholesale losses
- EBITDA fell 61% — margin pressure during transition
- Succession risk — Manolo Blahnik is 82, brand identity is deeply personal
- Small scale (€86M revenue) vs luxury conglomerate competitors
- Wholesale reduction is intentional but irreversible — if DTC stalls, limited fallback
- [[China]] expansion (2026) carries execution risk
