## Scandals and controversies

### Australia tax leaks (2020-2024)

**The biggest scandal.** A PwC tax partner shared confidential Australian government tax reform plans with other partners and staff, who used the information to win private sector work.

**Timeline:**
- 2020 — Referred to Tax Practitioners Board
- Dec 2022 — Partner deregistered
- 2023 — Scandal becomes public; CEO and senior leaders resign
- Aug 2023 — Government increases tax advisor misconduct fines from A$7.8M to A$780M
- Oct 2024 — Australian Federal Police raid PwC Sydney headquarters

Senate inquiry concluded PwC engaged in "deliberate strategy over many years to cover up" the breach. Initial claim that it was one individual acting alone was contradicted by later revelations showing widespread involvement including CEO.

**Consequences:**
- 338 redundancies (Nov 2023)
- 366 additional redundancies (Mar 2024)
- 10+ ongoing investigations by mid-2023
- Parliamentary inquiry recommended forcing global consulting firms to operationally separate audit businesses

### China/Evergrande (2024)

**Banned 6 months** in China + fined ¥400M (~€51M). PwC audited [[Evergrande]] for 14 years, giving clean bills of health. Chinese regulators found PwC staff "hid fraudulent practices" and failed to maintain "professional scepticism."

### Russia sanctions evasion (2022-2023)

**Cyprus Confidential leaks** revealed PwC's Cyprus unit helped Russian oligarchs shuffle wealth and evade sanctions after Russia's Ukraine invasion:
- Helped Alexey Mordashov transfer $1.4B investment to evade EU sanctions
- Assisted two oligarchs "instrumental to waging Russia's war" hide $100M

### UK audit failures

- **Galliford Try/Kier** (2022) — Fined £5M for failing to adequately challenge revenue/cost recognition
- **Babcock International** — Fined £5.6M for audit failures

### Brazil/Americanas (2023)

Approved Americanas (AMER3) balance sheets with ~US$4B in accounting inconsistencies, causing stock volatility and shareholder losses.
