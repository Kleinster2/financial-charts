## Models

| Model | Parameters | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Mistral 7B | 7B | Punched above weight |
| Mixtral 8x7B | 47B (MoE) | Mixture of experts |
| Mistral Large | ~70B+ | Flagship |
| Mistral Medium | — | API tier |
| Codestral | — | Code-focused |

Open-weight approach: Release model weights publicly (unlike OpenAI/Anthropic). Enables enterprise self-hosting.

## Infrastructure — vertical integration

Mistral is shifting from pure model lab to vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider:

| Facility | Investment | Partner | Capacity | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| [[France]] (home) | — | — | — | Operational |
| [[Sweden]] (Borlänge) | €1.2B ($1.4B) | [[EcoDataCenter]] | 23 MW, [[NVIDIA]] Vera Rubin GPUs | 2027 |

The Sweden facility is Mistral's first infrastructure investment outside France. Dual-purpose: enterprise inference by day, model training by night. Projected >€2B revenue over 5 years.

CEO Mensch chose Sweden for clean energy access and low-carbon footprint. The move mirrors US hyperscaler vertical integration but with a European sovereignty pitch.

## Enterprise customers

| Customer | Sector | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [[BNP Paribas]] | Banking | 3-year deal (Feb 2026), ~100 use cases, investor |
| [[ASML]] | Semiconductors | Lead Series C investor + customer |
| [[TotalEnergies]] | Energy | Enterprise deployment |
| [[HSBC]] | Banking | Enterprise deployment |
| [[Stellantis]] | Automotive | Enterprise deployment |

Government partnerships: [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Greece]], [[Estonia]].

---

## Microsoft relationship

Strategic partnership:
- Azure distribution deal
- Microsoft investment (~$15M + Azure credits)
- Similar to Microsoft-OpenAI but smaller
- Gives Microsoft European AI hedge

Tension: Microsoft backs both OpenAI AND Mistral — hedging bets.

## Competitive position

| Lab | Geography | Strategy | Valuation | ~2025 Revenue |
|-----|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| [[OpenAI]] | USA | Closed, consumer | $300B+ | ~$20B |
| [[Anthropic]] | USA | Closed, enterprise | $60B+ | ~$10B |
| Mistral | [[France]] | Open-weight + infra | €11.7B | $400M+ ARR |
| [[Cohere]] | [[Canada]] | Enterprise | ~$5B | — |

Mistral is largest European AI lab. $400M ARR is ~25x smaller than OpenAI but growing 20x YoY — fastest in the sector. Revenue target >$1B by end of 2026.

## European AI sovereignty

[[France]] backing Mistral:
- BPI [[France]] investment
- Macron government support
- "European champion" narrative
- GDPR-compliant hosting angle

Challenge: Compute disadvantage vs US labs. Relies on cloud providers.

---

## Open-weight economics

Bull case:
- Enterprise wants self-hosting (data privacy)
- Fine-tuning on proprietary data
- Regulatory compliance ([[EU]])
- Not paying API margins

Bear case:
- Open weights = commoditization
- Can't capture full value
- US labs may follow ([[Llama]] already open)
- Compute cost still high

---

## India expansion (Feb 18, 2026)

Mensch announced at [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]] that Mistral plans to open its first India office in 2026. India is a major expansion target as global tech giants compete for the market.

At the same event, Mensch told CNBC that >50% of current enterprise software could be replaced by AI — the most aggressive public estimate from an AI lab CEO. This aligns with the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] narrative.

---

## Openness thesis (Feb 18, 2026)

Bloomberg interview: Mensch argued AI dominance hinges on openness, not geography. The competition is between open vs. closed systems, not US vs. Europe. He also reiterated that claims of Chinese AI lagging are a "fairy tale" (first said at Davos, Jan 2026 — referring to [[DeepSeek]], [[Moonshot AI]] and others).

Mistral targeting $1B capex in 2026 alongside $1B revenue target — vertical integration into compute infrastructure. Planned Mistral Compute platform launching in 2026 with [[NVIDIA]]'s 18,000 Grace Blackwell chips at nuclear-powered Swedish facility ([[EcoDataCenter]]).

---

## IPO outlook

Mensch said an IPO is not necessary in 2026 — debt financing available. But on the long-term radar. [[OpenAI]] and [[Anthropic]] both targeting 2026 IPOs.
