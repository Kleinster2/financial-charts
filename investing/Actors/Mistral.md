## Competitive position

| Lab | Geography | Strategy | Valuation |
|-----|-----------|----------|-----------|
| [[OpenAI]] | USA | Closed, consumer | $150B+ |
| [[Anthropic]] | USA | Closed, enterprise | $60B+ |
| **Mistral** | France | Open-weight | ~$6B |
| [[Cohere]] | Canada | Enterprise | ~$5B |

Mistral is largest European AI lab. Open-weight = enterprise/self-hosting niche.

## European AI sovereignty

**France backing Mistral:**
- BPI France investment
- Macron government support
- "European champion" narrative
- GDPR-compliant hosting angle

**Challenge:** Compute disadvantage vs US labs. Relies on cloud providers.

---

## Open-weight economics

**Bull case:**
- Enterprise wants self-hosting (data privacy)
- Fine-tuning on proprietary data
- Regulatory compliance (EU)
- Not paying API margins

**Bear case:**
- Open weights = commoditization
- Can't capture full value
- US labs may follow (Llama already open)
- Compute cost still high
