## Strategic vision

Rowan transformed Apollo from a distressed-debt/PE firm into a credit-and-insurance powerhouse. Core thesis:

**1. Credit > PE:**
- [[Banks]] now provide <20% of debt capital (down from ~50% pre-2008)
- Apollo fills the gap with $500B+ credit AUM
- Investment-grade private credit is the fastest-growing segment

**2. [[Insurance]] as permanent capital:**
- Athene merger (Jan 2022, ~$11B all-stock transaction) created aligned permanent capital vehicle
- Retirement liabilities = long-duration, low-cost capital
- Replaced traditional PE fund model (closed-end, 15-20% return hurdle) with spread-based income
- Athene now largest US fixed-annuity platform

**3. $1.5T AUM target:**
- AUM: $40B (2008) → $700B (2024) → $908B (late 2025)
- Retirement services + credit origination as compounding flywheel

**4. [[Private markets]] revolution:**
- "Traditional investing model is broken" (Sep 2025)
- Pushing private credit to retail/high-net-worth (European product platform launching)
- Expects more market makers in private credit trading (Dec 2025)

## Macro views

**On rates (Dec 2025):** No need for further Fed rate cuts. Longer-term market forces are inflationary.

**On Japan (Feb 2026):** "There's a new swagger" in Japan. Generational change across corporate governance, interest rates, and government policy. Japan is "the first of the Western democracies to face real aging, retirement, and high levels of government debt" — making it a template. Large long-term capital needs: manufacturing, energy, AI/data, infrastructure — "the scale is beyond anything we can comprehend... measured in trillions."

**On risk (Feb 2026):** In normal times, 95% of outcomes fall between "two sidelines." Today, only 70-75% do. What's between the sidelines is "amazing" — capital cycle, growth, employment, inflation coming down. But increased tail risk from geopolitics, government deficits, rate volatility. "For the first time in a very long time, we are trying to address outcomes that perhaps could occur outside of what we normally see."

## Compensation structure

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base salary | $100K |
| Total comp (2023) | ~$321K (salary + benefits) |
| No bonuses/options | Aligned via ownership |
| APO shares owned | ~$3.9B worth |

Notably low formal compensation — wealth creation comes entirely through ownership stake. Total comp well below peer average ($13.[[3M]] for similar-size firms).
