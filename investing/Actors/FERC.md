## Why FERC matters for investors

FERC controls the rules that determine how fast new power plants and data centers can connect to the grid. Its decisions directly affect the [[Power infrastructure bottleneck]] thesis:

- **Interconnection queue reform** — FERC Order 2023 (finalized 2024) aims to reduce 5-12 year interconnection delays. Implementation ongoing.
- **[[Capacity market]] oversight** — approves [[PJM]] and other [[Regional Transmission Organization|RTO]] auction designs, including the proposed emergency auction (Sep 2026)
- **Rate setting** — determines cost allocation for grid upgrades needed for [[Data Centers|data center]] demand
- **April 2026** — expected next round of reforms targeting queue backlog
