### Fueled by Ramen

Founded 1996 by John Janick and Vinnie Fiorello (Less Than Jake drummer) at University of Florida. Became the definitive pop-punk/alt label of the 2000s-2010s. Now operates under Elektra Music Group. Signed Twenty One Pilots in 2012 — their *Blurryface* (2015) became the first album with every track certified gold+. Current roster also includes A Day to Remember, One OK Rock, Meet Me @ the Altar.

## Catalog

WMG's deep catalog includes Fleetwood Mac, Madonna, Led Zeppelin, Prince, The Doors, Bee Gees, Phil Collins. Kyncl's "Marvel for Music" strategy = treat these as IP franchises for sync, AI licensing, superfan experiences.

## Ownership structure

| Owner | Stake | Control |
|-------|-------|---------|
| [[Access Industries]] | 72% economic | 98% voting |
| Public | 28% | 2% voting |

Blavatnik took WMG private in 2011 for $3.3B, re-IPO'd June 2020 at $25/share. Dual-class structure means public shareholders have essentially zero governance power.

---

## AI strategy

WMG has pivoted from "AI panic" to "AI integration":
- **Suno settlement** (late 2025): Resolved copyright lawsuit, formed partnership for licensed AI music creation launching 2026
- **Udio deal**: Similar settlement → licensing partnership
- **Kyncl's non-negotiables**: Artists must be compensated for use of their style/voice. "Digital twin" licensing as new revenue stream
- Industry benchmark: [[Universal Music Group]]–NVIDIA "Music Flamingo" partnership for ethical AI generation

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Share | Valuation | Edge |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|
| [[Universal Music Group]] | ~35% | ~14x fwd EBITDA | Scale, #1 catalog, Taylor Swift |
| [[Sony]] Music | ~22% | Part of Sony conglomerate | Diversified, gaming sync |
| **WMG** | ~16% | ~11x fwd EBITDA | Value gap, margin expansion story |

Morgan Stanley upgraded WMG to Overweight (Dec 2025), PT $37 — citing accelerated DSP payments from renegotiated royalty terms. Wolfe Research "Outperform" with PT $36 — core thesis is margin expansion: $200M cost savings target in 2026, scaling to $300M by 2027.

---

## Key dynamics

- **DSP pricing tailwind**: Spotify hiking to $13.99 Premium in 2026 = "found money" for labels
- **Artist-centric royalties**: WMG and UMG pushing models that prioritize professional artists over AI slop / white noise. Winner-take-most for major labels
- **Superfan monetization**: Goldman projects $4B+ industry upside from exclusive digital access, early vinyl, virtual backstage. WMG building D2C infrastructure
- **$200M restructuring savings** in 2026 — aggressive reorg under Kyncl

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Value gap vs UMG (11x vs 14x EBITDA) closing as margins improve
- Streaming ARPU growth > subscriber growth era — benefits all labels
- AI licensing = new revenue stream (Suno, Udio deals done)
- Superfan D2C app captures first-party data + higher margins
- $200-300M cost savings 2026-27
- Catalog is forever (Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Madonna)
- Kyncl's digital DNA (YouTube veteran)

**Bear:**
- Dual-class = zero governance rights for public holders
- Smallest of Big Three — subscale in some markets
- $4B debt load limits M&A flexibility
- 23% profit decline in FY2025 (restructuring pain)
- Blavatnik could take private again at unfavorable price
- Short-form video platforms resisting licensing fees (TikTok precedent)
