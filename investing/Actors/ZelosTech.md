# ZelosTech

**ZelosTech** is a Chinese L4 autonomous delivery vehicle company — the first in the robovan segment to cross unicorn status (~$1.4B valuation as of Feb 2026). Founded in 2021 by Qi Kong (ex-JD.com chief scientist of autonomous driving) and incubated by Blue Lake Capital, the company builds standardized robovans for urban last-mile and intra-city logistics. Following its January 2026 merger with [[Cainiao]]'s autonomous vehicle unit, ZelosTech operates a combined fleet of 20,000+ vehicles across 300+ cities in 10+ countries.

## Synopsis

The first unicorn in L4 autonomous logistics vehicles, and the clearest proof point that [[Autonomous Last-Mile Delivery|robovans will scale before robotaxis]]. ZelosTech's fleet grew from 200 units (2023) to 2,000 (2024) to 20,000 (early 2026 post-Cainiao merger) — 10x annual compounding that no robotaxi company has matched. The unit economics are already working: operating breakeven ex-R&D, with full breakeven targeted at 50,000 deployed units. Per-parcel last-mile cost drops from ~RMB 0.2 to ~RMB 0.1 ($0.03 to $0.015), halving the cost of human delivery. The Cainiao merger is the textbook move — absorbing [[Alibaba]]'s logistics demand channel while Cainiao steps back from hardware to focus on supply chain services. The bull case: China's urban delivery market is RMB 1.5T (~$209B) with 20M vehicles on the road, and ZelosTech's standardized L4 product is the leading candidate to automate it. The bear case: competition is heating up (QCraft, Desay SV, Haomo AI entering the space), and the path from 20,000 to 50,000 units requires scaling manufacturing, not just software.

## Evolution

The story of ZelosTech is the story of L4 autonomous driving finding its real market — not robotaxis for consumers, but robovans for logistics.

- **2021 — Founding.** Blue Lake Capital incubated the company around a business idea developed with Qi Kong, who had been chief scientist and head of autonomous driving at [[JD.com]]. The thesis: L4 robotaxis were overfunded and under-monetized, but urban logistics — low-speed, fixed routes, B2B customers with clear cost pain — was ripe for commercialization. Started as a pure software developer. Blue Lake led the Angel round (Jan 2022).

- **2022-2023 — Product development and early deployment.** Built the Z-series product line, expanding cargo capacity from 1.7 cbm (Z1) to 5 cbm (Z5). The Z5 required building a proprietary chassis after suppliers refused to develop one. Hardware specialists grew to ~50% of R&D headcount — the team recognized that pure-algorithm approaches couldn't achieve stable L4 commercialization. Deployed ~200 vehicles by end of 2023, primarily serving small business franchisees for logistics brands like YTO Express, SF Express, CR Pharmaceutical, and Mengniu Dairy. Over 90% of customers are SMBs.

- **2024 — Series A and B, 10x scaling.** Closed a $100M Series A led by [[Meituan]] (Feb 2024), with participation from Baidu Ventures, Unicorn Capital Partners, and others. Then a ~$300M Series B (mid-2024) with Blue Lake co-leading, followed by a $100M Series B1 (Nov 2024) co-led by Blue Lake and CDH BAIFU. Fleet scaled from 200 to 2,000 units. Expanded to 50+ Chinese cities and entered Singapore.

- **2025 — International expansion and China Post deal.** Expanded to the UAE, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Signed a 7,000-unit order with China Post (Oct 2025) — the largest single order in the robovan space. This contract alone would more than triple the pre-merger fleet.

- **Jan 2026 — Cainiao merger.** [[Cainiao]] ([[Alibaba]]'s logistics arm) folded its autonomous driving unit into ZelosTech through a combination of asset injection and cash investment. Cainiao became a shareholder, contributed its ~18,000-vehicle fleet, and licensed its brand to ZelosTech — but exited hardware manufacturing to focus on supply chain services. Combined fleet jumped to 20,000+. Both brands operate simultaneously.

- **Feb 2026 — $300M+ raise, unicorn.** Closed sixth funding round exceeding $300M, pushing valuation past RMB 10B (~$1.4B). First L4 robovan unicorn.

## Insights

- **Logistics before passengers is the right sequencing.** Fixed routes, low speed, B2B customers who measure ROI in cost-per-parcel — all reduce the L4 problem to something solvable with current tech. Robotaxis need to handle every edge case a human driver encounters. Robovans need to handle delivery routes.
- **The Cainiao merger is the demand-channel acquisition.** Tech company absorbs a guaranteed deployment pipeline. Cainiao gets equity upside without hardware risk. This is the model for how autonomous logistics scales: tech maker + logistics platform merger.
- **10x annual fleet growth is the real signal.** 200 to 2,000 to 20,000. No robotaxi company has achieved this compounding. The constraint shifts from technology to manufacturing.
- **China's labor economics make this work faster.** RMB 0.1/parcel is unbeatable by human delivery. As labor costs rise and recruitment gets harder in logistics, the replacement curve accelerates.
