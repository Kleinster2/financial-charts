**Citadel Securities** — Largest US market maker. Executes ~25% of all US equity volume. Controversial payment for order flow (PFOF) relationships with retail brokers.

## Why Citadel Securities matters

Citadel is the plumbing of US equity markets:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US equity volume | ~25% |
| Options volume | ~40% |
| Retail order flow | Largest buyer |
| Role | Market maker, liquidity provider |

**Note:** Citadel Securities ≠ Citadel hedge fund (separate entities, same founder Ken Griffin).

## Payment for order flow (PFOF)

**How it works:**
1. [[Robinhood]] user places order
2. Robinhood routes to Citadel Securities
3. Citadel pays Robinhood for the order
4. Citadel executes, captures spread

**Why Citadel pays:**
- Retail orders are "uninformed" (not hedge funds)
- Less adverse selection risk
- Can profit from bid-ask spread

**Controversy:**
- Conflict of interest for brokers
- Are retail investors getting best execution?
- Banned in UK, Canada, Australia
- SEC has considered banning

## GameStop controversy (2021)

**What happened:**
- Robinhood halted GameStop buying during squeeze
- Citadel Securities is Robinhood's largest PFOF partner
- Citadel hedge fund had exposure to shorts
- Conspiracy theories exploded

**Reality:**
- Robinhood had capital/clearing issues
- No evidence of Citadel coordination
- But optics were terrible
- Led to Congressional hearings

## Market structure role

| Function | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Liquidity provision | Tighter spreads |
| Price improvement | Claims to beat NBBO |
| Risk absorption | Takes other side of trades |
| Technology | Fastest execution |

**Argument for:** Citadel makes markets more efficient, tighter spreads benefit everyone.

**Argument against:** Opacity, conflicts, concentration of power.
