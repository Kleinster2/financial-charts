## Investment case

- Dermatological Beauty growing +16%, 28% margins

- China returning to growth
- CeraVe/La Roche-Posay social media tailwinds

**Bear:**
- Growth decelerating (5% from 11%)

- Aēsop acquisition expensive, integration ongoing
- Kering Beauté €4B acquisition execution risk
- Beauty cycle could slow with consumer weakness
