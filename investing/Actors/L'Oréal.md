## M&A strategy

| Acquisition/Investment | Price | Year | Rationale |
|----------------------|-------|------|-----------|
| **[[Galderma]] stake → 20%** | Undisclosed | 2026 | Aesthetics/dermatology; 2 board seats |
| **Kering Beauté** (Creed) | ~€4B | 2025 | Ultra-luxury fragrance |
| Aēsop | $2.5B | 2023 | Premium skincare |
| Medik8 | Undisclosed | 2025 | British premium skincare |
| Color Wow | Undisclosed | 2025 | Prestige haircare |

**Galderma (Feb 2026):** Increased stake from 10% to 20%, closed Feb 10 2026. Two non-independent board candidates to be nominated. Signals deeper push into injectable aesthetics — the fastest-growing segment of the broader beauty/dermatology market.

**Fragrance + skincare = fastest-growing categories.** L'Oréal is buying aggressively into both while [[Estée Lauder]] retrenches.

## Investment case

**2026 outlook:** Management optimistic on global beauty market, confident in outperformance — guided for "another year of growth in sales and profit." Earnings call Feb 13 2026.

**Bull:**
- 20.2% operating margin at €44B scale — record, expanding for third straight year
- Galderma 20% stake — entering injectable aesthetics, fastest-growing adjacent market
- E-commerce >30% of sales, growing double-digit — channel mix shift
- Emerging markets +10% LFL — diversification away from stagnant North Asia
- Professional Products +7.5% — fastest-growing division, highest margin improvement
- Net cash flow €7.2B (+7.8%) — strong capital returns capacity

**Bear:**
- LFL growth decelerating (11% → 5% → 4%) — approaching mature growth rates
- North Asia +0.5% — [[China]] headwinds not resolving
- Premium valuation (~30x earnings)
- Galderma execution risk — 20% minority stake limits strategic control
- FX headwinds turned reported growth to +1.3% vs +4.0% LFL
- Beauty cycle could slow with consumer weakness
