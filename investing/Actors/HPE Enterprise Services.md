## Why HPE ES mattered

The EDS legacy in HP's portfolio:

- **EDS heritage**: Ross Perot's 1962 outsourcing pioneer
- **Scale at acquisition**: $22B revenue, 300,000 employees, 64 countries
- **Value destruction**: HP wrote off $8B in 2012 (paid $13.9B in 2008)
- **DXC merger**: 50.1% of combined entity

## Value destruction
