## Market position

- ~90% of China's mobile office market
- 85%+ of SOEs are WPS clients
- 50%+ of China's Fortune 500 companies
- All five national commercial banks
- Government, finance, telecom are core institutional verticals

Signal event (Oct 2025): China's [[MOFCOM]] issued rare-earth export control announcements exclusively in WPS format — not Word or PDF. First time a major ministry used WPS-only format for official trade policy documents. Shares surged 18% in one day on the signal that WPS is becoming the designated government document format.

## Xinchuang tailwind

[[Xinchuang]] (信创 / IT Application Innovation) — Document 79 mandates replacement of foreign software in SOEs and critical sectors by 2027. Creates captive demand for WPS:
- Compatible with domestic chips and Linux distros ([[UOS]], [[Kylin]])
- WPS AI Government Edition for Xinchuang deployment
- Adaptation tools for domestic databases
- Government procurement increasingly WPS-first

---

## AI integration

Domestic: Integrated [[DeepSeek]] R1 models across WPS AI (Feb 2025). Proprietary "Wensheng" (文生) text-to-image model for presentations. Government-specific AI model.

International: WPS AI built on [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude]] 3 via [[Amazon]] Bedrock. Uses Claude's 200K-token context window for content generation.

Monetization: AI billing surged 300%+ YoY to CNY 474M — driving paid user conversion.

---

## International expansion

Three-prong strategy:
1. Emerging markets (India, Indonesia): free tier + ads + paid membership
2. Western markets: premium services (PDF-to-Word conversion), higher subscription rates
3. Belt and Road countries: B2B/enterprise focus (Saudi Arabia, Oman, Serbia, Vietnam)

FPT partnership (Jan 2026): Strategic MoU with [[Vietnam]]'s [[FPT Corporation]] — global delivery partner for WPS 365 implementation in Vietnam and Japan.

Overseas: 200M+ MADs, but only CNY 218M revenue (~4.25% of total). Massive user base, early-stage monetization.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Xinchuang mandate creates captive government/SOE demand through 2027+

- International expansion barely started (4% of revenue)

Bear:
- ~80x P/E — priced for perfection
- Institutional licensing declining (-8.6%) as cloud cannibalizes
