**Intel Foundry Services (IFS)** — Intel's attempt to pivot from IDM to competitive third-party foundry.

## Core thesis

IFS is an existential pivot masquerading as a growth initiative. Success requires Intel to fix manufacturing, build customer-service culture, and compete with [[TSMC]] — simultaneously. High-uncertainty, policy-dependent bet.

## Key concepts

- [[Execution risk in foundries]] — very high for IFS
- [[CHIPS Act]] — largest recipient ($8.5B + $11B loans)

## Open questions

- [[Will Intel Foundry Services succeed]] — the central uncertainty
- [[How durable is TSMC's moat]] — IFS success requires TSMC weakness

## The challenge

- Lost process leadership ~2016-2018
- No track record with external customers
- Cultural shift required: product-centric → service-centric
- Must serve internal demand AND win external customers

## The opportunity

- Only credible U.S.-headquartered advanced foundry
- Geopolitical tailwinds favor domestic capacity
- Massive government support provides runway

## What to watch

- ~~Intel 18A timeline and yields~~ — **18A reached HVM Dec 2025** (5N4Y complete)
- First major external customer win
- Ohio/Arizona fab ramp
- Activist investor activity

## Recent developments (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)

**Wins:**
- 18A reached high-volume manufacturing — first to combine RibbonFET (GAA) + PowerVia
- Panther Lake launching Jan 2026 (lead 18A product)
- **Microsoft Maia 2** — reportedly going to Intel 18A/18A-P (Dec 2025). If confirmed, first major hyperscaler win and US-based supply chain validation
- Amazon custom chips as customers
- US govt converted CHIPS grants to 9.9% equity stake
- $3B DoD "Secure Enclave" contract
- Stock up 86% YTD

**Setbacks:**
- **NVIDIA halted 18A testing** (Reuters) — evaluated but stopped moving forward
- Operating loss $9.5B for FY2025

**Maia 2 significance**: Microsoft seeking US-based foundry capacity not exposed to TSMC constraints. If deal closes, validates 18A for external customers and opens door to other hyperscalers.

## TSMC overflow momentum (Jan 2026)

TSMC's CoWoS bottleneck is creating opportunities for Intel:

**New customer interest:**

| Customer | Product | Intel offering | Status |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| [[Google]] | TPU v9 (2027) | EMIB packaging | Exploring |
| [[Apple]] | Entry-level M-series (2027) | 18A process | Reported interest |
| [[Broadcom]] | Custom ASICs | Foundry services | Orders placed |
| [[Microsoft]] | Maia 2 | 18A/18A-P | Reported |

**Why now:**
- TSMC CoWoS capacity locked up (NVIDIA has >50% through 2027)
- Google cut TPU production target 4M → 3M due to CoWoS constraint
- Hyperscalers seeking alternatives

**Intel capacity expansion (New Mexico):**

| Capability | Expansion |
|------------|-----------|
| EMIB packaging | +30% capacity |
| Foveros 3D | +150% capacity |

**The NVIDIA signal:** NVIDIA reviewed Intel facilities but passed — shows Intel is being evaluated seriously, even if not chosen by all.

## Geographic retreat

**Magdeburg cancelled (Dec 2025)**: €30B Germany fab suspended indefinitely. Cited need to stabilize balance sheet and focus on 18A success in US. Construction halted mid-2025.

EU "digital sovereignty" setback — Germany was betting on Intel for domestic advanced logic. Now reliant on [[TSMC]] Dresden (mature nodes) and [[Rapidus]] partnerships.

Strategic read: Intel prioritizing US operations where [[CHIPS Act]] support is locked in. Europe was a stretch.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Foundry share | <5% |
| Key node | Intel 18A — **reached HVM** (Dec 2025) |
| CHIPS Act | $8.5B → **9.9% US govt equity stake** |
| DoD contract | **$3B "Secure Enclave"** |
| Total U.S. investment | $100B+ over 5 years |

## Market expectations

What consensus assumes (update when you see estimates):

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 18A timeline | Slipping | |
| External customers | None significant | |
| Foundry profitability | Years away | |
| Leadership | Uncertain post-Gelsinger | |

**Priced in:**
- IFS struggles, no near-term wins
- Continued cash burn
- Execution uncertainty

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- ~~18A on-schedule with good yields~~ **CONFIRMED: 18A HVM achieved Dec 2025**
- ~~Major external customer announcement~~ **EMERGING: Microsoft Maia 2 (unconfirmed)**
- Strategic clarity from new leadership
- Activist-driven spinoff

**Emerging catalysts:**
- Microsoft Maia 2 on 18A — would be first hyperscaler foundry win
- 18A-P (performance) and 18A-PT (3D Foveros Direct) variants coming
- 14A roadmap for future external adoption

*Market has low expectations — bar for positive surprise is low. 18A milestones and Maia 2 reports are starting to change narrative.*
