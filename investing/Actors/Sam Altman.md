**Sam Altman** — OpenAI CEO. Central figure in AI race, chip ambitions, nuclear energy investor.

---

## Why Altman matters for semis

Altman sits at the intersection of AI demand and infrastructure solutions:

| Role | Relevance |
|------|-----------|
| OpenAI CEO | Largest AI lab, massive GPU consumer |
| Chip venture rumors | $7T fab consortium (reported 2024) |
| [[Helion Energy]] chairman | $375M investment, fusion play |
| [[Oklo]] chairman | SMR fission play |
| Worldcoin | Orb hardware, custom chips |

**The pattern:** Altman invests in solving AI's bottlenecks — chips AND power.

## OpenAI

See [[OpenAI]] for company details.

**Altman's role:**
- Fired and rehired (Nov 2023 board drama)
- Consolidated control post-crisis
- Driving commercialization (ChatGPT, API, enterprise)
- For-profit transition (2024)

**Compute demands:**
- Microsoft partnership ($13B+)
- Largest NVIDIA customer (via Azure)
- Pushing for more capacity than available

---

## Nuclear energy investments

Altman is betting big on nuclear for AI power — both fission and fusion:

| Company | Technology | Altman's role | Investment |
|---------|------------|---------------|------------|
| [[Helion Energy]] | Fusion | Chairman (since 2015) | $375M (largest ever) |
| [[Oklo]] | Fission (SMR) | Chairman | Significant stake |

**Why both?**
- Fission (Oklo): Works, but slow to deploy
- Fusion (Helion): Doesn't work yet, but unlimited upside
- Hedging, or conviction that AI needs nuclear-scale power

**Helion-Microsoft deal:** Altman's Helion has PPA with Altman's partner Microsoft for 2028 fusion power.

> "Decreasing the cost of energy is one of the best ways to improve people's quality of lives." — Altman

## Chip ambitions

**$7T fab consortium (reported Jan 2024):**
- Altman reportedly seeking massive semiconductor investment
- Talked with UAE, Saudi sovereign wealth
- Goal: Break NVIDIA/TSMC bottleneck
- Status: Unclear, possibly abandoned or restructured

**Why it matters:**
- Signals AI labs feel supply-constrained
- Would compete with existing fabs
- Sovereign wealth interest in chip independence

---

## Political connections

- Regular White House access
- Testified to Congress on AI regulation
- Advocates for AI safety regulation (critics say: regulatory capture)
- Connected to Democratic establishment

**Contrast with Musk:** Altman more establishment, Musk more MAGA-aligned. Different policy influence vectors.

---

## Worldcoin / World

- Biometric identity project (iris scanning)
- Custom "Orb" hardware
- Chip demand for edge devices
- Controversial: privacy concerns, developing world targeting

---

## Board drama (Nov 2023)

- Fired by board over "not consistently candid"
- Microsoft offered him job
- Rehired within days after employee revolt
- Board restructured, Altman consolidated power

**Lesson:** Altman is OpenAI. Removal risk is low now.

---

## Risks / Considerations

- OpenAI burn rate enormous
- Competition from Anthropic, Google, xAI
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Chip venture may be vaporware
- Nuclear bets are long-term, speculative
- For-profit transition complications
