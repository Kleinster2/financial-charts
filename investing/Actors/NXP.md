**NXP [[Semiconductors]]** — Dutch semiconductor company. #2 in automotive (radar, V2X, ADAS), NFC/security leader. Survived Qualcomm acquisition attempt.

---

## Why NXP matters

NXP is the ADAS/connectivity specialist:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Auto semis | #2 globally |
| Radar/ADAS | Market leader |
| NFC/security | #1 globally |
| V2X | Leading position |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| [[Automotive]] | #2 globally (after [[Infineon]]) |
| [[Automotive]] radar | #1 |
| NFC | #1 globally |
| Secure elements | #1 |
| V2X (vehicle-to-everything) | Leader |

---

## Product portfolio

**[[Automotive]] (55% of revenue):**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| Radar processors | ADAS, autonomous |
| S32 MCUs | Vehicle compute |
| V2X | Vehicle communication |
| In-vehicle networking | CAN, Ethernet |

**Secure transactions:**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| NFC controllers | Contactless payments |
| Secure elements | Apple Pay, [[Google]] Pay |
| eSIM | Connected devices |
| Authentication | Access control |

---

## ADAS / autonomous focus

**Radar leadership:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Radar market share | #1 |
| Customers | Most major OEMs |
| Technology | 77GHz imaging radar |
| Trend | More radar per vehicle |

As ADAS advances → more NXP content per car.

## Qualcomm blocked deal (2018)

**$44B acquisition blocked by [[China]]:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Offer | $44B (largest semi deal ever) |
| Blocker | [[China]] antitrust (SAMR) |
| Context | [[US-China trade]] war beginning |
| Outcome | NXP remained independent |

See [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]].

**Post-block performance:**
- Stock initially dropped 8%
- Proved resilient standalone
- [[Automotive]] boom post-2020
- Now worth more than deal price

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Apple | NFC, secure elements |
| [[Automotive]] OEMs | Radar, MCUs, V2X |
| Tier 1s | Bosch, Continental |
| Payment networks | Secure transactions |

Apple relationship = recurring secure element revenue.

---

## Manufacturing

**Hybrid model:**

| Approach | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Fabless (advanced) | [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]] |
| Own fabs (mature) | Specialty nodes |
| Locations | Netherlands, US, [[Asia]] |

Less node-dependent than AI chips = own fabs viable for some products.

---

## Competitive position

| vs | NXP advantage | NXP disadvantage |
|----|---------------|------------------|
| [[Infineon]] | Radar, V2X, NFC | Power semis scale |
| [[STMicro]] | Connectivity, security | SiC, MEMS |
| [[Renesas]] | Radar, V2X | [[Japan]] relationships |
| Mobileye | Broader auto portfolio | Vision-specific |

NXP = connectivity/radar specialist. Infineon = power/MCU leader.

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | NXPI (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$55B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$13B |
| [[Automotive]] revenue | ~55% |
| Industrial/IoT revenue | ~25% |
| Gross margin | ~57% |
| P/E | ~18x |
| Dividend yield | ~1.8% |

Higher gross margin than peers (57% vs 40-42%).

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Radar/ADAS leadership
- NFC monopoly in payments
- V2X positioning for autonomous
- Higher margins than peers
- Survived independence test

**Bear case:**
- Auto cycle exposure
- [[China]] risk (blocked deal precedent)
- Mobileye competition in ADAS
- Less EV-specific exposure than power semis
