## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Automotive | \#2 globally (after [[Infineon]]) |
| Automotive radar | \#1 |
| NFC | \#1 globally |
| Secure elements | \#1 |
| V2X (vehicle-to-everything) | Leader |

---

## Product portfolio

**Automotive (55% of revenue):**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| Radar processors | ADAS, autonomous |
| S32 MCUs | Vehicle compute |
| V2X | Vehicle communication |
| In-vehicle networking | CAN, Ethernet |

**Secure transactions:**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| NFC controllers | Contactless payments |
| Secure elements | Apple Pay, Google Pay |
| eSIM | Connected devices |
| Authentication | Access control |

---

## ADAS / autonomous focus

**Radar leadership:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Radar market share | \#1 |
| Customers | Most major OEMs |
| Technology | 77GHz imaging radar |
| Trend | More radar per vehicle |

As ADAS advances → more NXP content per car.

## Qualcomm blocked deal (2018)

**$44B acquisition blocked by China:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Offer | $44B (largest semi deal ever) |
| Blocker | China antitrust (SAMR) |
| Context | US-China trade war beginning |
| Outcome | NXP remained independent |

See [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]].

**Post-block performance:**
- Stock initially dropped 8%
- Proved resilient standalone
- Automotive boom post-2020
- Now worth more than deal price

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Apple | NFC, secure elements |
| Automotive OEMs | Radar, MCUs, V2X |
| Tier 1s | Bosch, Continental |
| Payment networks | Secure transactions |

Apple relationship = recurring secure element revenue.

---

## Manufacturing

**Hybrid model:**

| Approach | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Fabless (advanced) | [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]] |
| Own fabs (mature) | Specialty nodes |
| Locations | Netherlands, US, Asia |

Less node-dependent than AI chips = own fabs viable for some products.

---

## Competitive position

| vs | NXP advantage | NXP disadvantage |
|----|---------------|------------------|
| [[Infineon]] | Radar, V2X, NFC | Power semis scale |
| [[STMicro]] | Connectivity, security | SiC, MEMS |
| [[Renesas]] | Radar, V2X | Japan relationships |
| Mobileye | Broader auto portfolio | Vision-specific |

NXP = connectivity/radar specialist. Infineon = power/MCU leader.

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Radar/ADAS leadership
- NFC monopoly in payments
- V2X positioning for autonomous
- Higher margins than peers (57% gross)
- Survived independence test

**Bear case:**
- Auto cycle normalizing (-5% YoY)
- China risk (blocked deal precedent)
- Mobileye competition in ADAS
- Less EV-specific exposure than power semis
