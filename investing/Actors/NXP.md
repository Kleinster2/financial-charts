**NXP Semiconductors** — Dutch semiconductor company. Focus on automotive, IoT, mobile, and security.

---

## Why it matters

- #2 in automotive semiconductors (after [[Infineon]])
- Radar, V2X, and ADAS chips for autonomous driving
- NFC and secure element leader
- Spun off from Philips, nearly acquired by [[Qualcomm]] (blocked 2018)

---

## Key markets

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Automotive | #2 globally |
| Secure transactions | NFC leader |
| Industrial IoT | Strong |
| Mobile | Secure elements |

---

## Competitive dynamics

- Competes with [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]], Texas Instruments
- Fabless for advanced nodes ([[TSMC]], [[Samsung]])
- Own fabs for mature/specialty nodes

---

## Key events

### Qualcomm acquisition blocked (2018)

[[Qualcomm]]'s $44B bid for NXP was blocked when China withheld antitrust approval. See [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]].

**Impact on NXP:**
- Remained independent (stock initially dropped 8%)
- Proved resilient as standalone company
- Avoided integration risk and culture clash
- Benefited from automotive semiconductor boom post-2020

---

## Investment angle

- Pure-play automotive/IoT semiconductor
- Less exposed to mobile cyclicality than [[Qualcomm]]
- EV transition tailwind (power management, radar, V2X)
- Potential future M&A target (with [[Weaponized antitrust]] risk)
