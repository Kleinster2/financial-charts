## Banco Máxima — the troubled bank

When Sabbá sold to Vorcaro in 2018, Banco Máxima was already:
- Weakened by irregularities and financial losses
- Disqualified by Central Bank (Sabbá restricted from banking operations)
- Under regulatory scrutiny

**The fraud (2014-2016):** Sabbá and former executives accused of:
- Generating fictitious gains
- Simulating valuation of bank investments to reduce reported losses
- Fraudulent accounting maneuvers to conceal insufficient capital

## The 2025 deal

In December 2025, Sabbá signed an ANPP (Acordo de Não Persecução Penal) with the Federal Public Ministry:

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Acknowledgment | Sabbá acknowledged irregularities |
| Payment | ~R$100,000 (70 minimum wages) |
| Outcome | Avoids criminal prosecution for fraudulent management |
| Original sentence | 3 years imprisonment |

## Why it matters

The bank Vorcaro bought was already rotten. Sabbá's conviction shows Banco Máxima had fraudulent accounting practices before Vorcaro took over and scaled them dramatically.

**Pattern:** Troubled bank with regulatory problems → sold to aggressive operator → fraud scaled up → collapse.
