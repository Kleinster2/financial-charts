## The model

Home-swapping eliminates accommodation cost — the largest expense in travel. Members connect through trust-based sub-communities (friends-of-friends, alumni networks, professional groups) and swap homes directly.

**vs. Airbnb:** No nightly fees, no host markup. Cost is essentially the membership/platform fee. Challenge is taking home-swaps from niche to mainstream.

**Investment thesis:** Building infrastructure + interconnected sub-communities to facilitate trusted swaps at scale. The social network layer is key — trust enables the swap.
