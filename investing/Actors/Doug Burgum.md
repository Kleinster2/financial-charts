## Significance

Burgum controls federal land — which means energy permitting, mineral extraction rights, and increasingly, the physical footprint for AI data centers and critical mineral supply chains. His dual role (Interior + Energy Council chair) gives him unusual power over the energy-AI nexus. His tech background (Great Plains Software/Microsoft) makes him fluent in both energy and technology policy.

His presence at the [[Hill and Valley Forum]] reflects the convergence of energy, AI, and defense tech in the Trump administration's agenda.
