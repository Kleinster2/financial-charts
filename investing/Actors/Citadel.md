## Performance convergence (Bloomberg, Jan 2026)

Citadel Wellington's outperformance over the industry narrowed significantly in 2025. From 2020-2024, Wellington consistently delivered 15-38% while the hedge fund industry averaged low single digits — now the gap has closed.

*[[Millennium]]*

| Year | Wellington | Industry avg | Spread |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 2020 | ~26% | ~5% | +21pp |
| 2022 | **+38%** | **-5%** | +43pp |
| 2024 | +15% | ~8% | +7pp |
| 2025 | **+10.2%** | ~8% | **+2pp** |

The convergence raises questions about whether multi-strategy returns will revert to industry norms as the model becomes commoditized. Bloomberg calls it a potential "breaking point" — if pod shops lose their differentiated edge, boutique stock-pickers and macro traders may attract capital again.

See [[Hedge fund capital concentration]] for the structural dynamics.
