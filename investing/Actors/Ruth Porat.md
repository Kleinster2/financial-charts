## Significance

As Alphabet's CIO, Porat oversees the company's massive investment portfolio — including $75B+ annual capex on AI infrastructure, data centers, and the $15B Vizag AI Hub in [[India]]. Her transition from CFO to CIO reflects Google's shift from an advertising company to an AI infrastructure company. Her Morgan Stanley background (she navigated the 2008 financial crisis as CFO) gives her credibility on capital allocation that most tech executives lack.
