## Notable trades

### London Whale (2012)

Weinstein identified mispriced credit derivatives at [[JPMorgan Chase]] before Bruno Iksil's trades became public. When JPMorgan's position unraveled (exposing the bank to $6.2B in losses), Saba and other hedge funds profited by taking opposing positions in the CDS market.

### COVID-19 crash (2020)

Bought cheap CDS on junk-rated companies, sold CDS on investment-grade. Flagship fund returned **33%**, tail fund returned **99%**. Named *Risk* magazine's Hedge Fund of the Year 2021.

### Energy distress (2016)

Profited from capital structure arbitrage in [[Linn Energy]] and [[Chesapeake Energy]] — bought mispriced bonds while shorting equity.

### Trump SPAC (2021)

Invested in [[Digital World Acquisition Corp.]] (DWAC), sold after merger announcement with Trump [[Media]]. Shares surged 357%.
