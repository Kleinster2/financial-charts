## Vulnerability factors

- Heavy entry-level smartphone exposure (hit hardest by DRAM shortage)
- Post-Huawei spinoff still building independent supply chain
- Limited pricing power
- Already in decline before memory crunch hit

## Huawei spinoff context

Huawei sold Honor in Nov 2020 to avoid US sanctions impact on the brand. Honor now operates independently but lacks Huawei's scale and vertical integration advantages.
