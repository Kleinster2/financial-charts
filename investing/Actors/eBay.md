# eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY)

Online marketplace pioneer, now focused on **C2C resale and pre-owned goods**. Pivoting from general marketplace to curated verticals (fashion, collectibles, motors, luxury).

## Depop acquisition (Feb 18, 2026)

Acquiring [[Depop]] from [[Etsy]] for **$1.2B cash**. Expected to close Q2 2026.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | ~$1.2B cash |
| Seller | [[Etsy]] (paid $1.625B in 2021 — taking ~$400M loss) |
| Target | [[Depop]] — Gen Z secondhand fashion marketplace |
| Depop GMS (2025) | ~$1B |
| Depop active buyers | 7M (90% under 34) |
| Depop active sellers | 3M |

**Strategic logic:** Capture younger demographic, deepen fashion/resale vertical. eBay will plug Depop into its shipping, Authenticity Guarantee, financial services, and cross-listing infrastructure.

**Announced alongside:** Q4 earnings beat + above-estimate Q1 guidance. Shares up.

## Strategic direction

eBay under Iannone has been narrowing focus to **high-value verticals** where C2C and pre-owned have structural advantages:
- **Fashion/resale** — Depop acquisition, Authenticity Guarantee for sneakers/luxury
- **Collectibles** — trading cards, memorabilia
- **Motors** — parts & accessories
- **Refurbished** — certified pre-owned electronics

The thesis: eBay can't out-Amazon Amazon on new goods, but owns the C2C resale graph.
