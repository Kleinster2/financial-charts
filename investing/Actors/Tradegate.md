# Tradegate

Berlin-based financial services company operating as the sole market specialist (liquidity provider) on [[Tradegate BSX]] (formerly Tradegate Exchange + Boerse Berlin, merged Jan 1, 2026). Also a market maker on [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], order book manager on the former Boerse Berlin, and market maker on [[EuroTLX]] (Italy). Holds a full BaFin banking license (since 2008). Founded 1986 by [[Holger Timm]] as Berliner Freiverkehr GmbH. Ticker: T2G (Frankfurt). ISIN: DE0005216907.

Business model is spread capture: as the sole specialist on Tradegate BSX, the company earns the bid-ask spread on every trade across 23,000+ international securities. Asset-light (~99.6% gross margin). Revenue highly correlated with retail trading volumes and market volatility — 2021 was the peak (pandemic boom), 2023 the trough, 2024-2025 a strong recovery. Also issues proprietary Mini Futures (3,000+ products since 2021) and operates tradegate.direct, a zero-fee retail trading platform launched in 2025. Private banking via the Berliner Effektenbank branch.

## Competitive landscape

| Venue | Market maker | Key neo-broker | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Tradegate BSX | Tradegate AG (sole specialist) | Broad: JustTrade, DEGIRO, Flatex, Smartbroker+ | Largest retail liquidity pool, widest coverage |
| gettex | [[Baader Bank]] | [[Scalable Capital]] | Main challenger |
| LS Exchange | [[Lang & Schwarz]] | [[Trade Republic]] (exclusive) | Captive order flow via TR |
| Quotrix | Boerse Duesseldorf | Various | Smaller |
| [[Xetra]] | Order book (no specialist) | Institutional | Reference market, not direct retail competitor |

Tradegate's moat is the liquidity flywheel: more volume → tighter spreads → more broker connections → more volume. Lacks an exclusive large neo-broker partner (unlike LS Exchange/Trade Republic or gettex/Scalable), but compensates with broadest distribution and instrument coverage.
