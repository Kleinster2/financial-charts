## Early life and education

Born in Belgium, grew up in France. Father worked for an American company. In 1981, when Mitterrand's socialist government began nationalizing industries, family moved to the US. Philippe was ~14. Attended the French Lycee in New York.

Enrolled at [[MIT]] in 1985. Earned three degrees (all awarded 1991): SB in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering, SB in Economics, SM in CS & EE. Thesis advisor: Professor Stephen A. Ward (later honored with $1M donation to MITx/edX in 2012). Self-described as a "mediocre computer science major" and "middle-of-the-pack tennis player" at MIT.

## Career before Coatue

Rejected by [[Apple]] five separate times after MIT. Spent six months in Chile fishing and learning Spanish. Joined [[McKinsey]] in Madrid (1992-94).

After McKinsey, worked for his future wife Ana Luisa's family business in Spain (1994-95). He and brother Thomas were relegated to a basement office. During idle hours, they picked stocks from the Herald Tribune — [[Microsoft]], [[Intel]], [[Dell Technologies|Dell]] — and made more money investing than at McKinsey. This accidentally sparked his interest in equity markets.

Tried to get hired by [[Tiger Management]]'s IT department — rejected. Worked for free at a small mutual fund for ~6 months to learn financial basics. Met [[Julian Robertson]] through a French friend. Hired as research analyst in 1996.

---

## Tiger Management (1996-1999)

Specialized in European telecom stocks. Conducted rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis for Robertson's fund.

Key lessons from Robertson: hire well-rounded generalists over narrow specialists (the "special sauce" of Tiger). Build a culture of competitive, curious, extroverted analysts. Take concentrated, high-conviction positions over broad diversification.

Overlapped with other first-generation Tiger Cubs: John Griffin ([[Blue Ridge Capital]]), Stephen Mandel ([[Lone Pine]]), Lee Ainslie ([[Maverick Capital]]), Ole Andreas Halvorsen ([[Viking Global]]), Chase Coleman ([[Tiger Global]]).

Left in 1999 to found [[Coatue]] on January 1, 2000 with $45-50M. Launched right at the dot-com peak — survived the bust via long/short approach (long innovative tech, short disrupted incumbents).

## Investment philosophy

Forward-looking earnings as primary edge: the value-add is projecting earnings 5-7 years out, not analyzing current financials. Emphasizes simplicity over complexity. Cites [[Stan Druckenmiller]]: "made 120% of his money in obvious ideas, and he lost 20% everywhere else."

Self-described as "impatient" and someone who changes his mind constantly — traits he believes benefit investing. Runs concentrated portfolios. Top 10 holdings = 47% of Coatue's public book.

Biggest regret: selling [[Tencent]] too early. Invested at 2004 IPO (sub-$1B valuation). Estimates the early exit cost ~$20B in foregone gains.

On position sizing: "You're going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time."

On risk: still wakes up at 3 AM and checks Bloomberg to see "what could go wrong," despite wealth having tripled since 2019 (told Financial Times, 2022).

On past mistakes: "I've made a lot of mistakes, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big" (Bloomberg Invest, June 2024).

## Public statements and views

### AI conviction

Bloomberg Invest Summit (June 25, 2024): Predicted $100T invested in current PC/CPU infrastructure "is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU-based infrastructure." On robots: "What happens when you put that brain inside of a robot and we humans then live side-by-side" — timeline 10-15 years. On quantum: "very small" compared to GPU transition. Disagreed that AI is priced in just because everyone talks about it.

### IPO market

CNBC Delivering Alpha (Nov 13, 2025): "The IPO market is completely broken — beyond repair." Called it "unfair" that retail investors are shut out of high-growth companies pre-IPO. Predicted tokenization would fix the problem "through competition more than through regulatory action."

### Token economy

CNBC Squawk Box (Feb 13, 2026): "The world is moving to the token economy." On [[Anthropic]]: revenue from $9B to $14B run rate in a couple of months — "someone is using these products." Called [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[SpaceX]] potential trillion-dollar companies. Long [[Applied Materials]], semi cap equipment. "We like [[Alphabet]] a lot."

### Fantastic 40

East Meets West 2025 conference: Released the Fantastic 40 Growth & Innovation Index — ranked prediction of 40 largest tech companies by 2030. Projected [[Microsoft]] at $5.7T, [[NVIDIA]] at $5.6T, [[OpenAI]] at $1.6T. Included [[Bitcoin]] with $5T market cap target by 2030. Notable exclusion: [[Alphabet]] (viewed as at risk of disruption). 82% of Coatue's tech portfolio now AI-oriented (up from 31% two years prior).

### Bitcoin

Coinbase State of Crypto Summit (June 2025): "Every day I do think why do I not own it." Added [[Bitcoin]] to Fantastic 40. Framed crypto market cap against $400-500T global net worth.

### Rate policy

CNBC Squawk Box (June 2025): "I don't see exactly the reason to cut rates" — pushed back on [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] rate cut expectations.

## 2022 mea culpa

Released 42-slide investor presentation (May 2022) — widely regarded as one of the most candid Tiger Cub post-mortems:

- YTD through May 2022: -17% gross. Long public book: -45% return on invested capital (vs Nasdaq -23%)
- Explicitly admitted "anchoring bias to the last 10 years" — mental models calibrated to post-GFC low-rate environment
- Acknowledged underestimating "magnitude & speed of drawdown" in unprofitable tech
- Cut gross exposure to 23%, net to 14%
- Named three conviction stocks: [[Tesla]], [[NVIDIA]], [[Datadog]]. The [[NVIDIA]] call proved prescient as AI demand exploded in 2023
- Full-year 2022: -19% (vs [[Tiger Global]] -50%+). Recovered above high-water mark by mid-2024
