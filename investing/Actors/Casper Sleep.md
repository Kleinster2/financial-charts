# Casper Sleep

Pioneered the bed-in-a-box DTC mattress category. IPO'd February 2020 (NYSE: CSPR) at a fraction of its private valuation. DTC-only model proved unsustainable — high customer acquisition costs, negative unit economics. Acquired by [[Durational Capital]] Management in November 2022 for ~$286M ($6.90/share) and taken private.
