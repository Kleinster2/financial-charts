## Business model

### Taobao vs Tmall

| | Taobao | Tmall |
|-|--------|-------|
| Model | C2C (consumer-to-consumer) | B2C (brand-to-consumer) |
| Sellers | Small merchants, individuals | Verified brands, flagship stores |
| Quality | Variable | Higher (brand guarantee) |
| Fees | Lower | Higher (brand premium) |
| MAU | 892M | 877M |

**Combined:** Taobao + Tmall = 65% of Alibaba's revenue (~¥583B / $85B in FY2023)

### Revenue model

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Advertising | Merchants pay for visibility (P4P, display ads) |
| Transaction fees | Commission on sales |
| Value-added services | Logistics, financing, data tools |

---

## Competitive position

| Platform | GMV share | Strength |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Taobao/Tmall** | ~51% | Scale, ecosystem, logistics |
| [[JD.com]] | ~16% | Owned logistics, authenticity |
| [[Pinduoduo]] | ~15% | Group buying, value tier |
| [[Douyin]] e-commerce | Growing | Live commerce, discovery |

**Threat from Douyin:** Live commerce GMV growing 60%+ YoY. Douyin/Kuaishou have surpassed Taobao in live-stream GMV share.

---

## Live commerce

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2022 live-stream GMV | ¥770B (~$110B) |
| Market position | Founded live commerce (2016), now \#3 |
| Challenge | Douyin, Kuaishou taking share |

**2026 China live commerce market:** Projected to exceed $1 trillion.

Taobao pioneered live commerce but is losing ground to short-video platforms.

## Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users under 30 | 60% |
| Male | 62.85% |
| Female | 37.15% |
| Urban focus | Tier 1-3 cities |

Skews young and male — different from JD (families) or Pinduoduo (value-seekers).

## AI integration (2026)

**Agentic commerce with [[Qwen]]:**

Taobao now integrated into [[Alibaba]]'s [[Qwen]] AI chatbot for end-to-end shopping:

|------------|--------|
| Product search via chat | Live (Jan 2026) |
| Price comparison | Live |
| Purchase completion | Live |
| Integration with [[Alipay]] | Live |

See [[Alibaba]] for full [[Qwen]] agentic commerce details.

## Logistics: Cainiao

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Network | China's largest logistics platform |
| Model | Asset-light (coordinates partners) |
| Reach | 224 countries/regions |
| Status | IPO withdrawn (Oct 2023) |

Cainiao gives Taobao/Tmall logistics edge but is not fully owned (Alibaba has 52%).

---

## International: Lazada & AliExpress

| Platform | Region | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| AliExpress | Global (esp. [[Europe]], LatAm) | Cross-border from China |
| Lazada | [[Southeast Asia]] | Local marketplaces |

Alibaba's e-commerce extends beyond China through these platforms.

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Taobao is a business unit of [[Alibaba]].

**Exposure via BABA:**
- Taobao/Tmall = 65% of Alibaba revenue
- Core cash generator
- But growth slowing vs Pinduoduo, Douyin

**Key risks:**
- Live commerce share loss to Douyin/Kuaishou
- Pinduoduo price competition
- Regulatory scrutiny (antitrust)
- [[Consumer]] spending slowdown
