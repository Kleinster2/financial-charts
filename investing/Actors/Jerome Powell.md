### First term (2018-2020)

Trump appointed Powell but turned hostile when Powell raised rates in 2018-2019.

**Trump quotes:**
- Called Powell a "bigger threat than Xi Jinping"
- "Clueless" and "doesn't have a clue"
- Questioned if Powell was "enemy" of America

**Powell response:** Maintained independence, continued data-driven policy.

### Second term escalation (2025-2026)

| Phase | Trump action | Powell response |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Early 2025** | Vaguely friendly pressure for cuts | Continued gradual easing |
| **Spring 2025** | "Major loser," "termination cannot come fast enough" | No public response |
| **Fall 2025** | Dismissed cuts as insufficient | Maintained policy independence |
| **Jan 2026** | DOJ criminal investigation | Called it "pretext" for rate pressure |

**Rate cuts under Trump 2.0:** Fed cut 5x by 25bp since Nov 2024 election (4.50-4.75% → 3.50-3.75%). Trump wanted more, faster.

### DOJ investigation (Jan 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pretext | Building renovation testimony (Jun 2025) |
| Mechanism | Grand jury subpoenas to Federal Reserve |
| Powell's statement | "Threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment... rather than following the preferences of the President" |
| GOP response | Bipartisan backlash |

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** Will oppose all Fed nominees "until this legal matter is fully resolved."

**Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK):** Called investigation "nothing more than an attempt at coercion."

### Expert view: El-Erian (Jan 2026)

**Mohamed El-Erian** on the escalation:

| Point | El-Erian view |
|-------|---------------|
| Nature | "Inevitable step of a feud that's been going on for seven years" |
| Escalation | "Major escalation from both sides" — DOJ and Powell's response |
| Off-ramp | "Hard to find... I don't see it as yet" |
| Market calm | Chair can't easily sway FOMC; bond vigilantes will react if policy becomes political |
| New chair | "Will need time to impose their authority" |

**Why markets aren't alarmed:**
- Rate decisions are committee decisions, not chair alone
- Bond market will demand higher yields if it believes Fed will be "irresponsible"
- [[UK mini-budget crisis 2022|Liz Truss precedent]] — bond vigilantes forced policy reversal in days

**Global risk:**
> "I am worried because the rest of the world is overweight the U.S... The U.S. is perceived not as pristine but as the cleanest dirty shirt. If the U.S. starts eroding its standing in the global economy, then the rest of the world will look to reduce its overweight."

**Gold signal:** Price of gold indicates "at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

| Chair term ends | May 2026 |
| Board seat | Could stay until 2028 if chooses |
| Trump stance | Will not reappoint as Chair |
| Successor | TBD — announcement expected Q1 2026 |

## Legacy assessment

**Bull case:**
- Navigated COVID without depression
- Achieved soft landing (inflation down, no recession)
- Defended Fed independence

**Bear case:**
- "Transitory" call was wrong (delayed hiking)
- Let inflation reach 9%+ before acting
- Balance sheet still bloated
