### First term (2018-2020)

Trump appointed Powell but turned hostile when Powell raised rates in 2018-2019.

**Trump quotes:**
- Called Powell a "bigger threat than Xi Jinping"
- "Clueless" and "doesn't have a clue"
- Questioned if Powell was "enemy" of America

**Powell response:** Maintained independence, continued data-driven policy.

### Second term escalation (2025-2026)

| Phase | Trump action | Powell response |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Early 2025** | Vaguely friendly pressure for cuts | Continued gradual easing |
| **Spring 2025** | "Major loser," "termination cannot come fast enough" | No public response |
| **Fall 2025** | Dismissed cuts as insufficient | Maintained policy independence |
| **Jan 2026** | DOJ criminal investigation | Called it "pretext" for rate pressure |

**Rate cuts under Trump 2.0:** Fed cut 5x by 25bp since Nov 2024 election (4.50-4.75% → 3.50-3.75%). Trump wanted more, faster.

### DOJ investigation (Jan 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pretext | Building renovation testimony (Jun 2025) |
| Mechanism | Grand jury subpoenas to Federal Reserve |
| Powell's statement | "Threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment... rather than following the preferences of the President" |
| GOP response | Bipartisan backlash |

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** Will oppose all Fed nominees "until this legal matter is fully resolved."

**Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK):** Called investigation "nothing more than an attempt at coercion."

**Status (Jan 28):** Fed has not yet complied with subpoenas. Bill Pulte (FHFA Director) was the instigator behind the Powell probe.

### Jan 29 press conference highlights

**On [[Lisa Cook]] case and Supreme Court attendance:**
> "That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history... it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend."

Noted Paul Volcker attended a Supreme Court case in 1985 — precedented behavior.

**On Fed independence:**
> "I am strongly committed to that and so are my colleagues."

**Advice to successor:**
> "Stay out of elected politics. Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it."

> "Our window into democratic accountability is Congress... it's not a passive burden. It's an affirmative regular obligation."

> "You're about to meet the most qualified group of people you've ever worked with... there isn't a better cadre of professionals more dedicated to the public well-being than work at the Fed."

**On what happens if Fed loses independence:**
> "If people lose their faith that we're making decisions only on the basis of our assessment of what's best for everyone... it's going to be hard to retain it."

**On remaining as Governor:** Declined to say whether he would stay on Board after May term ends ("nothing for you on that today").

**On gold/silver hitting record highs (asked if it signals loss of credibility):**
> "Don't take much message macroeconomically. The argument can be made it's, you know, that we're losing credibility or something. It's simply not the case. If you look at where inflation expectations are, our credibility is right where it needs to be."

*Deflects by pointing to anchored [[inflation expectations]] as proof dollar weakness isn't about confidence.*

**On the dollar:** Declined to comment — "We don't talk about the dollar. We don't talk about what moves it around... Treasury Department has that."

### Expert view: El-Erian (Jan 2026)

**[[Mohamed El-Erian]]** on the escalation:

| Point | El-Erian view |
|-------|---------------|
| Nature | "Inevitable step of a feud that's been going on for seven years" |
| Escalation | "Major escalation from both sides" — DOJ and Powell's response |
| Off-ramp | "Hard to find... I don't see it as yet" |
| Market calm | Chair can't easily sway FOMC; bond vigilantes will react if policy becomes political |
| New chair | "Will need time to impose their authority" |

**Why markets aren't alarmed:**
- Rate decisions are committee decisions, not chair alone
- Bond market will demand higher yields if it believes Fed will be "irresponsible"
- [[UK mini-budget crisis 2022|Liz Truss precedent]] — bond vigilantes forced policy reversal in days

**Global risk:**
> "I am worried because the rest of the world is overweight the U.S... The U.S. is perceived not as pristine but as the cleanest dirty shirt. If the U.S. starts eroding its standing in the global economy, then the rest of the world will look to reduce its overweight."

**Gold signal:** Price of gold indicates "at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

**Market uncertainty:** New chair's policy stance unknown. Could be more dovish under political pressure.

**Governor question:** Powell declined to say if he would remain as a Governor after his Chair term ends. Board seat expires 2028.

## Legacy assessment

**Bull case:**
- Navigated COVID without depression
- Achieved soft landing (inflation down, no recession)
- Defended Fed independence

**Bear case:**
- "Transitory" call was wrong (delayed hiking)
- Let inflation reach 9%+ before acting
- Balance sheet still bloated
