## Relevance to semis/AI

- Major [[Automotive semiconductors]] customer
- [[Cruise]] autonomous driving unit (paused robotaxi operations 2023)
- Ultium battery/EV platform requires custom chips
- Vertical integration attempts in software-defined vehicles

## Rare earth exposure

EV transition creates critical rare earth dependency:

| Element | Use | China control |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Neodymium | EV motor magnets | ~90% |
| Dysprosium | High-temp magnet stability | ~99% |

**2025 impact**: China's rare earth controls forced production cuts at US automakers. European rare earth prices hit 6x Chinese domestic.

**GM response**:
- Investing in alternative magnet technologies
- Ultium platform designed for lower rare earth content
- But no near-term substitute for permanent magnets
