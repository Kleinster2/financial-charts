## Jan 27, 2026: Strong guidance lifts stock

**Stock +9%** — hit new 52-week high at $87.14 after Q4 earnings beat and raised 2026 outlook.

### Q4 2025 results

| Metric | Result | Estimate |
|--------|--------|----------|
| EPS (adj) | **$2.51** | $2.27 |
| Net income | -$3.3B | — |
| Special charges | $7.2B | EV capacity realignment |

**Q4 loss driven by EV write-downs** — adjusting capacity and investments for expected decline in EV consumer demand.

### 2026 guidance raised

| Metric | 2026 Guide | 2025 Actual |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Net income | **$10.3-11.7B** | $2.7B |
| EBIT-adjusted | $13-15B | $12.7B |
| EPS | **$11-13** | — |
| CapEx | $10-12B | — |

### Capital return boost

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Dividend | **+20%** to $0.18/quarter |
| Buyback | New **$6B** authorization |

### Tariff impact

US tariffs cost GM **$3.1B in 2025** — less than the $3.5-4.5B expected.

## Why GM matters

GM represents the legacy OEM [[EV transition]] challenge:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Position | \#1 US automaker (by revenue) |
| EV strategy | Ultium platform |
| Autonomy | Cruise (paused) |
| Challenge | Compete with [[Tesla]], [[BYD]] |

---

## Ultium platform

**GM's EV foundation:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Battery | Pouch cells, [[LG Energy Solution]] partnership |
| Chemistry | NCMA (nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum) |
| Range | 300-450 miles depending on config |
| Flexibility | Cars, trucks, SUVs on same platform |

| Vehicle | Segment | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Hummer EV | Truck | Production |
| Cadillac Lyriq | [[Luxury]] SUV | Production |
| Chevy Equinox EV | Mass market | Ramping |
| Chevy Silverado EV | Truck | Production |
| Cadillac Celestiq | Ultra-luxury | Limited |

**Challenge:** Scaling production while maintaining profitability.

## Cruise autonomous unit

**Troubled robotaxi subsidiary:**

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Pedestrian incident | Oct 2023 | Person dragged under vehicle |
| Operations paused | Nov 2023 | All robotaxi service stopped |
| CEO resigned | Nov 2023 | Kyle Vogt out |
| Layoffs | Dec 2023 | 25% workforce cut |
| Restart attempts | 2024-25 | Limited supervised testing |

**Investment:**
- GM invested $10B+ in Cruise
- Peak valuation ~$30B (2021)
- Current value uncertain

**Competitors pulling ahead:** [[Waymo]] ([[Google]]) expanding, Cruise stalled.

---

## Semiconductor relationships

**Key chip suppliers:**

| Supplier | Components |
|----------|------------|
| [[Qualcomm]] | Infotainment (Snapdragon) |
| [[NXP]] | Radar, body control |
| [[Infineon]] | Power semiconductors |
| [[Renesas]] | MCUs |
| [[NVIDIA]] | Drive platform (some models) |

**Chip shortage impact (2021-23):**
- Lost millions of units of production
- Accelerated direct chip relationships
- Considering vertical integration (like [[Tesla]])

---

## Relevance to semis/AI

- Major [[Automotive semiconductors]] customer
- [[Cruise]] autonomous driving unit (paused robotaxi operations 2023)
- Ultium battery/EV platform requires custom chips
- Vertical integration attempts in software-defined vehicles

---

## Rare earth exposure

[[EV transition]] creates critical rare earth dependency:

| Element | Use | [[China]] control |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Neodymium | EV motor magnets | ~90% |
| [[Dysprosium]] | High-temp magnet stability | ~99% |

**2025 impact**: [[China]]'s rare earth controls forced production cuts at US automakers. European rare earth prices hit 6x Chinese domestic.

**GM response**:
- Investing in alternative magnet technologies
- Ultium platform designed for lower rare earth content
- But no near-term substitute for permanent magnets

## Competitive position

| vs | GM advantage | GM disadvantage |
|----|--------------|-----------------|
| [[Tesla]] | Dealer network, brand legacy | EV cost, software |
| [[BYD]] | US market access | Cost, integration |
| [[Ford]] | Scale, trucks | Similar challenges |
| [[Toyota]] | EV commitment | Hybrid lead, quality |

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Ultium platform scaling
- Truck/SUV EV leadership potential
- Legacy ICE cash flow funds transition
- Cheap valuation (6x P/E)
- US content benefits from IRA

**Bear case:**
- Cruise impairment risk
- EV profitability uncertain
- Rare earth exposure
- [[China]] JV risk (geopolitics)
- Competition from [[Tesla]], [[BYD]], new entrants
