## Why FluidStack matters

Critical deployment layer for AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Backer | Google |
| Role | GPU cloud + deployment services |
| Key deals | Hut 8 ($7B), TeraWulf (200MW), Anthropic (~1M TPUv7) |

---

## Business model

**Two functions:**

1. **GPU Cloud:** Distributed GPU rental
2. **Deployment Services:** On-site operations for AI infrastructure

## Anthropic deal (Jan 2026)

**Per SemiAnalysis:** FluidStack handles physical operations for Anthropic's ~1M TPUv7 deployment:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cabling | Physical infrastructure setup |
| Burn-in | Testing before deployment |
| Acceptance testing | Quality assurance |
| Remote-hands | Ongoing physical operations |

**Structure:**
- [[Anthropic]] buys TPUs from [[Broadcom]]
- [[TeraWulf]], [[Hut 8]], [[Cipher Mining]] provide DC infrastructure
- **FluidStack** handles deployment and operations
- Effectively outsources physical server operations for Anthropic

## Crypto miner partnerships

FluidStack as intermediary between hyperscalers/AI labs and crypto miners:

| Miner | Deal | Backer |
|-------|------|--------|
| [[Hut 8]] | $7B (15yr, 245MW) | Google |
| [[TeraWulf]] | 200MW (10yr) | Google |
| [[Cipher Mining]] | Partnerships | — |

Google invests through FluidStack → FluidStack contracts with miners → Miners provide infrastructure.

## Investment implications

**Not investable directly** (private), but validates:
- [[Crypto-to-AI pivot]] — FluidStack as key enabler
- [[Hut 8]], [[TeraWulf]] — FluidStack partnerships de-risk
- AI infrastructure buildout beyond hyperscaler clouds
