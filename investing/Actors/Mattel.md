## Q4 & FY 2025 results (reported Feb 10, 2026)

Stock crashed ~27% on earnings miss and weak guidance.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY | FY 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Net sales | $1,766M | +7% | $5,348M | -1% |
| Gross margin | 45.9% | -480bps | 48.7% | -210bps |

| Operating cash flow | — | — | $593M | -$207M |
| Share buybacks | $188M (Q4) | — | $600M (FY) | — |

Margin pressure from higher discounts, inflation, FX, tariff cost timing. December US gross billings grew less than expected.

North America -5%, International +4-6%.

## 2026 guidance

| Metric | 2026 Guide |
|--------|------------|
| Net sales | $5.4-5.6B (+3-6% cc) |
| Adj gross margin | ~50% |
| Adj operating income | $550-600M |
| Adj EPS | $1.18-$1.30 |

Includes ~$150M from [[Mattel163]] mobile games acquisition and ~$150M in strategic investments (digital games, first-party data, D2C, AI, infrastructure). Market disappointed — guidance below consensus.

## Strategic moves

TMNT license (Feb 2026): [[Paramount Global|Paramount]] and Mattel signed global multi-year deal for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] products starting 2027. Includes tie-ins for animated sequel and live-action/CG hybrid in 2028.

Mattel163 acquisition: Full acquisition of mobile games JV (previously partial ownership). Expected ~$150M revenue contribution in 2026 (partial year).

New $1.5B buyback authorization through 2028 (on top of $600M executed in 2025).

Cost savings: $50M expected in 2026, total program raised to $225M.

## Mattel Studios (film & TV)

In June 2025, Mattel merged its Films and Television divisions into **Mattel Studios**, led by Robbie Brenner (produced the Barbie movie). This is the core of the IP monetization strategy post-Barbie.

| Project | Studio partner | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Barbie (2023) | [[Warner Bros. Discovery\|WBD]] | Released | $1.4B box office, proved the model |
| Masters of the Universe | [[Amazon\|MGM]] | **June 5, 2026** | Directed by Travis Knight (Laika). First trailer Jan 2026 |
| Matchbox | TBD | Expected 2026 | Live-action |
| Hot Wheels | TBD | In development | Live-action |
| Barney | TBD | In development | Live-action |
| Thomas & Friends | TBD | In development | Live-action |
| American Girl | TBD | In development | — |
| Polly Pocket | [[Lionsgate]] | In development | Lily Collins attached |
| Magic 8 Ball | TBD | In development | — |
| Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots | [[Universal]] | In development | — |
| Barbie 25th anniversary | — | 2026 | Animated special |
| Tony the Tattooed Man | TBD | Early development | Tracie Laymon directing |

Mattel has 14+ projects in various stages. The pipeline is the bull case — if Masters of the Universe lands, it validates the repeatable IP-to-film model beyond Barbie.

## Hasbro contrast (Feb 2026)

Reuters called it "a tale of two toymakers." Both gave weak 2026 guidance, but:
- [[Hasbro]] shares +9% — Wizards of the Coast/digital gaming segment revenue +86%, Magic: The Gathering +141%, 45% operating margin
- Mattel shares -27% — worst single-day drop in 20+ years

The gap: Hasbro already has a scaled digital gaming business. Mattel is investing $110M in 2026 to build one (via [[Mattel163]] acquisition + new initiatives), but it's margin-dilutive in the near term. D.A. Davidson: "Mattel is in the early stages of an investment similar to Hasbro's investment in gaming over seven years ago."

## IP & entertainment strategy

Mattel has pivoted from toy manufacturer to IP company:
- Barbie movie (2023): $1.4B box office, proved entertainment value of toy IP
- Film pipeline: 14+ projects via Mattel Studios (see above)
- Digital: [[Mattel163]] mobile games (full acquisition from [[NetEase]]), $110M digital investment in 2026
- D2C: Mattel Creations (limited drops, collectors)
- First-party data platform + AI investments

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- IP portfolio (Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO) has enduring brand value
- Entertainment/content pipeline
- Buyback support ($1.5B new authorization)
- Cost savings program
- TMNT license adds growth category

Bear:
- Barbie post-movie decline accelerating
- Fisher-Price structural weakness (birth rate decline)
- Margin compression — discounting, FX, tariffs
- Weak 2026 guidance vs consensus
- Distant #2 to Hasbro in key categories
