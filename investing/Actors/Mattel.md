## Strategic moves

TMNT license (Feb 2026): [[Paramount Global|Paramount]] and Mattel signed global multi-year deal for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] products starting 2027. Includes tie-ins for animated sequel and live-action/CG hybrid in 2028.

Mattel163 acquisition: Full acquisition of mobile games JV (previously partial ownership). Expected ~$150M revenue contribution in 2026 (partial year).

New $1.5B buyback authorization through 2028 (on top of $600M executed in 2025).

Cost savings: $50M expected in 2026, total program raised to $225M.

## IP & entertainment strategy

Mattel has pivoted from toy manufacturer to IP company:
- Barbie movie (2023): $1.4B box office, proved entertainment value of toy IP
- Film pipeline: [[Hot Wheels]], Polly Pocket, American Girl, Masters of the Universe
- Digital: Mattel163 mobile games, first-party data platform
- D2C: Mattel Creations (limited drops, collectors)
