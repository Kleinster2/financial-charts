## Why Phillips 66 matters for Venezuela

Gulf Coast refineries configured for heavy crude:

- Alliance refinery (Louisiana) — heavy crude capable
- Sweeny refinery (Texas) — complex, flexible

## Financials

![[psx-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue stable at ~$130-135B annual; Q4 2025 net income spiked to $2.9B on $2B special item from European retail disposition. Adjusted earnings $1.0B — still a strong quarter driven by refining margin recovery.*

### Q4 2025 earnings (reported Feb 4, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $34.1B | $33.7B |
| Net income (reported) | $2,906M | $8M |
| Net income (adjusted) | $1,002M | $(63)M |
| EPS (diluted) | $7.17 | $0.01 |
| Adjusted EPS | $2.47 | $(0.15) |
| Operating cash flow | $2,752M | $1,198M |

### Segment pre-tax income (adjusted, Q4 2025)

| Segment | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Midstream | $717M | $708M |
| Chemicals ([[CPChem]] JV) | $19M | $72M |
| Refining | $542M | $(759)M |
| Marketing & Specialties | $439M | $185M |
| Renewable Fuels | $(19)M | $28M |
| Corporate & Other | $(363)M | $(294)M |

Refining swung from $(759)M loss to $542M profit — realized margins jumped from $6.08/bbl to $12.48/bbl. WRB acquisition (full ownership of [[Chevron]] JV refineries) added capacity. Record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes exceeded 1M bpd each in Midstream.

### Full year 2025

| Metric | FY 2025 | FY 2024 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $132.4B | $143.1B |
| Net income (reported) | $4,403M | $2,117M |
| Adjusted earnings | $2,632M | $3,043M |
| Adjusted EPS | $6.44 | $7.16 |
| Operating cash flow | $5,000M | $4,200M |

### Balance sheet (Dec 31, 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cash | $1.1B |
| Total debt | $19.7B |
| Net debt-to-capital | 38% |
| 2026 capex budget | $2.4B ($1.1B sustaining + $1.3B growth) |

### Guidance

- Net debt-to-capital target <30% by 2027, total debt target $17B
- Q1 2026: refining crude utilization low-90%s, turnaround costs $170-190M
- Coastal Bend pipeline expansion late 2026, Iron Mesa gas plant 2027
- >50% of operating cash flow returned to shareholders

## Price vs peers

![[psx-vs-vlo-vs-mpc-price-chart.png]]
*PSX +70% since Jan 2023 vs MPC +100% and VLO +80%. MPC's pure-refining leverage and aggressive buybacks have widened the gap. PSX's diversified model provides more downside protection but caps upside in refining upcycles.*

## vs peers

| Aspect | Phillips 66 | [[Valero]] | [[PBF Energy]] |
|--------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Size | Large | Largest | Smaller |
| Focus | Diversified | Pure refining | Pure refining |
| Midstream | Yes | No | No |
| Venezuela leverage | Moderate | High | High |
