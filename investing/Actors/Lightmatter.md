## Why Lightmatter matters

Novel chip architecture using photonics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | **$4.4B** (Oct 2025) |
| Raised | **$850M** |
| HQ | Mountain View, CA |
| Technology | Photonic interconnects |

## Technology

**Light-based computing:**
- Photonic interconnects (not electrons)
- Faster data transfers between chips
- Lower power consumption
- Addresses GPU cluster bottlenecks

**The problem it solves:** AI clusters limited by chip-to-chip bandwidth. Light moves faster than electrons.

## Product: Passage

**Photonic interconnect:**
- Connects GPUs/accelerators
- Higher bandwidth than electrical
- Lower latency
- Energy efficient

## Competitive landscape

| Approach | Companies |
|----------|-----------|
| Electronic interconnects | NVIDIA NVLink, AMD Infinity Fabric |
| **Photonic interconnects** | Lightmatter, Ayar Labs |
| Co-packaged optics | Intel, Broadcom |

Lightmatter betting on photonics winning long-term.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Photonics = physics advantage
- AI scaling needs better interconnects
- Power efficiency matters
- Early mover in photonics

**Bear:**
- Unproven at scale
- NVIDIA can iterate NVLink
- Manufacturing complexity
- Ecosystem adoption risk
