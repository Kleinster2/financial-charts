## Missile business spinoff (Jan 2026)

Spinning out Aerojet Rocketdyne missile business as **separately traded public company**, targeting completion by end of 2026.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DoD investment | **$1B** in spinoff entity |
| IPO proceeds | Fund capacity expansion |
| Analyst view | Jefferies (Kahyaoglu): **30% combined upside** (L3 + spinoff) |
| Rationale | Missile businesses trade at higher multiples than diversified primes |

**Strategic logic:** Unlocks value — pure-play missile company gets defense-growth multiple while L3 retains electronics/ISR focus.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- ISR demand increasing
- Space systems growth
- Tactical radio market leadership
- Missile spinoff value unlock (30% combined upside per Jefferies)
- Stallard (Vertical Research): top US pick alongside [[General Dynamics]]
