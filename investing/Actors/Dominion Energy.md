## What makes Dominion, Dominion

**Geographic monopoly on the internet's backbone.** Loudoun County hosts 300+ data centers carrying ~70% of US internet traffic. AWS US-East-1, Microsoft, Google, Meta all here. If Dominion has power issues, the internet has issues.

**The math:** Connected 15 data centers in 2024 totaling 1,000 MW. Plans 15 more in 2025. Since Dec 2024 IRP, data center demand forecast increased 17% — now 47.2 GW contracted. PJM auction prices up 833% for 2025-2026 delivery year due to AI demand. Virginia energy demand projected to rise 183% by 2040.

## New data center rate class (Nov 2025)

Virginia SCC approved new electricity rate class for large-scale AI data centers, effective January 2027:

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| Distribution/transmission demand | Pay for 85% of contracted |
| Generation demand | Pay for 60% of contracted |

Designed to protect residential ratepayers from rising costs as DC expansion accelerates.

## Capital investment required

| Category | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Transmission alone | $28.3B capex |
| Total (depending on generation type) | $91.8B-$270B |

## Virginia regulatory (2025 biennial review)

SCC rejected Dominion's full rate request:

| Item | Requested | Approved |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 2026 revenue increase | $822M | $565.7M |
| 2027 revenue increase | $345M | $209.9M |
| ROE | 10.4% | 9.8% (up from 9.7%) |

Virginia segment adjusted operating earnings: $679M (+2.5% YoY, Q3 2025).

## Power constraints

Ashburn/NoVA is power constrained:
- New projects delayed 3-5 years for grid connection
- Transmission upgrades slow (regulatory + construction)
- Pushing new DCs to other regions
- Grid upgrades require $28.3B+ in transmission alone

Dominion's limits = Ashburn's limits = the internet's limits.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Geographic monopoly on Data Center Alley
- 47.2 GW contracted pipeline (decades of growth)
- Regulated returns on massive capex
- ~5% dividend yield
- Essential infrastructure — no substitute
- Rate class protects other ratepayers

**Bear:**
- Execution risk on grid upgrades ($28-270B)
- Regulatory lag (SCC rejected $257M of revenue request)
- Capital intensity (constant equity/debt raises)
- Interest rate sensitivity
- DCs may shift to other regions if delays persist
