## Why it matters

Worldcoin sits at the intersection of crypto, AI, and identity:

| Angle | Relevance |
|-------|-----------|
| Proof of humanity | Bot-resistant verification as AI-generated content explodes |
| Altman connection | Same founder as [[OpenAI]] — potential integration |
| Custom hardware | Orb devices = chip demand, edge inference |
| Token economics | WLD token with massive unlock schedule |

## Company: Tools for Humanity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2019 |
| HQ | San Francisco (548 Market St) |
| CEO | Alex Blania |
| Total raised | $315M+ |
| Latest round | Series C ($115M, May 2023) |

**Founders:** [[Sam Altman]], Alex Blania, Max Novendstern

## Token economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Token | WLD |
| Price | ~$0.56 (Jan 2026) |
| Market cap | ~$1.5B |
| FDV | ~$5.6B |
| Total supply | 10B WLD |
| Community allocation | 60% |

**[[Token unlocks]]:** 37M WLD (~$18M) unlocking weekly until July 2026. Locked tokens vest to team, investors, and community over time — recipients often sell immediately, creating persistent downward pressure regardless of fundamentals. The FDV/market cap gap (3.7x) shows ~73% of supply still locked.

## Adoption

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Verified users | 25M (Feb 2025) |
| World App | Wallet + payments |
| World Chain | L2 for human-verified transactions |

**Recent features:**
- Instant WLD transfers (Dec 2025)
- Encrypted chat (Dec 2025)
- USDC integration on World Chain (June 2025)

## OpenAI social network (Jan 2026)

Forbes reported OpenAI exploring social network using Orb verification:
- Goal: Bot-resistant "proof of personhood"
- WLD spiked 40%+ on news (Jan 28, 2026)
- Integration with Reddit for bot-resistant IDs hinted

**If true:** Major utility unlock for World protocol.

## Hardware: The Orb

Iris-scanning device for identity verification:
- Custom silicon
- Edge AI inference
- Deployed globally at verification locations
- Privacy-preserving (claims to delete raw images)

**Chip implications:** Each Orb needs compute for on-device iris processing.

---

## Regulatory issues

| Country | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Spain | Investigation/restrictions |
| Germany | Privacy concerns |
| Thailand | Raids (Nov 2025) |

Core issue: Biometric data collection in developing countries raises ethics concerns.

---

## Risks

- **[[Token unlocks]]** — Weekly selling pressure through July 2026
- **Regulatory** — Privacy laws restricting Orb deployments
- **Utility** — Still searching for killer app beyond airdrops
- **Competition** — Other identity solutions (ENS, Gitcoin Passport)
- **Altman distraction** — His primary focus is [[OpenAI]]
