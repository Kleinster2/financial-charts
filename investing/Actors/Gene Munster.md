## Career arc

Munster built his reputation as one of Wall Street's most persistent Apple bulls during his two decades at Piper Jaffray — famously predicting an Apple television set for years (it never materialized). Left in 2017 to co-found Loup Ventures, a venture-focused firm, which evolved into [[Deepwater Asset Management]] by 2019 as the team shifted toward managing public market portfolios alongside venture.

The transition from sell-side analyst to buy-side portfolio manager is notable: Munster's conviction calls on [[NVIDIA]] and AI infrastructure now have real capital behind them, not just price targets.

## NVIDIA thesis

Munster is among the most vocal institutional bulls on [[NVIDIA]]. Key positions (as of Feb 2026):

| Claim | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| CY2027 growth | Street at 28% is "too conservative" — expects 50%+ |
| AI inning | "Still in the second inning" of infrastructure buildout |
| Stock view | Goes higher but "relatively less upside" vs smaller AI names due to size |
| Position | Deepwater owns NVDA |

Pre-earnings (Feb 21), Munster posted on X that the Street's 28% CY2027 growth estimate was too conservative, predicting it would reach at least 40%. Post-earnings, he revised upward to 50%+.

On the Q4 FY26 call, Munster highlighted the supply/demand equilibrium paradox — [[Colette Kress]] saying NVIDIA has enough inventory for CY2026 is *psychologically negative* because it removes the "dream bigger" narrative that supply constraints provide.

## OpenClaw mention (Feb 25, 2026)

In his Pressure Points podcast immediately after NVIDIA earnings, Munster cited using AI agents at Deepwater — specifically mentioning [[OpenClaw]] and "Claude co-work" — as evidence that AI utility has achieved "a meaningful step forward" in recent months. Notable as a mainstream asset manager using specific AI developer tools to validate an investment thesis.
