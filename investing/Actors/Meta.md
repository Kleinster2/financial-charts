#actor #hyperscaler #usa

**Meta (Facebook)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, massive NVIDIA buyer, open-source AI leader (Llama).

---

## Relevance to semis

Meta is one of the largest NVIDIA GPU buyers. Their AI capex flows directly to [[TSMC]] via NVIDIA.

---

## Chip strategy

- Heavy [[NVIDIA]] dependency (350K H100s)
- MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) — custom inference chip, now developing training chip
- Testing first in-house training chip (RISC-V based, Mar 2025)
- Open-source AI (Llama) drives broader GPU demand ecosystem

---

## AI leadership

**Alexandr Wang** (Scale AI founder) hired summer 2025 to lead Meta AI efforts. Now recruiting aggressively including Manus team.

**Vision:** Zuckerberg racing to build "personal superintelligence"

## 2025 AI acquisitions

| Acquisition | Price | What |
|-------------|-------|------|
| **Manus** | ~$2B+ | AI agents (Chinese-founded) |
| **Rivos** | ~$2B | Custom chip design (RISC-V) |
| PlayAI | — | AI audio |
| WaveForms | — | AI audio |
| Limitless | — | Wearables |

**Manus (Jan 2026):**
- Chinese-founded AI agent startup (~100 staff)
- Meta's 3rd largest acquisition ever (after Instagram, WhatsApp)
- "Leading autonomous general-purpose agent"
- Was "hailed as the next DeepSeek"
- Parent company Butterfly Effect backed by Benchmark (drew China hawk criticism)
- Deal closed in ~10 days
- Signals aggressive catch-up in [[Agentic AI]]

**Geopolitical angle:**
- Rare US acquisition of cutting-edge Chinese AI
- Brain drain concerns: "An incredible company and team are being sold to the United States"
- Could raise hackles in Washington AND Beijing

---

## Smart glasses & wearables

**Ray-Ban Meta (with EssilorLuxottica):**
- Best-selling smart glasses ever
- Camera + audio + Meta AI assistant
- Consumer-friendly form factor (looks like normal Ray-Bans)
- Entry point to AR ecosystem

**Orion (AR glasses prototype):**
- Full holographic display
- Years from consumer release
- "The future" of Meta hardware

**Wearables strategy:**
- Acquired Limitless (wearables startup)
- Start with audio/camera → graduate to full AR
- Competing with 70+ Chinese entrants

See [[Wearable AI]] for competitive landscape.

---

## Monetization

- Exploring premium subscriptions for Meta AI assistant
- Pressure to justify $65B AI capex
- Manus gives them actual agent product to monetize
- Ray-Ban Meta glasses as hardware revenue + AI distribution

---

## GPU deployment bottleneck

Meta is the clearest example of "shipped ≠ deployed" — see [[GPU deployment bottleneck]].

**CIP surge (Q3'24 → Q3'25: +$20.7B YoY):**

| Quarter | CIP Balance | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Q3 2022 | $23.6B | Included office facilities |
| Q3 2023 | $22.9B | First time DC/servers only |
| Q3 2024 | $23.3B | Baseline |
| Q4 2024 | $26.8B | Surge begins |
| Q1 2025 | $32.4B | +$5.6B QoQ |
| Q2 2025 | $36.0B | +$3.6B QoQ |
| Q3 2025 | **$44.0B** | +$8B QoQ, excludes Hyperion |

**10-K disclosure:** "servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required" — $1.4B in Dec 2023, $2.2B in Dec 2022.

## Socrates South power generation (Jan 2026)

**Meta building 200MW+ on-site gas power generation:**

| Equipment | Units | MW each | Total |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| [[Solar Turbines]] Titan 250 IGT | 3 | 23 MW | 69 MW |
| [[Solar Turbines]] Titan 130 IGT | 9 | 16.5 MW | 148.5 MW |
| [[Siemens Energy]] SGT-400 IGT | 3 | 14.3 MW | 42.9 MW |
| Caterpillar 3520 fast-start | 15 | 3.1 MW | 46.5 MW |
| **Gross total** | | | **~307 MW** |

**Design:** N+1+1 redundancy → operational capacity 200MW+

**Key insight:** Hybrid fleet (4 turbine types) diversifies supplier risk. Solar Turbines is a Caterpillar subsidiary — essentially 2 vendors (Caterpillar + Siemens).

**Pattern:** Another [[BYOP]] example — Meta joining OpenAI in on-site generation. See [[Power constraints]].

## Data center portfolio (Q3 2025)

**On-balance-sheet (~$12.3-13.5B in CIP):**

| Project | Location | Est. CIP | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| Prometheus | Ohio | $0.8-1.0B | Active, 1GW, H100/B200, 2026 |
| Cheyenne | Wyoming | ~$0.8B | Peak Build, 800k sq ft |
| Jeffersonville | Indiana | ~$0.8B | Liquid-cooled redesign |
| Kuna | Idaho | ~$0.9B | Active, ~960k sq ft |
| El Paso | Texas | $1.5B | Early, "Superintelligence" site |
| Montgomery | Alabama | $1.5B | Peak Build (up from $800M) |
| Expansions | Various | ~$6.0B | Temple TX, Rosemount MN |

**Off-balance-sheet:**

| Project | Location | Meta Share | Structure |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Hyperion** | Louisiana | $5.4B | $27B JV with [[Blue Owl]], Meta 20% equity |

Hyperion: 5GW eventual capacity, first phase 2028. **Not included in $44B CIP.**

**CFO warning:** Depreciation spike coming in 2026-2027 when CIP assets activate. Currently in "buy now, deploy later" mode.

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: NVIDIA GPUs = TSMC
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Tier 1 spender, validates AI capex cycle
**[[Agentic AI]]**: Manus acquisition = competitive pressure on [[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]]
**[[Long Anthropic]]**: Meta now a direct competitor in agents
