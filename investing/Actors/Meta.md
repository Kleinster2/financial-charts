**Meta (Facebook)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, massive NVIDIA buyer, open-source AI leader (Llama).

---

## Relevance to semis

Meta is one of the largest NVIDIA GPU buyers. Their AI capex flows directly to [[TSMC]] via NVIDIA.

---

## Chip strategy

- Heavy [[NVIDIA]] dependency (350K H100s)
- MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) — custom inference chip, now developing training chip
- Testing first in-house training chip (RISC-V based, Mar 2025)
- Open-source AI (Llama) drives broader GPU demand ecosystem
