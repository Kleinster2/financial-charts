## Nuclear energy (Jan 2026)

**Meta becoming one of the largest corporate nuclear buyers in US history:**

| Partner | Deal |
|---------|------|
| **[[Constellation Energy]]** | $10B Louisiana data center |
| **[[Vistra]]** | 2.6 GW from 3 OH/PA nuclear plants (20-year PPA) |
| **[[TerraPower]]** | Advanced reactor partnership |
| **[[Oklo]]** | Small modular reactor deal |

**Vistra deal details (Jan 2026):**
- 20-year PPA at premium price
- 2.6 GW total from three nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania
- Only ~1/6 is expansion, ~5/6 is existing capacity
- Criticized for grabbing existing grid capacity rather than building new
- Vistra claims deal underwrites license extension applications
- Stock fell on PJM's BYOG proposal — signals era of existing-capacity grabs may be ending

**Capacity:** Up to **6.6 GW** of new and existing clean energy by 2035.

**Jobs:** Thousands of construction jobs, hundreds of long-term operational positions.

**Context:** Hyperscalers racing to secure nuclear for AI data center power. See also [[Microsoft]] Constellation deal, [[Amazon]] nuclear investments, [[Oracle]] energy strategy.

## GPU deployment bottleneck

Meta is the clearest example of "shipped ≠ deployed" — see [[GPU deployment bottleneck]].

**CIP surge (Q3'24 → Q3'25: +$20.7B YoY):**

| Quarter | CIP Balance | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Q3 2022 | $23.6B | Included office facilities |
| Q3 2023 | $22.9B | First time DC/servers only |
| Q3 2024 | $23.3B | Baseline |
| Q4 2024 | $26.8B | Surge begins |
| Q1 2025 | $32.4B | +$5.6B QoQ |
| Q2 2025 | $36.0B | +$3.6B QoQ |
| Q3 2025 | **$44.0B** | +$8B QoQ, excludes Hyperion |

**10-K disclosure:** "servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required" — $1.4B in Dec 2023, $2.2B in Dec 2022.

## Socrates South power generation (Jan 2026)

**Meta building 200MW+ on-site gas power generation:**

| Equipment | Units | MW each | Total |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| [[Solar Turbines]] [[Titan]] 250 IGT | 3 | 23 MW | 69 MW |
| [[Solar Turbines]] [[Titan]] 130 IGT | 9 | 16.5 MW | 148.5 MW |
| [[Siemens Energy]] SGT-400 IGT | 3 | 14.3 MW | 42.9 MW |
| [[Caterpillar]] 3520 fast-start | 15 | 3.1 MW | 46.5 MW |
| **Gross total** | | | **~307 MW** |

**Design:** N+1+1 redundancy → operational capacity 200MW+

**Key insight:** Hybrid fleet (4 turbine types) diversifies supplier risk. Solar Turbines is a [[Caterpillar]] subsidiary — essentially 2 vendors ([[Caterpillar]] + [[Siemens]]).

**Pattern:** Another [[BYOP]] example — Meta joining OpenAI in on-site generation. See [[Power constraints]].

## $60B financing (Oct 2025)

**Largest AI capital raise in history:**

| Tranche | Size | Structure | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| **SPV (off-balance-sheet)** | $30B | [[Morgan Stanley]] → Blue Owl | Largest private capital deal ever |
| **Corporate bonds** | $30B | Investment-grade | Largest IG offering of 2025 |

**Why off-balance-sheet matters:**
- Preserves debt capacity for M&A
- Avoids earnings volatility from construction
- Maintains credit ratings
- Meta only responsible for lease payments, not construction risk

**Context:** [[Morgan Stanley]] estimates $1.5T total external AI financing needed, $800B via private credit by 2028.

See [[AI infrastructure financing]].

**CFO warning:** Depreciation spike coming in 2026-2027 when CIP assets activate. Currently in "buy now, deploy later" mode.
