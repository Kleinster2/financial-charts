**Meta (Facebook)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, massive NVIDIA buyer, open-source AI leader (Llama).

Largest social media company with 3.5B daily active users, $200.9B FY2025 revenue (+22% YoY), and $78.5B net income. Q4 2025 beat estimates ($59.9B revenue, $8.88 EPS vs $8.16 expected) and guided Q1 2026 revenue $53.5-56.5B above consensus. AI capex guidance of $115-135B for 2026 (up 60-87% from $72.2B) makes Meta one of the largest NVIDIA GPU buyers — 350K H100s deployed, multiyear NVIDIA deal signed Feb 2026. Open-source Llama strategy may shift proprietary as Google Gemini 3 advances. The bull case: ad monetization compounding on engagement growth (+18% impressions), AI efficiency gains, and MTIA custom chips reducing GPU dependency. The bear case: Reality Labs burning $6B/quarter, $115-135B capex commitment with uncertain AI ROI, and FTC antitrust appeal on Instagram/WhatsApp acquisitions.

## Chip strategy

- Heavy [[NVIDIA]] dependency (350K H100s)
- MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) — custom inference chip, now developing training chip
- Testing first in-house training chip ([[RISC-V]] based, Mar 2025)
- Open-source AI (Llama) drives broader GPU demand ecosystem

### NVIDIA multiyear deal (Feb 17, 2026)

Signed multiyear pact to deploy "millions" of [[NVIDIA]] processors:

- **Scope:** Blackwell (current), Vera Rubin (next-gen AI accelerators), Grace/Vera CPUs, plus networking equipment
- **CPU first:** Meta becomes first large DC operator to use NVIDIA Grace CPUs in **standalone servers** (not paired with GPU accelerators) — encroaching on [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] territory
- **Grace CPU use cases:** backend data center workloads (databases, data manipulation, ML). NVIDIA claims 2x performance/watt vs incumbents
- **No dollar figure or timeline disclosed**
- Zuckerberg: expanding partnership to "deliver personal superintelligence to everyone in the world"
- Meta also developing in-house chips (MTIA) and in talks with [[Google]] about using TPUs — deal signals NVIDIA retaining dominant share despite alternatives
- Meta accounts for ~9% of NVIDIA revenue (~$13B annualized at current run rate)

### AMD 6GW deal (Feb 24, 2026)

One week after the NVIDIA deal, signed multiyear partnership with [[AMD]] for up to **6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs**:

- **First shipments:** H2 2026 — custom MI450 in [[Helios]] rack-scale servers + AI-optimized [[EPYC]] CPUs
- **Warrants:** 160M AMD shares (~10% of company), vesting on deployment milestones (1GW → 6GW) + stock price thresholds
- **Same structure** as AMD's [[OpenAI]] deal (Oct 2025) — also 160M shares
- **Signal:** Meta diversifying GPU supply across both major vendors while maintaining $135B capex plan
- AMD +7%, Meta flat on the news

See [[Meta-AMD 6GW deal]] for full details.

---

## Nuclear energy (Feb 2026 update)

**Meta becoming one of the largest corporate nuclear buyers in US history:**

| Partner | Deal | Capacity |
|---------|------|----------|
| **[[Constellation Energy]]** | $10B Louisiana data center | — |
| **[[Vistra]]** | 20-year PPA, 3 OH/PA plants | 2.6 GW |
| **[[TerraPower]]** | Advanced reactor partnership | TBD |
| **[[Oklo]]** | SMRs (by 2032) | 690 MW |

**Feb 2026 announcement:** Joel Kaplan stated these deals make "Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history." Combined capacity up to **6.6 GW** over 20 years.

**Vistra deal details (Jan 2026):**
- 20-year PPA at premium price
- 2.6 GW total from three nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania
- Only ~1/6 is expansion, ~5/6 is existing capacity
- Criticized for grabbing existing grid capacity rather than building new
- Vistra claims deal underwrites license extension applications
- Stock fell on PJM's BYOG proposal — signals era of existing-capacity grabs may be ending

**New nuclear capacity:** 2 SMRs under construction expected online by 2032 (690 MW combined).

**Context:** Hyperscalers racing to secure nuclear for AI data center power. See also [[Microsoft]] Constellation deal, [[Amazon]] nuclear investments, [[Oracle]] energy strategy.

## Anduril defense partnership (Jan 2026)

**AI-powered military helmet:**
- Partnership with [[Anduril]] for US military products
- VR/AR features for soldiers
- Combines Meta Reality Labs hardware + Anduril defense AI

**CTO Andrew Bosworth:**
> "Tides have turned" in Silicon Valley — more acceptable to support US military.

> "There's a much stronger patriotic underpinning than I think people give Silicon Valley credit for... a return to grace."

**Silicon Valley history:** Founded on military development (DARPA, etc.). Meta sees this as returning to roots.

**Reality Labs:** Bosworth expects 2026 to be "particularly consequential" — market will determine if people adopt the technology

---

## Monetization

- Exploring premium subscriptions for Meta AI assistant
- Pressure to justify $65B AI capex
- Manus gives them actual agent product to monetize
- Ray-Ban Meta glasses as hardware revenue + AI distribution

---

## Stablecoin payments (Feb 2026)

**Meta testing stablecoin-based payments for H2 2026 launch:**

- Issued RFPs to external infrastructure firms for stablecoin integration across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp
- **[[Stripe]]** is leading candidate — CEO Patrick Collison joined Meta board April 2025
- [[Stripe]] acquired Bridge (stablecoin infrastructure) for ~$1.1B in Oct 2024; Bridge received conditional OCC national trust bank charter Feb 2026
- **Not issuing own token** — Meta as distribution channel, not issuer. "They want to do this, but at arm's length"
- Focus: **creator payouts** and **~$100 cross-border transfers**
- New wallet implementation planned
- Meta officially denied "re-entering" the stablecoin business — framing as payments integration

**Scale:** 3.5B daily active users — if adopted, instantly the largest stablecoin payments network globally.

**History:** Meta's 2019 Libra project (later rebranded Diem) was killed by regulatory opposition. [[Kevin Weil]] co-created Libra during his 2018-2021 tenure at Facebook/Novi. Diem assets sold to Silvergate for $182M in Jan 2022.

**Regulatory context:** Friendlier US crypto environment under Trump. Congress actively working on stablecoin legislation. OCC granting bank charters to crypto firms.

**Open questions:** Which stablecoins supported, onchain vs abstracted payouts, wallet custody model, non-US markets first as regulatory sandbox.

## GPU deployment bottleneck

Meta is the clearest example of "shipped ≠ deployed" — see [[GPU deployment bottleneck]].

**CIP surge (Q3'24 → Q3'25: +$20.7B YoY):**

| Quarter | CIP Balance | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Q3 2022 | $23.6B | Included office facilities |
| Q3 2023 | $22.9B | First time DC/servers only |
| Q3 2024 | $23.3B | Baseline |
| Q4 2024 | $26.8B | Surge begins |
| Q1 2025 | $32.4B | +$5.6B QoQ |
| Q2 2025 | $36.0B | +$3.6B QoQ |
| Q3 2025 | **$44.0B** | +$8B QoQ, excludes Hyperion |

**10-K disclosure:** "servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required" — $1.4B in Dec 2023, $2.2B in Dec 2022.

## Socrates South power generation (Jan 2026)

**Meta building 200MW+ on-site gas power generation:**

| Equipment | Units | MW each | Total |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| [[Solar Turbines]] [[Titan]] 250 IGT | 3 | 23 MW | 69 MW |
| [[Solar Turbines]] [[Titan]] 130 IGT | 9 | 16.5 MW | 148.5 MW |
| [[Siemens Energy]] SGT-400 IGT | 3 | 14.3 MW | 42.9 MW |
| [[Caterpillar]] 3520 fast-start | 15 | 3.1 MW | 46.5 MW |
| **Gross total** | | | **~307 MW** |

**Design:** N+1+1 redundancy → operational capacity 200MW+

**Key insight:** Hybrid fleet (4 turbine types) diversifies supplier risk. Solar Turbines is a [[Caterpillar]] subsidiary — essentially 2 vendors ([[Caterpillar]] + [[Siemens]]).

**Pattern:** Another [[BYOP]] example — Meta joining OpenAI in on-site generation. See [[Power constraints]].

## Data center portfolio (Q3 2025)

**On-balance-sheet (~$12.3-13.5B in CIP):**

| Project | Location | Est. CIP | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| Prometheus | Ohio | $0.8-1.0B | Active, 1GW, H100/B200, 2026 |
| Cheyenne | Wyoming | ~$0.8B | Peak Build, 800k sq ft |
| Jeffersonville | Indiana | ~$0.8B | Liquid-cooled redesign |
| Kuna | Idaho | ~$0.9B | Active, ~960k sq ft |
| El Paso | Texas | $1.5B | Early, "Superintelligence" site |
| Montgomery | Alabama | $1.5B | Peak Build (up from $800M) |
| Expansions | Various | ~$6.0B | Temple TX, Rosemount MN |

**Off-balance-sheet:**

| Project | Location | Meta Share | Structure |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Hyperion** | Louisiana | $6B | $30B SPV with [[Blue Owl]], Meta 20% equity |

**Hyperion (Louisiana):**
- 5GW eventual capacity
- **$50B total** (per Trump announcement)
- "Nearly the size of Manhattan" — Zuckerberg
- First phase 2028
- **Not included in $44B CIP**

## Stock-based compensation

Meta has the worst [[Stock-based compensation|SBC]] sterilization ratio among Mag 7. Over 10 years, **82% of $148B in buybacks** merely offset dilution from equity grants — only 18% actually reduced the float (3.9% net reduction).

| Year | SBC Expense | % Revenue | Buyback $ |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2023 | $14.0B | 10.4% | $20.0B |
| 2024 | $16.7B | 10.1% | $29.7B |
| 2025 | $20.4B | 10.2% | $30.1B |

**SBC-adjusted FCF (2025):** $43.6B reported − $20.4B SBC = ~$23.2B. At ~$1.7T market cap, that's a ~1.4% adjusted FCF yield vs. ~2.6% headline.

### Mag 7 SBC comparison (most recent full year)

| Company | Period | SBC | FCF | Adj FCF | Mkt Cap | FCF Yield | Adj Yield | SBC/Buybacks |
|---------|--------|-----|-----|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| [[Apple]] | FY25 (Sep) | $12.9B | $98.8B | $85.9B | $4.0T | 2.5% | 2.2% | 14% |
| [[NVIDIA]] | FY26 (Jan) | $6.4B | $96.7B | $90.3B | $4.5T | 2.1% | 2.0% | 16% |
| [[Microsoft]] | FY25 (Jun) | $12.0B | $71.6B | $59.6B | $3.0T | 2.4% | 2.0% | 65% |
| [[Alphabet]] | CY25 | $25.0B | $73.3B | $48.3B | $3.7T | 2.0% | 1.3% | 55% |
| **[[Meta]]** | **CY25** | **$20.4B** | **$43.6B** | **$23.2B** | **$1.7T** | **2.6%** | **1.4%** | **68%** |
| [[Amazon]] | CY25 | $19.5B | $7.7B | −$11.8B | $2.2T | 0.3% | neg | no buybacks |
| [[Tesla]] | CY25 | $2.8B | $6.2B | $3.4B | $1.5T | 0.4% | 0.2% | no buybacks |

*Adj FCF = FCF − SBC. SBC/Buybacks = % of buybacks that merely offset dilution. Market caps as of Feb 26, 2026. Sources: company 10-K/10-Q filings via StockAnalysis.*

Among companies actively managing dilution through buybacks, Meta has the worst sterilization ratio — 68% of its $30.1B in repurchases merely offset SBC grants, vs. 14% at [[Apple]] and 16% at [[NVIDIA]]. [[Alphabet]] ($25.0B) has the largest SBC in absolute terms but better sterilization thanks to larger buybacks. [[Amazon]]'s SBC ($19.5B) exceeds its FCF ($7.7B), making adjusted FCF negative — masked by its decision not to buy back shares.

**Equity award cuts:** Meta cut stock awards ~5% in Feb 2026 (after 10% cut in 2025), redirecting savings to AI capex. May accelerate employee churn to competitors.

**Why Meta borrows despite profitability:** Debt is partly to fund buybacks needed to sterilize SBC. Interest on AA-rated debt (~4-5%) is cheaper and tax-deductible vs. the dilution cost of letting SBC flow through. This explains the zero-to-$59B debt trajectory since 2021.

---

## Debt profile

$59B face value across 20 tranches (Dec 2025) + $27.3B off-balance-sheet Hyperion SPV. Rated AA-/Aa3. Went from zero debt to $59B in 3.5 years. Net cash position ~$22.6B. See [[Meta bonds]] for full inventory.

## $60B financing (Oct 2025)

**Largest AI capital raise in history:**

| Tranche | Size | Structure | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| **SPV (off-balance-sheet)** | $30B | [[Morgan Stanley]] → Blue Owl | Largest private capital deal ever |
| **Corporate bonds** | $30B | Investment-grade | Largest IG offering of 2025 |

**Why off-balance-sheet matters:**
- Preserves debt capacity for M&A
- Avoids earnings volatility from construction
- Maintains credit ratings
- Meta only responsible for lease payments, not construction risk

**[[Moody's]] accounting gap warning (Feb 25, 2026):** The Hyperion SPV ("Beignet Investor") has a 4-year initial lease with options to renew up to 20 years, plus a **$28B residual value guarantee** if Meta doesn't renew and property value falls. None of this appears on Meta's balance sheet — GAAP thresholds ("reasonably certain" for renewal, "probable" for RVG) mean neither scenario triggers recognition. Meta's filing: "RVG payments are not probable and therefore, no liability has been recorded." Moody's will make independent probability adjustments for credit ratings.

**Context:** [[Morgan Stanley]] estimates $1.5T total external AI financing needed, $800B via private credit by 2028.

See [[AI infrastructure financing]].

**CFO warning:** Depreciation spike coming in 2026-2027 when CIP assets activate. Currently in "buy now, deploy later" mode.
