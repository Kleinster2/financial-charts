**Meta (Facebook)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, massive NVIDIA buyer, open-source AI leader (Llama).

---

## Relevance to semis

Meta is one of the largest NVIDIA GPU buyers. Their AI capex flows directly to [[TSMC]] via NVIDIA.

---

## Chip strategy

- Heavy [[NVIDIA]] dependency (350K H100s)
- MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) — custom inference chip, now developing training chip
- Testing first in-house training chip (RISC-V based, Mar 2025)
- Open-source AI (Llama) drives broader GPU demand ecosystem

---

## AI leadership

**Alexandr Wang** (Scale AI founder) hired summer 2025 to lead Meta AI efforts. Now recruiting aggressively including Manus team.

**Vision:** Zuckerberg racing to build "personal superintelligence"

## 2025 AI acquisitions

| Acquisition | Price | What |
|-------------|-------|------|
| **Manus** | ~$2B+ | AI agents (Chinese-founded) |
| **Rivos** | ~$2B | Custom chip design (RISC-V) |
| PlayAI | — | AI audio |
| WaveForms | — | AI audio |
| Limitless | — | Wearables |

**Manus (Jan 2026):**
- Chinese-founded AI agent startup (~100 staff)
- Meta's 3rd largest acquisition ever (after Instagram, WhatsApp)
- "Leading autonomous general-purpose agent"
- Was "hailed as the next DeepSeek"
- Parent company Butterfly Effect backed by Benchmark (drew China hawk criticism)
- Deal closed in ~10 days
- Signals aggressive catch-up in [[Agentic AI]]

**Geopolitical angle:**
- Rare US acquisition of cutting-edge Chinese AI
- Brain drain concerns: "An incredible company and team are being sold to the United States"
- Could raise hackles in Washington AND Beijing

---

## Monetization

- Exploring premium subscriptions for Meta AI assistant
- Pressure to justify $65B AI capex
- Manus gives them actual agent product to monetize

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI capex | **$65B** (2025 budget) |
| H100 GPUs | 350,000 |
| Primary chip | [[NVIDIA]] GPUs |
| Foundry exposure | [[TSMC]] (via NVIDIA) |
| 2025 AI M&A | ~$4B+ (Manus + Rivos) |
| AI lead | Alexandr Wang (ex-Scale AI) |

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: NVIDIA GPUs = TSMC
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Tier 1 spender, validates AI capex cycle
**[[Agentic AI]]**: Manus acquisition = competitive pressure on [[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]]
**[[Long Anthropic]]**: Meta now a direct competitor in agents
