## WallStreetBets and meme stock legacy (Jan 2026)

Five years after [[GameStop]], Reddit's investment communities remain a major force:

| Metric | Growth (end 2020 → end 2025) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Personal finance posts/comments | **+117%** |
| Investment interest posts/comments | **+49%** |

Investment interest is led by WallStreetBets and Superstonk but also includes r/stocks and r/investing.

**Institutional adoption:** [[Fidelity]] now operates its own investment forum on Reddit — "a massive difference that you wouldn't have seen in 2021" (Rob Gaige, Reddit global head of Insights). Brands once shunned are now "adding tremendous value."
