**PBOC** (People's Bank of China) — China's central bank. Controls monetary policy, RMB exchange rate, and banking regulation. Key actor in managing China's economic transition from investment-led growth.

---

## Mandate

Unlike Western central banks with explicit inflation targets, PBOC balances multiple objectives:
- Price stability
- Economic growth
- Employment
- Financial stability
- Exchange rate management

The multi-objective mandate gives PBOC flexibility but creates ambiguity about policy reaction functions.

## Key policy rates

| Rate | Current | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **1-year LPR** | 3.10% | Loan Prime Rate, benchmark for most loans |
| **5-year LPR** | 3.60% | Benchmark for mortgages |
| **1-year MLF** | 2.00% | Medium-term Lending Facility, sets LPR floor |
| **7-day reverse repo** | 1.50% | Short-term liquidity rate |

LPR held unchanged for 8 consecutive months through Jan 2026.

## Liquidity tools

### Open market operations

| Tool | Tenor | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Reverse repo** | 7-day, 14-day | Daily liquidity management |
| **MLF** | 1-year | Medium-term funding for banks |
| **Outright reverse repo** | Monthly | Structural liquidity (new tool, 2024) |
| **PSL** | Multi-year | Pledged Supplementary Lending for policy banks |

### January 2026 injection

PBOC injected net **1 trillion yuan** ($144B) via MLF and outright reverse repo — record monthly injection. Crushed short-term funding costs, with 1-year [[China NCD|NCD]] yields falling to ~1.6%.

**Mechanism:** Excess liquidity + weak loan demand = banks deploy cash into government bonds, compressing long-end yields.

---

## Balance sheet size

~45 trillion yuan (~$6.2T). Unlike Fed/ECB, PBOC's balance sheet grew modestly relative to economy since 2015 as it shifted from FX reserve accumulation to domestic tools.

---

## Exchange rate management

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Daily fix** | Sets CNY midpoint each morning |
| **Band** | CNY trades within 2% of fix |
| **FX reserves** | ~$3.2T, down from $4T peak (2014) |
| **Capital controls** | Limit outflows, QFII/RQFII for inflows |

PBOC manages RMB depreciation pressure during rate differentials with US. Counter-cyclical factor in daily fixing dampens speculative moves.

---

## Relationship to government

PBOC reports to State Council (cabinet), not independent like Fed. Governor [[Pan Gongsheng]] coordinates with [[NDRC]], Ministry of Finance on stimulus. Fiscal-monetary coordination is explicit, not taboo.

---

## 2025-2026 policy stance

**"Moderately loose"** — first use of this language since 2008 financial crisis.

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Rate cuts | Limited room (spread to US rates) |
| RRR cuts | More likely tool |
| Liquidity | Ample (record Jan 2026 injection) |
| FX | Managed depreciation pressure |

---

## Bank funding cost dynamics (Feb 2026)

PBOC's record liquidity injection created a carry opportunity for banks:

| Metric | Level |
|--------|-------|
| 1-year NCD yield | ~1.6% |
| 30-year CGB yield | ~2.3% |
| Spread | ~60+ bps (widest since 2022) |

Banks flush with cash from PBOC + weak loan demand = bid for duration. Regulatory loosening of interest rate risk measures (per Basel standards) expanded banks' capacity for long-dated bonds.

See [[China NCD]] for funding mechanics.

## Why it matters

- PBOC liquidity injections directly impact global risk appetite
- CNY weakness/strength affects EM FX broadly
- Rate decisions signal China growth outlook
- Government bond yields reflect deflation/growth expectations
