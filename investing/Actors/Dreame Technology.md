## EV Pivot (announced 2025-2026)

**Dreame is entering the electric vehicle market** — following the Xiaomi playbook.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target launch | **2027** |
| Vehicle type | Electric luxury supercars |
| Concept car | "Nebula" flagship — Bugatti-style EV sedan |
| CES 2026 | Unveiled EV prototypes (Jan 2026) |
| Super Bowl ad | $10M 30-second spot (Feb 9, 2026) |
| Manufacturing | Plant planned in **Brandenburg, Germany** |
| Team | ~1,000 automotive professionals being assembled |
| Goal | "World's fastest car" |

**The Xiaomi parallel:** Xiaomi (early Dreame investor) successfully entered EVs with the SU7 in 2024. Dreame appears to be following the same tech-company-to-car-company playbook.

**Key challenge:** Chinese EVs face **100% tariffs** in the US market. Brandenburg plant could be a tariff-avoidance strategy for European market access.

---

## CVC Fund

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fund size | **$1.5B** |
| Launched | Aug 2025 |
| LPs | Dreame, Chinese local governments, SOEs, family offices |
| Notable LP | Guosheng Fund (Xiamen city government) |

Significant CVC activity for a pre-IPO company — signals ambition beyond home appliances.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Dominant position in fast-growing robot vacuum market
- iRobot bankruptcy removes key Western competitor
- 139% Europe revenue growth shows international traction
- EV pivot leverages core motor/AI competencies
- Xiaomi ecosystem distribution advantage
- $1.5B CVC fund for strategic investments

**Bear:**
- Still private — no public equity access
- EV market is brutally competitive (especially from China)
- 100% US tariff on Chinese EVs
- Vacuum → supercar is an enormous leap
- $10M Super Bowl ad for a car that doesn't exist yet — marketing ahead of product
- Brandenburg plant may face political pushback (see: Tesla Grünheide)

---

## Key questions

- When/where will Dreame IPO? (Shanghai STAR board rumored)
- Can they actually build a competitive EV, or is this vaporware marketing?
- Will EU tariffs on Chinese EVs tighten further?
- How much of the CVC fund is diversification vs. EV supply chain building?
