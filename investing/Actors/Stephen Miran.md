| Oct 2025 | **Dissent** (50bp cut) | — |
| Dec 2025 | **Dissent** (50bp cut) | — |
| Jan 2026 | **Dissent** (25bp cut) | Moderated to 25bp; joined [[Chris Waller]] |

## Controversy

**Dual role concern:**
- First Fed Governor to simultaneously hold executive branch position since 1930s
- Took "unpaid leave" from CEA — still technically an employee of the president
- Critics: undermines [[Fed independence]]
- Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted no specifically on independence grounds

**Expiring term:**
- Miran's term ends Jan 31, 2026 — just days after Jan 29 FOMC
- Filled unexpired seat left by [[Adriana Kugler]] (who resigned Aug 2025)
- Unclear if Trump will renominate for full term
