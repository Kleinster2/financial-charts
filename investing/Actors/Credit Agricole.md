## Cooperative structure

Crédit Agricole's structure is unusual among listed banks:

1. 7.4M mutual shareholders own shares in ~2,400 local banks (Caisses Locales)
2. Caisses Locales own the 39 Caisses Régionales (regional banks)
3. Caisses Régionales collectively own 60.7% of Crédit Agricole S.A. via SAS Rue La Boétie
4. Crédit Agricole S.A. (CASA) is the listed entity that owns the specialized subsidiaries

The free float (~39%) trades on Euronext Paris. CASA controls the business lines, but the regional banks are the dominant shareholder and operate French retail independently. This structure creates governance complexity — CASA cannot unilaterally restructure the regional network.

## Business segments (FY2024, CASA stated)

### Asset Gathering — EUR 7,648M revenue (+14.4%)

| Sub-segment | Revenue | Net income | Key metric |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Insurance (CA Assurances) | EUR 2,845M (+11.9%) | EUR 1,884M (+14%) | EUR 43.6B premiums, 16.7M P&C contracts |
| Asset management ([[Amundi]]) | EUR 3,406M (+9.1%) | EUR 849M (+11.7%) | EUR 2,240B AUM (record) |
| Wealth management (Indosuez) | EUR 1,397M (+36.6%) | EUR 142M (+11.1%) | EUR 279B AUM (+47% with Degroof Petercam) |

Largest contributor to CASA net income (38%). [[Amundi]] is Europe's largest asset manager. Insurance cross-sell into the regional bank network is a structural advantage — 43.9% P&C equipment rate in Caisses Régionales.

### Large Customers — EUR 8,651M revenue (+11.2%)

| Sub-segment | Revenue | Net income | Key metric |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|
| CIB (CACIB) | EUR 6,568M (+7.6%) | EUR 2,152M (+22.7%) | EUR 21.7B green loan portfolio (+75% since 2022) |
| Asset servicing (CACEIS) | EUR 2,083M (+24.2%) | EUR 296M (+15.1%) | Custody/fund administration |

Record year for CIB. CACEIS growth driven by consolidation of additional activities.

### French Retail Banking (LCL) — EUR 3,827M revenue

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net income | EUR 576M |
| Customers | 6M+ |
| Home loan production | +59.3% YoY |
| New customers Q4 | 60,000 |

LCL is the centrally-managed French retail brand (distinct from the 39 regional banks which are not consolidated line-by-line in CASA).

### International Retail Banking

| Market | Outstandings | Key metric |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| [[Italy]] (CA Italia) | EUR 62.1B (+1.7%) | 6.1M customers, 5% market share |
| [[Poland]] | Growing | Loan outstandings +3.8% |
| [[Egypt]] | Operational | — |
| [[Ukraine]] | Operational | — |

Italy is the largest international market. Crédit Agricole holds a ~19.8% stake in [[Banco BPM]] (via derivatives, increased Dec 2024), which has been the subject of M&A speculation.

### Specialized Financial Services — EUR 3,511M revenue (-2.2%)

| Sub-segment | Revenue | Net income |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Personal Finance & Mobility (CAPFM/CA Auto Bank) | EUR 2,764M | EUR 422M |
| Leasing & Factoring (CAL&F) | EUR 756M (+6.8%) | EUR 203M (+15.0%) |

Decline driven by base effects from mobility business reorganization. Consumer finance outstandings EUR 119.3B.

## Recent developments

- Banco BPM stake buildup — increased economic interest to ~19.8% via derivatives (Dec 2024), creating potential for full Italian retail consolidation or a blocking position against [[UniCredit]]'s competing bid
- Worldline investment — acquired 7% stake in Jan 2024 as payments strategic play
- Degroof Petercam acquisition — closed in 2024, boosting Indosuez AUM by ~47% to EUR 279B
- Ambitions 2025 plan exceeded — hit all financial targets one year early (ROTE, revenues, cost/income)
- Moody's downgrade — Dec 2024, Aa3 → A1, following French sovereign downgrade (political turmoil). S&P and Fitch held at A+
- Green lending — CIB green loan portfolio reached EUR 21.7B, up 75% since end-2022
- Record CIB — best-ever year for capital markets and investment banking revenues

## Risks

- French sovereign/political risk — Moody's downgrade shows direct sovereign linkage. Further French fiscal deterioration could pressure ratings and funding costs
- Italian exposure — EUR 62B+ loan book plus Banco BPM stake creates significant Italian concentration. Economic downturn or sovereign stress in [[Italy]] would hit hard
- Interest rate sensitivity — falling Eurozone rates compress NII in retail banking; rising rates hurt bond portfolios
- Cooperative governance — Caisses Régionales hold 60.7% of CASA and operate independently. CASA cannot fully control the distribution network or force restructuring
- Banco BPM optionality risk — 19.8% stake could become stranded if [[UniCredit]] completes competing bid, or require capital-intensive full acquisition
- Consumer finance — CAPFM business declining amid mobility restructuring and competitive pressure
- Concentration in France — despite international presence, French operations dominate. French real estate downturn or consumer stress is the primary risk factor

## Financials (annual, CASA stated)

![[aca.pa-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue growth steady post-COVID, reaching EUR 27.2B in 2024. Net income recovered from EUR 2.7B (2020) to record EUR 7.1B (2024).*

| Year | Revenue (EUR B) | Net Income (EUR B) | ROTE |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------|
| 2024 | 27.2 | 7.1 | 14.0% |
| 2023 | 24.6 | 6.3 | 13.4% |
| 2022 | 23.5 | 5.3 | 12.2% |
| 2021 | 23.0 | 5.8 | 13.2% |
| 2020 | 20.0 | 2.7 | 7.2% |

![[aca.pa-vs-bnp.pa-vs-ucg.mi-price-chart.png]]
*[[UniCredit]] has massively outperformed European bank peers since 2020. Crédit Agricole and [[BNP Paribas]] have tracked each other closely, both roughly doubling.*

---

## Investability

Publicly traded on Euronext Paris (ACA). Market cap ~EUR 45-50B. Dividend yield ~4-5%. Also available as ADR (CRARY on OTC in US). The cooperative structure means CASA trades at a discount to book — the regional banks capture a significant share of French retail economics that CASA only partially consolidates. ROTE of 14% is strong for a European universal bank.
