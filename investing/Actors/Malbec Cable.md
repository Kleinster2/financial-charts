## Strategic importance

**For [[Scala Data Centers]]:**
- Scala AI City in Eldorado do Sul (near Porto Alegre) uses Malbec for US connectivity
- Enables <80ms latency to North America
- Critical for hyperscaler workloads requiring low-latency US access

**For Argentina:**
- First new submarine cable since 2001
- NERA estimated 6% increase in internet penetration
- Connects Buenos Aires directly to US markets
