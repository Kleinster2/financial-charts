## The off-price model

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Buying power** | Buys excess inventory from brands at 40-60% off |
| **Treasure hunt** | Changing inventory creates urgency, repeat visits |
| **Low marketing** | Word-of-mouth, no heavy ad spend |
| **Real estate flexibility** | Second-tier locations, low rent |
| **Inventory turn** | High velocity, low markdown risk |

**Why it works:** Brands need liquidation channels. Department stores declining means more excess inventory. Value-seeking consumers = secular tailwind.

## Competitive position

| Factor | TJX | Ross Stores | Burlington |
|--------|-----|-------------|------------|
| Revenue | $56B | $21B | $10B |
| Stores | 5,000+ | 2,100+ | 1,000+ |
| Margin | ~12% pretax | ~12% | ~8% |
| International | Yes ([[Europe]], [[Australia]]) | No | No |

TJX is 2.5x larger than #2 (Ross). Scale = buying power advantage.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Structural winner: department store decline = more inventory supply
- [[Consumer]] value-seeking secular trend
- 4% comps, 10% EPS growth — consistent compounder
- International expansion ([[Europe]] underpenetrated)
- 5,000th store milestone — room for more
- $4.1B returned to shareholders (FY25)

**Bear:**
- ~30x PE — priced for perfection
- [[Shein]]/Temu competition for value-seeking consumers
- Inventory supply risk if brands cut production
- HomeGoods slower (home category softness)
- 4% comps may be peak (tough comps ahead)
- Tariffs could reduce brand overproduction
