## Nickel dominance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global mine production share | 55% |
| 2021-2025 production growth | ~50% of global growth |
| Chinese investment | $65B+ over decade |
| Chinese control | ~90% of mines & processing |

**Ore export ban (2020):** Banned raw nickel exports to force downstream processing. Mixed results — attracted Chinese investment but deterred Western buyers.

## Battery manufacturing

| Project | Investment | Capacity | Status |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| [[CATL]] Karawang | $6B | 6.9 GWh (→40 GWh) | Ops end-2026 |
| Merdeka Battery HPAL | $1.8B | 90K tons high-purity nickel | 2026 |
| Hyundai-LG JV | | 150K EVs/yr battery cells | Opened July 2024 |
| MIND ID integrated | $5.9B | 55K tons MHP + 88K tons Ni | Building |

Four Indonesian nickel companies expanding 470,000 tonnes capacity by 2026.

## Setbacks

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| BASF withdrawal (2024) | Dropped refinery over ESG concerns |
| Tesla rejection | Musk declined factory — logistics |
| Nickel price crash | $14,550/t, 4-year lows |
| LME inventory surge | +90,000 tonnes (2025) |

Oversupply from Indonesian expansion crashing global nickel prices.
