Google DeepMind — Google's AI research lab. Merged DeepMind ([[UK]]) + Google Brain (US). Created AlphaGo, AlphaFold, [[Gemini]].

---

## Why Google DeepMind matters

GDM is Google's frontier AI effort:

| Achievement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| AlphaGo (2016) | Beat world Go champion |
| AlphaFold (2020) | Solved protein folding |
| [[Gemini]] (2023+) | Multimodal LLM family |
| Gemma | Open-source models |

---

## History

Two labs merged (2023):

| Lab | Origin | Strength |
|-----|--------|----------|
| DeepMind | [[UK]], acquired 2014 for $500M | Research, RL, science |
| Google Brain | US, internal | Scale, infrastructure |

Leader: Demis Hassabis (DeepMind founder) now leads combined entity.

## [[Gemini]] model family

Google's answer to GPT:

| Model | Use case |
|-------|----------|
| [[Gemini]] Ultra | Frontier, largest |
| [[Gemini]] Pro | Production workloads |
| [[Gemini]] Nano | On-device |
| [[Gemini]] Flash | Fast, cheap inference |

Distribution: Google Search, Android, Cloud, Workspace.

## vs OpenAI

| Aspect | Google DeepMind | [[OpenAI]] |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Funding | Google parent | VC + [[Microsoft]] |
| Distribution | Google products (billions) | API, [[ChatGPT]] |
| Research | Stronger (AlphaFold) | Strong |
| Products | [[Gemini]], Bard, Search | [[ChatGPT]], API |
| Open source | Gemma | Limited |

Google's advantage: Distribution to billions through Search, Android, Gmail.

## Key people

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| [[Demis Hassabis]] | CEO (DeepMind founder) |
| Jeff Dean | Chief Scientist |
| Koray Kavukcuoglu | VP Research |

## Scientific achievements

Beyond chatbots:

| Project | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| AlphaFold | Protein structure prediction (Nobel-adjacent) |
| AlphaGo/Zero | Reinforcement learning breakthrough |
| Gato | Generalist agent (2022) |
| GraphCast | Weather prediction |
| [[Genie 3]] (2026) | World-building AI -- generates interactive virtual environments from text prompts |

GDM is more research-oriented than OpenAI.

### [[Genie 3]] (Feb 2026)

World model that constructs virtual environments from text prompts. Triggered selloff in game dev/graphics companies when demos released.

Applications beyond gaming:
- [[Waymo]]: customized for autonomous driving simulation — generates synthetic driving footage and lidar-like depth data for edge-case training
- Robotics: potential for sim-to-real transfer
- Content creation: virtual world generation

## Investment angle

Not directly investable — part of Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG).

Google's AI capabilities are underappreciated:
- Distribution advantage (Search, Android)
- TPU infrastructure
- Talent depth
- Scientific research lead

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Division of Alphabet |
| Parent ticker | GOOGL/GOOG |
| Employees | 2,000+ |
| HQ | London (DeepMind), Mountain View (Brain) |
| Compute | TPU pods, Google Cloud |
