# ASML (ASML)

Dutch semiconductor equipment company with a monopoly on EUV lithography.

---

## Core thesis

ASML is the most critical bottleneck in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. No EUV = no leading edge chips. 20+ years of R&D created an unassailable moat.

---

## The monopoly

| Technology | ASML position | Alternative |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| EUV lithography | 100% share | None |
| DUV lithography | ~85% share | Nikon, Canon (trailing) |
| High-NA EUV | 100% share | None |

Every leading edge chip (sub-7nm) requires ASML EUV machines. Period.

---

## Why the moat is durable

- **20+ years of R&D**: Can't be replicated quickly
- **Supply chain control**: Key suppliers (Zeiss optics, Cymer light source) locked in
- **Institutional knowledge**: Thousands of engineers, decades of iteration
- **Customer co-development**: TSMC, Intel, Samsung helped fund development

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Largest — priority access to new tools |
| [[Samsung]] | Major — needs EUV for leading edge |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Growing — 18A/20A ramp |
| Chinese fabs | Restricted — no EUV allowed |

---

## China exposure / risk

- U.S. export controls block EUV sales to China
- DUV restrictions tightening
- Reduces TAM but protects Western customers' lead
- China developing domestic alternatives (SMEE) — years behind

## Rare earth supply chain risk

High-NA EUV machines require precision magnets made with [[Dysprosium]] and [[Terbium]]:

| Component | REE dependency |
|-----------|----------------|
| Wafer stage | Dy/Tb magnets for nm-precision positioning |
| Reticle stage | Dy/Tb magnets for mask alignment |
| Actuators | High-temp stable permanent magnets |

**Risk**: China controls 99% of Dy/Tb processing. Export restrictions could bottleneck ASML's High-NA production — creating a second chokepoint beyond ASML's own monopoly.

**Mitigation (Dec 2025)**: REAlloys $21M SRC deal to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027 — specifically targeting semiconductor equipment magnets.

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for geopolitical context.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ASML (NASDAQ, Euronext) |
| EUV share | 100% |
| Machine cost | $150-350M per EUV tool |
| High-NA EUV | $350M+, ramping 2024-2025 |

## For theses

- [[Long WFE]] — crown jewel, monopoly position
- [[Long TSMC]] — ASML enables TSMC's leading edge moat
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — Samsung needs ASML too; equipment is neutral
