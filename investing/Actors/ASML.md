# ASML (ASML)

Dutch semiconductor equipment company with a monopoly on EUV lithography.

---

## Core thesis

ASML is the most critical bottleneck in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. No EUV = no leading edge chips. 20+ years of R&D created an unassailable moat.

---

## The monopoly

| Technology | ASML position | Alternative |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| EUV lithography | 100% share | None |
| DUV lithography | ~85% share | Nikon, Canon (trailing) |
| High-NA EUV | 100% share | None |

Every leading edge chip (sub-7nm) requires ASML EUV machines. Period.

---

## Why the moat is durable

- **20+ years of R&D**: Can't be replicated quickly
- **Supply chain control**: Key suppliers (Zeiss optics, Cymer light source) locked in
- **Institutional knowledge**: Thousands of engineers, decades of iteration
- **Customer co-development**: TSMC, Intel, Samsung helped fund development

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Largest — priority access to new tools |
| [[Samsung]] | Major — needs EUV for leading edge |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Growing — 18A/20A ramp |
| Chinese fabs | Restricted — no EUV allowed |

---

## China exposure / risk

- U.S. export controls block EUV sales to China
- DUV restrictions tightening
- Reduces TAM but protects Western customers' lead
- China developing domestic alternatives (SMEE) — years behind

## Rare earth supply chain risk

High-NA EUV machines require precision magnets made with [[Dysprosium]] and [[Terbium]]:

| Component | REE dependency |
|-----------|----------------|
| Wafer stage | Dy/Tb magnets for nm-precision positioning |
| Reticle stage | Dy/Tb magnets for mask alignment |
| Actuators | High-temp stable permanent magnets |

**Risk**: China controls 99% of Dy/Tb processing. Export restrictions could bottleneck ASML's High-NA production — creating a second chokepoint beyond ASML's own monopoly.

**Mitigation (Dec 2025)**: REAlloys $21M SRC deal to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027 — specifically targeting semiconductor equipment magnets.

## $500B milestone (Jan 2026)

**Third European company ever to reach $500B market cap:**

| Rank | Company | Sector |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | LVMH | Luxury |
| 2 | Novo Nordisk | Pharma |
| 3 | **ASML** | Semiconductors |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | **€453B ($527B)** |
| YTD 2026 | **+24%** |
| Status | Record high, Europe's most valuable |

**Catalyst:** [[TSMC]] 2026 capex guidance of $56B (above expectations) — validates sustained AI spending.

**Barclays (Emmanuel Cau):**
> "The milestone means a lot for the market sentimentally. Europe is a small market, so if ASML as a major stock goes up, the broader market will automatically benefit. The rally in ASML also gives European investors a gateway to play the mainstream AI trade."

**Next:** Q4 2025 earnings Jan 28, 2026.

## For theses

- [[Long WFE]] — crown jewel, monopoly position
- [[Long TSMC]] — ASML enables TSMC's leading edge moat
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — Samsung needs ASML too; equipment is neutral
