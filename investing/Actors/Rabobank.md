## Risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Dutch real estate concentration | EUR 195.7B residential mortgage exposure; 19% market share. Dutch house prices rose 8.7% in 2024, expected +8.8% in 2025. Housing shortage (~401,000 homes) supports prices but affordability strains could trigger correction |
| Agricultural commodity cycles | EUR 119.8B food & agri portfolio exposed to commodity price swings, crop failures, trade disruptions, disease outbreaks |
| Interest rate sensitivity | H1 2025 already showed NII pressure from lower rates; deposit margin compression ongoing |
| Cooperative governance | No equity capital markets access; relies on retained earnings and hybrid instruments for capital. Cannot raise equity in a crisis the way listed banks can |
| Brazil risk | DLL elevated impairments in 2024 from Brazil; recurring EM exposure through agri lending |
| Regulatory | Dutch Affordable Rent Act (Jul 2024) disrupting rental market; investor sell-off of rental properties. CSRD/ESG reporting costs increasing |
| Concentration risk | Heavily concentrated in Netherlands domestically (~85-90% of Dutch agrarian sector) and in food/agri globally |
| Climate/nature risk | Long-term exposure to climate change impacts on agriculture; nitrogen crisis in Netherlands affecting farming clients |
| AML/compliance | Historically fined (Libor scandal 2013, EUR 774M). Ongoing investment in Financial Economic Crime departments |
