## EDS legacy

**Founded June 27, 1962** (his 32nd birthday):
- Started with $1,000 from wife Margot
- Pioneered "facilities management" — outsourced IT
- Medicare claims processing = early goldmine
- 1968 IPO made him billionaire at 38

**GM acquisition (1984)**: $2.4B — largest IT services deal ever at time.

**Culture clash**: Perot's lean culture vs GM bureaucracy. Famous quote: "The first EDSer to see a snake kills it. At GM, first thing you do is organize a committee on snakes."

**Buyout (1986)**: GM paid $700M+ to get Perot off the board.
