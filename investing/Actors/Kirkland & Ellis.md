# Kirkland & Ellis

World's largest law firm by revenue ($8.8B in 2024). Dominates private equity and restructuring. The go-to firm for [[Apollo]], [[Ares Management]], [[BlackRock]], [[KKR]], and most major PE shops — which creates conflicts when borrowers and lenders clash.

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (2024) | $8.8B |
| YoY growth | +22% |
| Profits per partner | $9.25M |
| Rank | #1 Am Law 200, #1 Global 200 |
| Gap to #2 (Latham) | $1.8B |

First law firm to hit $7B revenue. Litigation practice alone now ~$3B.

## PE Dominance

Strategic pivot to private equity in early 2000s proved prescient. Now represents virtually every major PE firm, fund, and portfolio company in buyouts, restructurings, and exits.

**H1 2025**: Advised on 225 transactions worth $190B, including five mega-deals over $10B.

Core practices:
- Private equity M&A
- Leveraged finance
- Restructuring/bankruptcy
- Fund formation
- High-stakes litigation

## The Altice Conflict

**Sep 2025**: [[Altice]] (Optimum) hired Kirkland + Evercore to advise on $26B debt restructuring.

**Nov 2025**: Altice filed antitrust lawsuit alleging "illegal cartel" among creditors — [[Apollo]], [[Ares Management]], [[BlackRock]].

**Post-filing**: Kirkland withdrew. All three defendants are major Kirkland clients. Kellogg Hansen (antitrust boutique) had architected the lawsuit.
