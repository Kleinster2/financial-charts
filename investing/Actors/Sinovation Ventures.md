## The Sinovation model

```
Kai-Fu Lee network → Deal flow
        ↓
AI-first thesis → Investment
        ↓
Operational support → Incubation
        ↓
Exit (IPO/acquisition) → Returns
```

**Incubation approach:** Not just capital — provides office space, mentorship, hiring help. More hands-on than typical VC.

## Kai-Fu Lee as asset

The firm's edge is its founder:

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Network | Knows every AI founder in China |
| Reputation | Founders want his backing |
| Media presence | Millions of followers |
| Technical depth | Can evaluate AI claims |
| Global connections | Bridge to Silicon Valley |

- Investment signals validate AI trends
- Co-investors include major global funds

**Thesis implications:**
- AI VC in China is concentrated (few firms dominate)
- Sinovation portfolio = map of China AI ecosystem
