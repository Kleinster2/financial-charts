## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- Stargate anchor = decade of AI buildout
- $46.9B raised — ample capital for growth
- Premium hyperscale customer base
- Geographic diversification (5 continents)
- DigitalBridge/SoftBank backing

**Bear case:**
- Private = no direct investment path
- Execution risk on massive projects (1.4GW Texas, 902MW Wisconsin)
- Hyperscale customer concentration
- Power availability constraints

**Indirect exposure:** [[DigitalBridge]] (DBRG) — being acquired by [[SoftBank]] ($4B, Dec 2025).
