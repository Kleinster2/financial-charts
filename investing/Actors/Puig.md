## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Purest-play fragrance investment in public markets
- +11% LFL growth, 20% EBITDA margin
- Charlotte Tilbury = high-growth makeup franchise
- Fragrance category tailwind (+12% in 2024)
- IPO discount — stock -25% from listing, earnings normalized
- Family-controlled = long-term orientation

**Bear:**
- Stock -25% since IPO — momentum broken
- Dual-class shares — minority holders have no power
- Growth decelerating (26% → 19% → 11% → 6-8%E)
- Fragrance boom may normalize/fade
- No skincare franchise (highest-margin beauty category)
- Small vs L'Oréal, LVMH — lacks scale advantages
