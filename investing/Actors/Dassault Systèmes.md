## Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 11, 2026)

Stock crashed 18-21% — worst day in company history, ~€6B market cap destroyed:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY2025 |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | €1.682B (+1%) | €6.24B (+4% cc) |
| Software revenue | -5% QoQ | — |
| Non-IFRS op margin | 37.0% | 32.0% (+40bps) |
| Non-IFRS EPS | +9% | €1.31 (+7%) |
| IFRS EPS | — | €0.90 (flat) |
| Cash from ops | — | €1.63B |

Segment breakdown (FY2025 software revenue growth, cc):

| Segment | Growth | Note |
|---------|--------|------|
| Industrial Innovation | +4% | CATIA, DELMIA, SIMULIA — core CAD/manufacturing |
| Life Sciences | -4% | [[Medidata]] weakness, pharma spending pullback |
| Mainstream Innovation | +1% | [[SOLIDWORKS]], CENTRIC PLM |
| 3DEXPERIENCE | -3% | Platform migration stalling |
| Cloud | +9% | Only bright spot — but small base |

2026 guide missed badly: Revenue +3-5% (Street expected 5-7%), margin 32.2-32.6%, EPS €1.30-€1.34. [[UBS]] downgraded enterprise IT on same day.

Life sciences ([[Medidata]]) -4% FY — pharma capex weakness. Automotive weakness across Industrial Innovation. JPMorgan: "worse than even the most negative had feared."

Stock down >50% over 12 months — growth deceleration + [[AI disintermediation]] fears. Earnings call scheduled Feb 12-13.

## AI disintermediation vulnerability

Dassault is the biggest European casualty of the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]]. Industrial software (CAD/PLM/simulation) faces the same AI replacement risk as legal/financial data software. AI can increasingly generate 3D models, automate simulation workflows, and replace manual PLM processes.

CEO Daloz's response: "Dassault Systèmes will lead the Industrial AI transformation through 3D UNIV+RSES." Same playbook as every SaaS victim — promise to be the disruptor, not the disrupted.
