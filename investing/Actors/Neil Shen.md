# Neil Shen

Founding and managing partner of [[HongShan]] (HSG, formerly Sequoia Capital China). One of the most influential tech investors in history — backed virtually every major Chinese tech company over two decades at Sequoia. Now channeling **American institutional capital into Chinese AI labs**, creating a strategic paradox at the heart of US-China tech competition.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net worth | ~$5B+ (Forbes) |
| Firm | [[HongShan]] (HSG) |
| AUM | $56B |
| Key AI bets | [[MiniMax]], [[Moonshot AI]], [[StepFun]], [[Manus AI]] |
| Prior role | Managing partner, Sequoia Capital China (2005-2023) |
| Also backed | [[Unitree]], ByteDance, Meituan, Pinduoduo, JD.com |

## The play

Before US investment restrictions tightened, Shen raised **~$9B from American pension funds and endowments** for HSG. That capital is now funding the Chinese AI labs producing frontier-competitive models at a fraction of Western costs:

- **[[MiniMax]]** M2.5 — #1 on OpenRouter by token volume (3.07T), competitive with Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.2 on SWE-Bench
- **[[Moonshot AI]]** (Kimi K2.5) — #2 on OpenRouter (1.16T tokens)
- **[[Manus AI]]** — AI agent tool, invested at ~$85M valuation, acquired by [[Meta]] for $2B+
- **[[StepFun]]** — generative AI

The paradox: US capital funded the Chinese AI labs that are now eating into market share of the US labs that US policy is trying to protect. The regulations came after the money was already deployed.

HSG says its investments comply with current regulations — most portfolio companies focus on consumer AI or foundational research not covered by export controls.

## Evolution

- **2023-2024**: Raises $9B from US institutions before investment restrictions tighten. Pivots heavily into AI
- **2025-2026**: Portfolio companies ([[MiniMax]], [[Moonshot AI]]) dominate OpenRouter token volume, competing with Western frontier models
