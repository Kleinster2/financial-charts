## Funding source

Primary source: **Iranian oil sales.**

Officially, state-owned [[NIOC]] sells Iran's crude. But sanctions pushed trade into opaque channels — front companies, middlemen, informal traders. Elites connected to Supreme Leader and IRGC control these networks.

---

## Key relationships

### Ali Ansari — the money man

[[Ali Ansari]] is the primary account holder and intermediary for Mojtaba's offshore empire.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | Principal account holder, deal executor |
| Relationship | Met in late 1980s during Iran-Iraq War |
| Meetings | Private house in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district; Ayandeh Bank office |
| UK sanctions | October 2025 — freezes UK assets |

Ansari's Cyprus passport (2016) enabled new European accounts and companies while masking Iranian ties.

### Moris Mashali

Iranian-born British solicitor. Co-director with Ansari at multiple entities.

| Entity | Role |
|--------|------|
| Ziba Leisure Ltd | Director |
| Allsco Gravenbruch (Frankfurt hotel) | Managing Director |
| Veritas Reales Investment Ltd | Director |
| A&A Leisure Ltd | Director (dissolved 2024) |

Mashali stated his Ansari connection was as "regulated lawyer providing legal advice" and consultant.

## Contradictions

Iranian state media depicts Supreme Leader's family as living austere, pious lives — revolutionary movement that toppled a monarch in 1979 in name of poor and Islam.

The hidden offshore fortune contradicts this image, especially during:
- Rising poverty
- 2025-2026 protests (thousands killed)
- Anger at **aghazadeh** — pejorative for elite children accused of amassing wealth via political connections

---

## Sanctions

| Jurisdiction | Date | Status |
|--------------|------|--------|
| **US** | 2019 | Sanctioned |
| UK | — | Not directly (but Ansari sanctioned Oct 2025) |
| EU | — | Not sanctioned |

**Note:** Ansari's UK sanctions freeze UK assets. European fire sale possible if EU follows.

---

## SETAD connection

Mojtaba's father heads [[SETAD]] (Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order) — one of Middle East's largest conglomerates. Created through seizure of properties post-revolution. Manages billions in commercial holdings, insurance, energy, telecoms.

Mojtaba's offshore empire is more modest than SETAD. Its purpose unclear — possibly rainy day fund if family needed to leave Iran. UK sanctions on Ansari have complicated this.

## Why he matters

1. **Succession:** Potential next Supreme Leader of Iran
2. **IRGC nexus:** Direct ties to Revolutionary Guard
3. **Sanctions evasion:** Template for how Iranian elites move capital despite restrictions
4. **Hypocrisy:** Revolutionary rhetoric vs offshore billions
5. **Western exposure:** £100M+ in UK alone — policy target
