## What makes LV, LV

**Brand protection:**
- **No sales, ever** — full price only
- **No outlets** — products destroyed, not discounted
- **Controlled distribution** — own stores, no department store "shop-in-shops"
- **Waitlists** — scarcity on popular items

**The monogram:**
- Created 1896 by Georges Vuitton (Louis's son)
- Designed to prevent counterfeiting (ironic given today's fakes)
- Most recognizable luxury pattern globally

**Pricing power:**
- Regular price increases (5-10% annually)
- Customers accept it — brand desirability > price sensitivity
- COVID proved it: raised prices during lockdowns, demand stayed

## Product categories

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Leather goods | Core business, highest margins |
| Ready-to-wear | Growing under Ghesquière/Pharrell |
| Shoes | Sneakers now a major category |
| Accessories | Belts, small leather goods |
| Watches | High-end, limited production |
| Fragrances | Growing segment |

## Competitive position

| vs | LV advantage | LV challenge |
|----|--------------|--------------|
| [[Hermès]] | Scale, accessibility | Lower exclusivity |
| [[Gucci]] | Consistency, heritage | Less "edgy" |
| [[Chanel]] | Diversification | No single iconic product (vs. Chanel No. 5) |

[[Hermès]] is the only brand with comparable pricing power. [[Gucci]] ([[Kering]]) struggles with brand heat cycles.
