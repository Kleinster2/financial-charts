**Drexel Burnham Lambert** — The investment bank that created the junk bond market, financed the 1980s LBO boom, and spawned the modern PE industry. Collapsed Feb 1990 (securities fraud). Graduates include [[Leon Black]], [[Marc Rowan]], [[Josh Harris]] (→ [[Apollo]]), and [[Michael Milken]] (junk bond architect). First Wall Street bankruptcy since the Depression.

## Why Drexel matters

Drexel is the origin point for the alternative asset management industry. Without Drexel:
- No junk bond market → no leveraged buyout era
- No Apollo, no KKR (in its modern form)
- No PE-funded hostile takeovers
- No high-yield credit as an asset class

The firm's DNA lives on in every PE shop that uses credit as a weapon.

## The junk bond revolution

Before Milken, sub-investment-grade bonds were "fallen angels" — formerly IG companies that deteriorated. Milken's insight: junk bonds had acceptable default rates relative to their yield premium, and could be *originated* for companies too small or young for IG ratings.

**What Drexel built:**
- Primary market for new junk bond issuance
- ~50% market share at peak
- $150B market by end of 1980s
- Funded hostile takeovers via "highly confident letters" (promises to arrange financing)
- Made possible: T. Boone Pickens (Gulf [[Oil]]), [[Carl Icahn]] ([[Phillips 66]]), Ted Turner (MGM), KKR (RJR Nabisco)

**Milken's compensation:** >$1B over four years. $550M in a single year (1987). Highest individual compensation in US history at the time.

## The collapse

**Securities fraud:** Boesky's 1986 conviction exposed Drexel's insider trading and market manipulation. Milken indicted 1989.

**$650M settlement** with the government depleted capital. Junk bond market crashed simultaneously — Drexel held large inventory positions.

**Liquidity death spiral:** 1989 losses ($86M going into Q4) → commercial paper downgraded → couldn't roll short-term funding → bankruptcy.

## The diaspora

Drexel alumni founded the modern PE industry:

| Person | Drexel role | Post-Drexel |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [[Leon Black]] | Head of M&A (1984) | Co-founded [[Apollo]] (1990) |
| [[Marc Rowan]] | M&A team (1985–90) | Co-founded [[Apollo]] (1990) |
| [[Josh Harris]] | Analyst (1986–88) | Co-founded [[Apollo]] (1990) |
| [[Michael Milken]] | Head of high-yield (1978–89) | Philanthropy, pardon (2020) |
| Gary Winnick | High-yield salesman | Founded Global Crossing |
| Nelson Peltz | Client/dealmaker | Trian Fund Management |

The Drexel M&A/credit culture — aggressive, contrarian, leveraged — became Apollo's DNA.

## Legacy

**Positive:** Created the high-yield bond market. Democratized capital access for non-IG companies. Proved that credit risk could be systematically priced and traded. Enabled the LBO wave that restructured inefficient conglomerates.

**Negative:** Criminal activity. Excess leverage. Insider trading. Thousands of jobs lost from overleveraged buyouts. $650M in fines.

**Lasting impact:** Every modern PE firm uses Drexel's playbook — credit as both weapon and product. Apollo's evolution from distressed debt to insurance-funded credit ([[Athene]]) is the logical endpoint of Milken's original insight: if you can price credit risk accurately, you can build an empire on it.
