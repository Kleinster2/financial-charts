**Teck Resources** — Canadian miner transforming into a pure-play copper company after selling its steelmaking coal business to [[Glencore]]. QB2 in [[Chile]] is the growth engine. NYSE: TECK.

## Why Teck matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | TECK (NYSE/TSX) |
| Market cap | ~$25B |
| 2025 copper production (actual) | 453,500t |
| 2026 copper guidance | 455–530kt |
| QB2 2025 (actual) | ~190kt |
| HQ | Vancouver |

Teck completed the coal-to-copper transformation and is now merging with [[Anglo American]] to form **Anglo Teck** — a top-5 global copper producer.

## Coal sale to Glencore

Completed 2024. Teck sold 77% of Elk Valley Resources (EVR) to [[Glencore]] for US$7.3B, plus 23% to [[Nippon Steel]] and POSCO for US$1.3B.

**Capital allocation from proceeds:**
- Up to US$2.75B (C$3.5B) for share buybacks
- US$2.75B for debt reduction
- US$250M special dividend

## Key assets

| Asset | Location | Ownership | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| QB2 (Quebrada Blanca) | [[Chile]] | 60% | Growth asset, 27-year mine life |
| Highland Valley Copper | BC, [[Canada]] | 100% | Largest in Canada |
| Antamina | Peru | 22.5% | JV with [[BHP]], [[Glencore]], Mitsubishi |
| Carmen de Andacollo | [[Chile]] | 90% | SX-EW operation |
| Trail | BC, [[Canada]] | 100% | Zinc/lead smelter (one of world's largest) |

## QB2 — the growth story (and the headache)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Initial 2025 guidance | 230–270kt Cu |
| Q2 2025 revision | 210–230kt |
| Q3 2025 revision | 170–190kt |
| Issue | Tailings Management Facility (TMF) constraints |
| 2026 outlook | Still TMF-constrained |
| 2027+ | TMF no longer expected to constrain throughput |
| Mine life | 27 years |
| Cash costs (2025) | US$2.65–3.00/lb (above original guidance) |

QB2 was supposed to double Teck's copper production. It's doing that — just more slowly than planned. TMF mechanical construction has caused repeated downtime.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (Q1 2025) | $2.29B (+41% YoY) |
| EPS (Q1 2025) | $0.60 (vs -$0.01 prior year) |
| Cash | $6.2B (Q1 2025), $4.8B (Q2 2025) |
| Long-term debt | $4.1B (Q1 2025) |
| Debt reduction since 2024 | $2B |
| Liquidity (Q2 2025) | $8.9B |
| Share buybacks (Q1 2025) | $380M |

**Balance sheet is fortress-like** post coal sale. The question is execution at QB2.

## Growth pipeline

| Project | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| QB2 ramp-up | Ongoing, TMF-constrained | Double copper output |
| Highland Valley MLE | $2.1–2.4B, 2025–2028 | Extends mine life to 2046 |
| San Nicolás | JV with Agnico Eagle | Copper-zinc development |

Sustaining capex 2025: US$940M–1,010M. Growth capex: US$1,040–1,170M.

## Anglo American merger

Announced September 2025. Merger of equals to form **Anglo Teck**, headquartered in Vancouver.

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Combined copper production | 1.2Mt (growing to ~1.35Mt by 2027) |
| Copper revenue exposure | >70% of combined entity |
| Pre-tax synergies | US$800M annually |
| Collahuasi-QB EBITDA uplift | US$1.4B average annual (2030–2049) |
| Shareholder approval | Both companies, Dec 2025 |
| Canada ICA approval | Received Dec 2025 |
| Remaining approvals | Multiple global jurisdictions, 2026 |
| Expected close | Late 2026 or early 2027 |

The combination of [[Anglo American]]'s Collahuasi mine (adjacent to QB2 in [[Chile]]) with Teck's Quebrada Blanca would create one of the world's largest copper complexes. Share buyback paused at $2.25B of $3.25B program pending merger.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Anglo American merger creates top-5 global copper producer
- $800M annual synergies + $1.4B Collahuasi-QB EBITDA uplift
- QB2 = 27-year mine life, doubles production
- Fortress balance sheet ($4.8B cash)
- Highland Valley MLE extends key asset to 2046
- PEG ratio of 0.61 (vs FCX 0.95, SCCO 1.49)
- [[Copper]] structural deficit benefits

**Bear:**
- QB2 execution risk — repeated guidance cuts from TMF issues
- TMF issues not resolved until 2027
- Anglo American merger still needs global regulatory clearance
- Red Dog zinc mine declining (555kt → 290kt by 2028, closure ~2032)
- [[Chile]] political/regulatory risk
- Capital-intensive growth ($2.1–2.4B HVC MLE, $1.5–1.8B Zafranal)
- Merger dilution risk
