**YMTC (Yangtze Memory Technologies Co.)** — China's leading NAND flash manufacturer, under US export restrictions.

## Core position

China's national champion for memory independence. State-backed effort to break [[SK Hynix]]/[[Samsung]]/[[Micron]] oligopoly in NAND.

---

## Technology status

| Metric | YMTC | Industry leaders |
|--------|------|------------------|
| NAND layers | 232L (achieved) | 300L+ (SK Hynix, Samsung) |
| Production scale | Limited | Mass production |
| Export restrictions | Severe (US Entity List) | None |

**Key challenge:** Equipment access blocked by US export controls. Cannot buy EUV, advanced deposition/etch tools from [[ASML]], [[Lam Research]], [[Applied Materials]], [[KLA]].

---

## Export control impact

**Entity List (Oct 2022):**
- Cut off from US equipment suppliers
- Cannot service existing tools
- Forced to develop domestic alternatives

**Workarounds:**
- Stockpiled equipment pre-ban
- Domestic tool development (lagging)
- Some tools via third countries (enforcement tightening)

---

## Strategic significance

**For China:**
- Memory is strategic commodity (data centers, AI, phones)
- Dependency on Korea/US unacceptable
- Willing to subsidize indefinitely

**For memory incumbents:**
- YMTC was gaining share pre-ban (competitive 128L/232L)
- Export controls bought time
- But China won't stop trying

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Samsung]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[SK Hynix]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[Micron]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[CXMT]] (China DRAM) | Different market (DRAM vs NAND) |

---

## Key uncertainties

- How long can they maintain existing equipment?
- Domestic tool progress (SMEE, NAURA, [[AMEC]])
- Will China prioritize DRAM ([[CXMT]]) over NAND?
- Enforcement of third-country equipment flows

---

## For theses

- [[Export controls]] — primary target alongside [[Huawei]]
- [[Long memory]] — YMTC constraints support pricing
- [[China]] — national champion, unlimited state backing

---

## IPO consideration (Jan 2026)

**Mainland China IPO:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | **$40B+** |
| Exchange | Mainland China (TBD) |
| Status | Considering |

Part of broader wave of Chinese chip IPOs seeking capital for self-reliance push.

## Pentagon blacklist removal (Feb 2026)

YMTC and [[ChangXin Memory|CXMT]] removed from the US Pentagon's Chinese Military Companies blacklist (Feb 2026). Potentially makes it easier for YMTC to acquire knowhow, and for desperate consumer buyers to source NAND from Chinese manufacturers during the [[Memory squeeze thesis|AI-driven memory squeeze]]. May accelerate YMTC's ability to prove competitiveness ahead of any future cycle turn.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private (state-backed) |
| Revenue (est.) | $1-2B |
| NAND capacity | ~100K wafers/month |
| Layers | 232L achieved |
| Backing | Tsinghua Unigroup, national funds |
| Listed | No (IPO mulled at $40B+) |

**Constrained growth:** Entity List status limits expansion and equipment access.
