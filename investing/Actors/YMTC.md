**YMTC (Yangtze Memory Technologies Co.)** — China's leading NAND flash manufacturer, under US export restrictions.

## Core position

China's national champion for memory independence. State-backed effort to break [[SK Hynix]]/[[Samsung]]/[[Micron]] oligopoly in NAND.

---

## Technology status

| Metric | YMTC | Industry leaders |
|--------|------|------------------|
| NAND layers | 232L (achieved) | 300L+ (SK Hynix, Samsung) |
| Production scale | Limited | Mass production |
| Export restrictions | Severe (US Entity List) | None |

**Key challenge:** Equipment access blocked by US export controls. Cannot buy EUV, advanced deposition/etch tools from [[ASML]], [[Lam Research]], [[Applied Materials]], [[KLA]].

---

## Export control impact

**Entity List (Oct 2022):**
- Cut off from US equipment suppliers
- Cannot service existing tools
- Forced to develop domestic alternatives

**Workarounds:**
- Stockpiled equipment pre-ban
- Domestic tool development (lagging)
- Some tools via third countries (enforcement tightening)

---

## Strategic significance

**For China:**
- Memory is strategic commodity (data centers, AI, phones)
- Dependency on Korea/US unacceptable
- Willing to subsidize indefinitely

**For memory incumbents:**
- YMTC was gaining share pre-ban (competitive 128L/232L)
- Export controls bought time
- But China won't stop trying

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Samsung]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[SK Hynix]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[Micron]] | 2+ generations behind |
| [[CXMT]] (China DRAM) | Different market (DRAM vs NAND) |

---

## Key uncertainties

- How long can they maintain existing equipment?
- Domestic tool progress (SMEE, NAURA, AMEC)
- Will China prioritize DRAM ([[CXMT]]) over NAND?
- Enforcement of third-country equipment flows

---

## For theses

- [[Export controls]] — primary target alongside [[Huawei]]
- [[Long memory]] — YMTC constraints support pricing
- [[China]] — national champion, unlimited state backing
