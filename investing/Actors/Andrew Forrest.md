## Career

Forrest took control of Allied Mining and Processing (a struggling gold miner) in 2003 and redirected it to Pilbara [[Iron ore|iron ore]], renaming it Fortescue Metals Group. First shipment to [[China]] by May 2008. Under his leadership, [[Fortescue]] grew to 198 Mt/year shipments and paid A$42B in cumulative dividends.

Drove [[Fortescue]]'s [[Green hydrogen|green hydrogen]] pivot — originally targeting 15 Mt/year of green hydrogen by 2030 and "real zero" emissions by 2030. This was dramatically scaled back in 2024-2025 after two rounds of ~700 layoffs each and ~$150M in project writedowns.

In June 2023, donated A$5B in FMG shares to [[Minderoo Foundation]] — one of [[Australia]]'s largest philanthropic gifts.
