**Palantir** — AI applications platform. Public (PLTR). 63% growth, 51% operating margin. Government + commercial.

Rare profitable AI applications company at scale with ~$180B+ market cap, 63% YoY revenue growth, and 51% operating margins across government and commercial segments. Q4 2025 beat estimates ($0.25 EPS vs $0.21 expected, stock +11%) and guided FY2026 revenue to $7.19B — 61% growth, far above Street's $6.27B. Platform stack spans Gotham (government intelligence), Foundry (commercial analytics), and AIP (AI Platform). The bull case: deepest government AI relationships in the industry, commercial acceleration via AIP, and rare combination of hypergrowth + profitability + strong FCF. The bear case: 142x expected earnings (3rd highest in S&P 500), stock had already fallen 29% from November peak before the beat, and concentration in US government contracts creates binary risk around budget cycles.

## Evolution

The story of Palantir is the story of a company that was too weird for Silicon Valley and too useful for Washington — a 20-year money-losing experiment in intelligence software that the AI revolution transformed into a $250B juggernaut overnight.

- 2003-2004: [[Peter Thiel]] founds Palantir in May 2003, naming it after the "seeing stone" in Lord of the Rings (the office locations get Tolkien names too — The Shire in Palo Alto, Rivendell in McLean, Minas Tirith in DC). The founding thesis comes from PayPal: Thiel's team had built a fraud detection system called "Igor" (named after a persistent Russian abuser) that fused human judgment with pattern-matching algorithms. The FBI noticed and asked for something similar. Thiel bankrolls a prototype built by PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings and Stanford students [[Joe Lonsdale]] and Stephen Cohen, then hires his Stanford Law School classmate Alex Karp — a philosophy PhD with no tech background — as CEO. Karp is an eccentric choice: he practices Qi Gong, grew up between Philadelphia and Frankfurt, and describes Palantir's approach as "classic German" influenced by Hegelian dialectics. The choice is deliberate — Thiel wants someone who can navigate Washington, not someone who thinks like an engineer

- 2004-2008: Silicon Valley wants nothing to do with them. Sequoia's Michael Moritz doodles through the entire pitch meeting. Kleiner Perkins lectures the founders about their "inevitable failure." The government is unpopular in the Valley and nobody wants to fund enterprise software for intelligence agencies. Thiel and his venture fund bankroll the initial $30M largely alone. But In-Q-Tel — the CIA's venture capital arm — invests $2M and, more importantly, introduces Palantir to actual intelligence analysts. For two years, the company continuously revises its technology based on direct feedback from CIA and FBI users. The product that emerges — Gotham — can connect siloed databases across agencies, something the intelligence community had been unable to do since 9/11 exposed the failure. Series A ($7.5M, Oakhouse Partners, June 2006) and Series B ($10.5M, Reed Elsevier, November 2006) follow. Palantir never gives investors board seats — not even In-Q-Tel. Founder control from day one

- 2010-2013: The government validates Palantir publicly. Vice President Biden holds a press conference at the White House in June 2010 crediting Palantir with helping detect fraud in the stimulus spending program. Revenue hits ~$250M by 2011. The company becomes embedded across the intelligence community, the military, and law enforcement. But the commercial side is a black hole — enterprises don't know what to do with intelligence-grade software, and Palantir's sales model (deploy forward-deployed engineers for months to integrate the platform) is absurdly expensive per customer. Palantir raises at increasingly inflated valuations through private rounds — $9B in 2014, $20B in 2015 — but bleeds cash. The bull case is that it's building something nobody else can; the bear case is that it's a consulting firm disguised as a software company

- 2014-2019: The long purgatory. Revenue grows from ~$600M (2018) to ~$743M (2019) — respectable but nowhere near the growth rate a $20B private valuation demands. The company is unprofitable every single year. Stock-based compensation is enormous. The forward-deployed engineer model doesn't scale. Government contracts grow steadily but commercial traction remains elusive — Palantir's products are powerful but require months of bespoke integration, making the land-and-expand model painfully slow. Meanwhile, controversy builds: ICE contracts for immigration enforcement, predictive policing partnerships that draw ACLU criticism, and Thiel's increasingly polarizing political profile. By 2019, Palantir has been private for 16 years — one of the longest pre-IPO stretches in tech history. Employees are restless, early investors want liquidity, and the company is still losing money

- 2020 (IPO into a storm): Direct listing on NYSE on September 30, 2020, at a $21B reference valuation. The stock opens at $10 and immediately becomes a meme — retail investors love the Tolkien branding, the CIA origin story, and the contrarian positioning. Revenue is $1.1B, growing 47% YoY, powered by COVID-era government contracts (data analytics for pandemic response, supply chain tracking). But the company loses $1.2B on $1.1B in revenue — stock-based comp alone exceeds revenue. The stock spikes to $39 in January 2021 during the Reddit/meme stock frenzy, then begins a brutal 18-month decline

- 2021-2022 (the desert): Stock crashes from $39 (Jan 2021) to $6.44 (Dec 2022) — an 83% decline. Revenue grows from $1.54B to $1.91B but the company remains unprofitable. Growth decelerates to 24% (2022), the slowest in its public history. Government revenue is lumpy and dependent on contract renewals. Commercial growth is anemic. The narrative is that Palantir is a niche government contractor with an unsustainable cost structure, not a platform company. In November 2022, Palantir transfers from NYSE to Nasdaq — a prerequisite for Nasdaq-100 inclusion. At $6, with a $15B market cap, it looks like a busted IPO that will never justify its hype

- 2023 (AIP changes everything): In April 2023, Palantir launches AIP — the Artificial Intelligence Platform — and the entire story changes. The key insight: Palantir doesn't build its own LLM. Instead, it builds the orchestration layer that lets enterprises deploy any LLM (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) against their own proprietary data while maintaining security and governance controls. This is precisely what Gotham did for intelligence agencies — connect siloed data sources and make them queryable — but now with LLMs as the interface. AIP solves the commercial scaling problem that plagued Palantir for 20 years: instead of deploying forward-deployed engineers for months, enterprises can run "bootcamps" (2-5 day intensive workshops) and get to production in weeks. Revenue reaccelerates to 17% growth. More importantly, Q1 2023 marks Palantir's first-ever GAAP-profitable quarter — $31M net income. After 20 years of losses. Stock triples from $6 to $17 by year-end

- 2024 (S&P 500 and escape velocity): Revenue hits $2.87B (+29%). Operating margins expand to 11%. But the real story is AIP-driven commercial acceleration — commercial revenue grows faster than government for the first time. The bootcamp model works: customers go from zero to production AI in days, then expand. S&P 500 inclusion on September 23, 2024, triggers a 14% single-day pop and opens the floodgates for index fund buying. Stock goes from $17 to $80+ by year-end — a 12x from the December 2022 low. Dan Ives of [[Wedbush]] calls Karp "the Messi of AI" and becomes Palantir's most vocal bull

- 2025 (the $200B company): Revenue reaches $4.48B (+56%). Operating margins hit 51% — among the highest in enterprise software. Stock peaks at $207 in November. Market cap crosses $250B. Palantir joins the S&P 100 and Nasdaq-100. Q4 revenue grows 70% YoY to $1.41B. Government revenue surges on Pentagon AI contracts, including a partnership with [[Anthropic]] to deploy Claude on classified networks. Commercial revenue accelerates on AIP adoption. The company that couldn't convince Sequoia to invest in 2004 is now worth more than most of Sequoia's portfolio combined. FY2026 guidance: $7.19B revenue (+61%), far above Street's $6.27B

- 2026 (current): Stock pulled back from $207 to ~$136 — a 34% decline that still leaves it up 2,000%+ from the $6 low. Trades at 142x expected earnings (3rd highest in S&P 500). The valuation debate is the investment debate: is this a once-in-a-generation platform company (like Salesforce in 2005) or a momentum stock trading on AI hype? At $180B+ market cap on $4.5B revenue, the market is pricing Palantir as the enterprise AI operating system. The bull case has never been stronger — 51% margins, 56% growth, deepest government AI moat in the industry, commercial acceleration. The bear case is pure math: 142x earnings leaves zero margin for error

The arc: CIA-backed counterterrorism startup → 16 years of Silicon Valley rejection → 20 years of losses → meme stock IPO → 83% stock crash → AIP launch transforms the business overnight → $250B AI juggernaut. The irony: the thing that made Palantir unpopular in the Valley (building for government, not consumers) turned out to be the ultimate moat when AI became the most important technology on earth.
