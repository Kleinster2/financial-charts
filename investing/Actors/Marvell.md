**Marvell Technology (MRVL)** — fabless chip designer, key ASIC partner for [[Amazon]] and others.

---

## Role in AI supply chain

Custom silicon design for hyperscalers — competes with [[Broadcom]]:

```
Hyperscaler (spec) → Marvell (design) → TSMC (fab) → Hyperscaler (consume)
```

Specializes in:
- Custom AI accelerators (ASICs)
- Networking silicon
- Storage controllers

## Key customers

| Customer | Product | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **[[Amazon]]** | Trainium, Inferentia | Primary ASIC partner |
| [[Microsoft]] | Maia 300 (Griffin) | Expanding relationship |
| Data center | Networking | Switching, NICs |

See [[Hyperscaler chip roadmap]] for full customer breakdown.

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| [[Broadcom]] | Smaller, but strong Amazon relationship |
| [[MediaTek]] | Different focus (MediaTek = mobile/Google) |
| In-house teams | Partner, not competitor |

**Strength**: Deep Amazon relationship, networking expertise
**Weakness**: Smaller scale than Broadcom, less diversified customer base

---

## Amazon dependency

Marvell's AI story is largely Amazon:
- Trainium v2, v3, v4 designs
- Inferentia custom silicon
- Long-term partnership

Risk: Amazon concentration. Opportunity: Amazon scaling massively.

---

## For theses

- [[Long Broadcom]] — Marvell is the #2 ASIC player, validates market
- [[Hyperscaler chip roadmap]] — key Amazon enabler
- [[Long TSMC]] — Marvell chips go to TSMC
