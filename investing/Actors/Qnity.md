## Why Qnity matters

The largest US-based semiconductor materials company, now a pure-play:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | Q (NYSE) |
| Spin-off date | November 1, 2025 |
| 2024 revenue | $5.93B (as DuPont Electronics) |
| 2024 EBITDA | $1.72B (29% margin) |
| Employees | 10,000+ |
| Manufacturing sites | 39 worldwide |
| TAM | >$30B |

---

## Business overview

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semiconductor Technologies** | [[Photoresists]], CMP slurries, etch materials |
| **Interconnect Solutions** | [[Advanced packaging]], laminates |

**~2/3 of revenue tied to semiconductors** — exposure to AI, HPC, advanced nodes.

---

## Photoresist business

| Product | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **EUV photoresists** | Arizona facility for High-NA EUV |
| **ArF/KrF** | Mature but stable |
| **Thick-film resists** | Strong position (packaging) |
| **Bio-based solvents** | New sustainable line (July 2025) |

**Sasakami expansion ([[Japan]]):**
- East Star Building opened October 2024
- Nearly doubled photoresist capacity
- Serves Asian fabs

**Arizona facility:**
- New manufacturing site
- Supports High-NA EUV ramp
- 300mm wafer line capacity

## 2024-2025 performance (as DuPont E&I)

| Metric | 2024 | YoY |
|--------|------|-----|
| Net sales | $5.93B | +11% |
| Operating EBITDA | $1.72B | +17% |
| EBITDA margin | 29.0% | +150bps |
| Semiconductor sales | — | +20%+ |

**Q4 2024:** $1.51B revenue, 30.3% EBITDA margin.

## Competitive position

| Company | Share | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private, [[Japan]] |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | [[Japan]] |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | [[Japan]] |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | [[Japan]] |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | [[Japan]] |
| **Qnity** | ~7% | **US, pure-play** |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | [[Germany]] |

**Qnity differentiation:** Only major US-headquartered pure-play in semiconductor materials. Supply chain diversification value.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Pure-play post-spin (no DuPont conglomerate discount)
- US-based supply chain diversification value
- 29%+ EBITDA margins
- AI/semiconductor structural demand growth
- S&P 500 inclusion day one
- High-NA EUV positioning (Arizona)
- [[Advanced packaging]] exposure (chiplets, [[HBM]])

**Bear:**
- Smaller than Japanese leaders
- Currency headwinds (global operations)
- Cyclical semiconductor demand
- Competition from entrenched Japanese suppliers
- Post-spin execution risk

---

## DuPont residual

After the spin, DuPont (DD) retained:
- Water & Protection segment
- Industrial Solutions
- Corporate overhead

Qnity took the high-growth electronics business.

---

## Sustainability angle

**July 2025:** Launched bio-based solvent photoresists
- 40% carbon footprint reduction
- No performance compromise
- Targets automotive electronics initially

---

## Price action

![[qnity-vs-smh.png]]
*[[Semiconductors|SMH]]*

**Since spin-off (Nov 2025):** Q +3% vs [[SMH]] +24%

Classic spin-off dynamics:
- Forced selling from DuPont holders who didn't want materials exposure
- Index fund rebalancing (added to S&P 500 day one)
- Small-cap effect (Q ~$6B vs DD ~$30B)
- Potential opportunity if undervaluation persists

| Date | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Nov 1, 2025 | ~$95 | Spin-off |
| Nov 15, 2025 | ~$75 | Post-spin low (-21%) |
| Jan 16, 2026 | ~$97 | Recovery |
