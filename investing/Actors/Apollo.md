## Financials

*Revenue stepped up sharply after Athene merger consolidation (2022). Net income turned consistently positive from 2021.*

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Net Income ($B) | EBITDA ($B) |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 2015 | 1.0 | 0.1 | 0.5 |
| 2016 | 2.1 | 0.4 | 1.1 |
| 2017 | 2.8 | 0.6 | 1.8 |
| 2018 | 1.1 | -0.03 | 0.2 |
| 2019 | 2.9 | 0.8 | 1.6 |
| 2020 | 2.4 | 0.2 | 1.0 |
| 2021 | 6.0 | 1.8 | 5.8 |
| 2022 | 11.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 |
| 2023 | 32.6 | 5.1 | 6.7 |
| 2024 | 26.1 | 4.4 | 8.9 |
| 2025 | 30.3 | 4.5 | 10.5 |

Revenue volatility pre-2022 reflects mark-to-market swings on investment gains/losses (typical for alt managers). 2022+ step-change from Athene consolidation — insurance premiums now flow through revenue. EBITDA trajectory shows underlying earnings power growing steadily.

## Evolution

- 1977–1990 — [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]]: All three founders came from [[Michael Milken]]'s shop. [[Leon Black]] (13 years, Head of M&A), [[Marc Rowan]] (Wharton '85, joined M&A directly), [[Josh Harris]] (analyst). Core insight from Drexel: credit markets are mispriced far more often than equity markets. Drexel collapsed Feb 1990 after Milken's guilty plea.
- 1990 — Founding: Black, Rowan, and Harris launched Apollo Advisors within six months of Drexel's bankruptcy. First fund raised ~$400M. Strategy: distressed debt — buying bonds of troubled companies at deep discounts, restructuring or converting to equity.
- 1991 — Executive Life Insurance: Apollo's first blockbuster. Acquired the seized insurer's high-yield bond portfolio at distressed prices. When junk bonds recovered, returns were enormous. Cemented Apollo's reputation as the premier distressed-debt shop (though it also drew regulatory scrutiny from California AG).
- 2006–2008 — Mega-LBO era: Scaled into leveraged buyouts during the pre-crisis boom. [[Caesars Entertainment]] ($27.8B with [[TPG]], Dec 2006, closed Jan 2008), ADT, Berry Plastics, Norwegian Cruise Line. AUM hit $40.3B by end of 2007, 53% CAGR from 2004.
- 2008–2009 — LyondellBasell (greatest trade): Wagered ~$2B on distressed debt of bankrupt LyondellBasell (bought as low as 20 cents on the dollar). Converted to 25% equity, cut $1B/year in fixed costs. U.S. fracking boom supercharged petrochemical margins. Extracted ~$9B total — roughly 4x invested capital. One of the most profitable single investments in PE history.
- 2009 — [[Athene]] created: Founded Athene Holding as a captive insurance/annuity platform to invest float in Apollo-originated credit. Co-founded by [[Jim Belardi]]. This was the structural innovation that enabled the credit pivot — [[Permanent capital]] without constant fundraising.
- 2011 — IPO: Listed on NYSE at $19/share, raised ~$565M. Lead underwriters: Goldman, JPM, BofA.
- 2015 — Caesars bankruptcy: [[Caesars Entertainment]] Operating Co. filed Chapter 11 under $18B of debt. Apollo and TPG's combined stake diluted from 60% to ~16% in the 2017 emergence. Apollo's most visible loss — cautionary tale about peak-cycle mega-LBOs.
- 2016 — Credit becomes dominant: By 2015, credit was 71% of AUM ($121B of $170B total). The pivot from traditional PE to credit-heavy was Apollo's defining strategic decision — more stable earnings, vastly larger addressable market ($40T investment-grade private credit), and differentiation from [[KKR]], [[Blackstone]], [[Carlyle]].
- Sep 2019 — C-corp conversion: Converted from publicly traded partnership to C-corporation after 2017 tax reform dropped corporate rate to 21%. Opened Apollo to index fund inclusion and broader institutional ownership.
- Mar 2021 — Leon Black out: Dechert review revealed Black paid [[Jeffrey Epstein]] $158M (2012–2017) for advisory services. Black stepped down as CEO and chairman effective immediately. [[Marc Rowan]] became CEO; [[Jay Clayton]] (former SEC chair) became non-executive chairman.
- Jan 2022 — [[Athene]] merger completed: Acquired remaining Athene shares for ~$11B all-stock. Athene became wholly owned subsidiary. Retirement Services SRE now exceeds fee-related earnings ($3.4B vs $2.5B in 2025).
- 2022 — Josh Harris departs: Passed over for CEO in favor of Rowan. Left Apollo, founded [[26North]] (multi-asset alternatives). Acquired Washington Commanders for $6B (2023 record for U.S. sports franchise).
- Apr 2025 — Jay Clayton resigns: Left board to become Interim U.S. Attorney, SDNY. Rowan took dual CEO/Chairman role; [[Gary Cohn]] became Lead Independent Director.
- 2025 — Approaching $1T: AUM reached $938B (Dec 2025, +25% YoY). Record origination exceeded $300B. Rowan targeting $1.5T AUM by 2029 and doubling annual credit origination to $200–250B. Apollo now has ~4,000 professionals across 16 origination platforms.

## Japan strategy (Feb 2026)

Apollo convened its 200 partners in Tokyo (Feb 2026) to see firsthand the investment opportunity in [[Japan]]. CEO [[Marc Rowan]]: "There's a new swagger" in Japan — generational change across corporate governance, interest rates, and government policy. Japan is "the first of the Western democracies to face real aging, retirement, and high levels of government debt."

**Three pillars in Japan:**

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Retirement services | Long-standing reinsurance player in Japan. Creating products for Japanese retirees facing 3% inflation for first time |
| Capital to industry | Private credit for corporates (Sony, SMBC, others). Long-dated, investment-grade — filling gap between bank debt and equity |
| Buyouts | Active buyout business. [[Panasonic Automotive]] carveout (2024) is flagship deal |

**Japan team:** [[Eiji Ueda]] (Head of Asia Pacific, ex-[[Goldman Sachs]]/[[GPIF]]), Tanaka-san (Japan chairman). Rowan: "The intellectual capital we've put here is second to none."

**The private credit thesis:** Japan's financial system is primarily bank debt and equity. Corporate bond market is only ¥60T outstanding — small for a $4.2T economy. As capital needs grow (manufacturing, energy, AI/data, infrastructure), corporates need a third option: long-dated, complex financing that banks can't efficiently provide. Apollo positions as supplement to banks, not competitor. Working with Japanese banks as partners (providing capital, not advisory/hedging/M&A services).

**Key deals:**
- [[Sony]] — music catalog financing (low-risk, long-dated private credit for music assets)
- [[SMBC]] — partnership
- [[Panasonic Automotive]] — majority stake carveout from [[Panasonic]] (2024). Panasonic Holdings stock +70% since
- Buy now, pay later financing for Japanese companies

**Approach:** "Education, not resistance" — Japanese institutions and corporates are rational actors responding to new macro environment. Rowan sees an inflection point in the rate of change, spurred by higher inflation.

**Wealth market:** Japanese household savings (¥2,000T, ~$13T+) shifting from 55% cash to productive assets. Apollo targeting safe yield and defensive equity products for retail/HNW investors.

## Altice USA litigation

[[Altice]] (now Optimum Communications) sued Apollo, [[Ares Management]], and [[BlackRock]] in late 2025, alleging an "illegal cartel" among lenders holding majority of its $26B debt. Lawsuit claims cooperation agreement barred one-on-one negotiations unless two-thirds of creditors consented.

Part of [[Patrick Drahi]]'s aggressive creditor management strategy as his telecom empire restructures.
