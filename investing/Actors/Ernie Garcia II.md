## Gotham allegations (Jan 2026)

[[Gotham City Research]] alleges Garcia II's entities prop up Carvana:
- DriveTime buys CVNA loans at inflated prices
- Bridgecrest services at below-market fees
- GoFi acts as pass-through entity
- All share same auditor (Grant Thornton)

Gotham obtained DriveTime and GoFi financials via FOIA (bond filings).

## Governance concern

Father-son control structure with intertwined entities:
- Son runs public company (CVNA)
- Father owns private entities that transact with CVNA
- Related-party transactions lack arm's-length scrutiny
- Same auditor across all entities
