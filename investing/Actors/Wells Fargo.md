| Metric | Guidance | Consensus |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| NII | ~$50B | $50.2B |

**Stock reaction:** -4.8% to $89 (revenue miss weighed on sentiment).

**CEO Charlie Scharf:** "We have built a strong foundation and have made great progress in improving growth and returns, though we have operated with significant constraints."

**Context:** First full year freed from Fed asset cap — struggled to shift conversation away from expense jump (severance).

## Investment case

- Mortgage business weak
- [[Credit card rate cap]] risk
- Competition in core markets
