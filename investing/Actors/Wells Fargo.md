## Scandal recovery

**2016 fake accounts scandal:**
- Unauthorized account openings
- $3B+ in fines
- Fed asset cap (still in place)
- Multi-year remediation

**[[Charlie Scharf]] (CEO since 2019):**
- Efficiency improvements
- Risk management overhaul
- Expense reduction
- Working to lift asset cap

## Asset cap — REMOVED (June 2025)

**Fed restriction lifted:**

|------|-------|
| 2018 | Asset cap imposed (~$1.95T) |
| 2018-2025 | Multi-year remediation |
| **June 2025** | **Asset cap removed** |
| Q4 2025 | Assets surpass $2T for first time |

**Catalyst realized:** This was the bull case for years. Now playing out.

## Q4 2025 Earnings (Jan 14, 2026)

| Metric | Actual | Estimate | Result |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **EPS** | $1.62 | $1.66 | Miss |
| **Adj. EPS** | $1.76 | $1.66 | Beat |
| **Revenue** | $21.29B | $21.65B | Miss |
| **NII** | $12.33B | $12.46B | Miss |

### Why the gap?

| Item | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Severance charges | $612M (efficiency push continuing) |
| Mortgage profits | Declined |

### Year-over-year

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| EPS | $1.62 | $1.43 | +13.3% |
| Revenue | $21.29B | $20.38B | +4.5% |
| NII | $12.33B | — | +4% |

### 2026 Guidance

| Metric | Guidance | Consensus |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| NII | ~$50B | $50.2B |

**Stock reaction:** -4.8% to $89 (revenue miss weighed on sentiment).

**CEO [[Charlie Scharf]]:** "We have built a strong foundation and have made great progress in improving growth and returns, though we have operated with significant constraints."

**Context:** First full year freed from Fed asset cap — struggled to shift conversation away from expense jump (severance).

## AI strategy (2025-2026)

**Most aggressive headcount cuts among US big 4 banks — but catching up, not leading.**

### Why WFC is cutting hardest

"Most aggressive" doesn't mean most efficient. WFC is *behind* on productivity:

| Bank | Employees | Net Income | NI/Employee |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| JPMorgan | 317k | ~$60B | **$189k** |
| Bank of America | 213k | ~$27B | $127k |
| **Wells Fargo** | 210k | ~$20B | **$95k** |
| Citigroup | 229k | ~$13B | $57k |

JPM generates **2x more profit per employee** than WFC. The AI-for-cost-cutting strategy is about catching up to peers, not extending a lead.

The real efficiency benchmark: Singapore banks (DBS, OCBC) run 38-43% cost/income ratios vs WFC's 62%. See [[AI in banking]].

### Headcount transformation

| Date | Employees | Change |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2019 (Scharf joins) | 275,000 | — |
| Sept 2025 | 210,000 | **-65,000 (-24%)** |
| 2026+ | Further cuts expected | "Less people next year" |

**Now smallest of big 4 by headcount** — down from largest five years ago.

### Key hire: Faraz Shafiq (Jan 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Previous | [[Amazon Web Services\|AWS]] |
| Start date | Feb 9, 2026 |
| Reports to | [[Saul Van Beurden]] (head of AI + consumer) |
| Focus | Companywide AI needs, [[agentic AI]], product consolidation |

**Why regulated industry experience matters:** "If you never work for a regulated company, it's really a cold shower to come to a bank. It will not be a cold shower because he understands what it means to be regulated." — Van Beurden

Previous: telecom, health-tech (both highly regulated).

### Scharf on AI (Dec 2025)

- "AI is extremely significant, both in terms of the efficiencies it can drive and what it is going to potentially do to headcount"
- "Gen AI tools within our engineering workforce were 30% to 35% more efficient in writing code today"
- "We've not reduced coders, but getting a lot more done — that's real efficiency"
- Bank "not yet as efficient as it would be with AI"
- AI described as "positive reality"

### 2026 plan

- Gradual AI rollout through 2026+
- More AI training for employees
- Goal: offload mundane tasks, expand business without hiring
- If jobs "completely go away through AI," train workforce with AI skills for redeployment

### Q4 2025 signal

$612M severance charges — efficiency push continuing even post-asset-cap removal.

See [[AI in banking]] for industry context.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Asset cap removed (June 2025) — catalyst realized
- Efficiency gains continuing (severance = more cuts coming)
- AI-driven productivity upside (30-35% coding efficiency already)
- Rate sensitivity
- Now can grow assets above $2T

**Bear:**
- Revenue miss suggests execution challenges
- NII guidance slightly below consensus
- Mortgage business weak
- [[Credit card rate cap]] risk
- Competition in core markets
- Heavy restructuring may distract from growth
