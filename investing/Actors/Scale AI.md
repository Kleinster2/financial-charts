---

## Post-Meta structure

**Split leadership:**
- Alexandr Wang → Meta (superintelligence)
- Jason Droege → Scale (interim CEO)
- Meta owns 49%, influences direction

Effectively a Meta subsidiary now.

---

## Customer concentration risk (2026)

Meta's 49% ownership has created competitive conflicts:
- Google, OpenAI, xAI have reduced or paused engagements
- Data confidentiality concerns (competitor owns the platform)
- Scale must prove independence despite Meta's influence

---

## Robotics expansion (Sep 2025)

Expanded into robotics data collection — hiring hundreds of contractors globally to record point-of-view demonstrations for startups training AI-powered robots. Diversification beyond text/image labeling.

---

## Business evolution

By 2026, Scale has evolved beyond data labeling into a full-stack "AI Readiness" partner:
- 400+ enterprise clients worldwide
- Donovan platform deployed on classified networks (SIPRNet, JWICS)
- Military commanders query real-time battlefield data via natural language
- Spans tech giants, automotive, government, and startups

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Data labeling essential for AI training
- Meta backing = massive resources and scale
- $249M DoD + $99M Army contracts = government moat
- $2B revenue trajectory, 130% growth
- Robotics expansion opens new TAM
- Donovan = sticky defense platform

**Bear:**
- Meta controls destiny (49% ownership)
- Wang departed (founder risk)
- Customer concentration risk (Google, OpenAI reducing engagement)
- Labeling may commoditize long-term
- IPO timeline uncertain (Meta liquidity reduced pressure)
