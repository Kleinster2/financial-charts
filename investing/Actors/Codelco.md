**Codelco** — World's largest copper producer. Chilean state-owned. Sets market tone. Not investable but crucial context.

---

## Why Codelco matters

Codelco is the elephant in the room:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Chilean state-owned |
| Production | ~1.5M tons/year |
| Global share | ~10% of world copper |
| Reserves | Largest in world |
| Role | Price setter, supply anchor |

**The biggest producer sets the tone** for the entire copper market.

## Key assets

| Asset | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Chuquicamata | World's largest open-pit (now underground) |
| El Teniente | World's largest underground |
| Radomiro Tomic | Major open-pit |
| Andina | High-altitude |
| Gabriela Mistral | Heap leach |

All in Chile — the Saudi Arabia of copper.

## The production problem

Codelco is struggling:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Aging mines | Grades declining |
| Underinvestment | Capex deferred for decades |
| Political pressure | Profits to government |
| Transition costs | Open-pit to underground |
| Cost inflation | Labor, energy, inputs |

**Production has fallen** from peak ~1.8M to ~1.5M tons.

---

## Why this matters for copper prices

| Dynamic | Price impact |
|---------|--------------|
| Codelco struggles | Less supply |
| World needs more copper | Demand rising |
| Other miners can't fill gap | Decade-long projects |
| Structural deficit | Higher prices |

**Codelco's problems = everyone else's opportunity.**

---

## Investment angle

**Not directly investable** (state-owned), but:

| Implication | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Supply constraints | Bullish copper price |
| Others fill gap | Bullish [[Freeport-McMoRan]], [[Southern Copper]] |
| Chile risk | Monitor royalty/tax changes |
| Copper demand | Structural thesis intact |

---

## Chile context

Chile produces ~25% of world copper:

| Company | Ownership |
|---------|-----------|
| **Codelco** | State |
| Escondida (BHP) | Private |
| Collahuasi (Anglo/Glencore) | Private |
| Antofagasta | Private (Luksic family) |

Government revenue depends on copper — creates policy tension.
