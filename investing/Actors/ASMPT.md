Hong Kong-listed semiconductor equipment company, one of the world's largest in assembly/packaging and SMT (surface mount technology). Gaining share in HBM TC bonders at [[SK Hynix]]'s expense of [[Hanmi Semiconductor]], but profitability has collapsed post-2021.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Ticker** | 0522.HK |
| **HQ** | Singapore (listed in Hong Kong) |
| **CEO** | Robin Gerard Ng Cher Tat |
| **Revenue (2024)** | HK$13.2B (~$1.7B) |
| **Market Cap** | ~$4B |
| **Founded** | 1975 |
| **IPO** | 1989 (HKEX) |

## What they make

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semiconductor Solutions** | TC bonders, die attach, wire bonding |
| **SMT Solutions** | Surface mount equipment for PCB assembly |
| **Materials** | Leadframes, substrates |

ASMPT is more diversified than pure-play packaging equipment makers like [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] or [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] — this is both a strength (diversification) and weakness (less leverage to HBM boom).

## History

- **1975**: Founded in Hong Kong by Arthur del Prado (ASM founder) and Patrick Lam
- **1989**: IPO on Hong Kong Stock Exchange
- **2022**: Renamed from ASM Pacific Technology to ASMPT
- **2025**: Celebrating 50th anniversary

Originally an Asian sales branch of ASM (Netherlands), evolved into independent equipment manufacturer.

## SK Hynix relationship

ASMPT is gaining TC bonder share as [[SK Hynix]] diversifies away from [[Hanmi Semiconductor]]:

| Event | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Oct 2024** | Order for dozens of TC bonders for HBM3E 12-high |
| **Dec 2025** | 7 TC bonder systems (~₩30B) for HBM4 |
| **Current share** | ~50% of SK Hynix's HBM4 TC bonders |
| **2026E** | Expect large order (100+ units) for M15X fab expansion |

SK Hynix placed the HBM4 order with ASMPT amid [[Hanmi Semiconductor]]-Hanwha patent dispute, accelerating diversification.

## Competitive position

| vs | ASMPT advantage | ASMPT weakness |
|----|-----------------|----------------|
| [[BE Semiconductor Industries\|BESI]] | Broader product line, Asian presence | No hybrid bonding leadership |
| [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] | Benefiting from Hanmi's share loss | Less established with SK Hynix |
| [[Applied Materials]] | More focused on backend | AMAT has broader ecosystem |

ASMPT is the "safe second choice" for memory makers diversifying from Korean suppliers — but lacks [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]]'s hybrid bonding technology lead.

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2021 | HK$22.0B | HK$3.2B | Peak cycle |
| 2022 | HK$19.4B | HK$2.6B | Still strong |
| 2023 | HK$14.7B | HK$715M | Sharp decline |
| 2024 | HK$13.2B | HK$345M | Near breakeven |
| 2025 Q1-Q3 | HK$10.2B | -HK$55M | Loss in Q3 |

Revenue down 40% from 2021 peak. Profitability collapsed — business mix shifting away from high-margin legacy products toward lower-margin advanced packaging.

## Price chart

![[asmpt-price-chart.png]]
*ASMPT (blue) -5% vs [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] (red) +500% since 2020. Massive underperformance reflects BESI's hybrid bonding leadership vs ASMPT's diversified but undifferentiated portfolio. ASMPT's HBM gains haven't translated to stock returns.*

## Fundamentals

![[asmpt-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked at HK$6.2B/quarter in late 2021, declined to ~HK$3.3B through 2023-2024, now stabilizing at ~HK$3.5B. Net income collapsed from HK$1B/quarter to near-zero; Q3 2025 was a loss (-HK$270M).*

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:** HBM share gains at SK Hynix translate to revenue/profit recovery; diversified portfolio provides stability; valuation cheap vs BESI.

**Bear case:** Lacks technology differentiation (no hybrid bonding lead); margin compression continues; BESI wins the packaging equipment war.

The stock is cheap for a reason — ASMPT is gaining HBM share but the overall business is struggling and margins have collapsed.

## Risks

- **Profitability**: Business approaching breakeven; Q3 2025 was a loss
- **Technology**: No hybrid bonding leadership; playing catch-up
- **China exposure**: Significant revenue from China amid geopolitical tensions
- **Competition**: [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] has technology lead, [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] has incumbency
