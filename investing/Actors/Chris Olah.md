# Chris Olah

Co-founder of [[Anthropic]]. Pioneer in neural network interpretability — his work on visualizing what neural networks learn (feature visualization, circuits) is foundational to the field of mechanistic interpretability. Previously at [[Google]] Brain and [[OpenAI]]. Left OpenAI in early 2021 with six colleagues including [[Dario Amodei]] and [[Daniela Amodei]]. Leads interpretability research at Anthropic — the work that underpins the company's claim that safety requires understanding what models are actually doing inside, not just testing their outputs. Still at Anthropic as of February 2026.
