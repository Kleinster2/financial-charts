## Why it matters

Algorhythm triggered the latest wave of the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|AI disruption trade]] on Feb 12, 2026. Two press releases about its SemiCab platform crashed trucking and logistics stocks globally:

| Date | Announcement | Key claim |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Feb 9 | White paper | 70%+ reduction in empty freight miles |
| Feb 12 | Productivity paper | 400% more freight volume per operator (2,000 loads/yr vs 500 benchmark) |

Market damage:

## SemiCab platform

Unlike traditional TMS that optimize individual lanes, SemiCab operates at the network level — pooling demand/supply across shippers, regions, and timeframes to identify return legs and cross-lane flows invisible under conventional planning.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target market | $3T global truckload |
| Empty mile waste | ~$1T/yr (trucks empty ~33% of miles) |
| Live results (India) | >90% loaded-mile utilization, <10% empty |
| ARR | $9.7M (+300% YoY, Dec 2025) |
| US expansion | Via Apex SaaS platform (asset-light, white-label) |

## Skepticism

This was a penny stock before Feb 12. Seeking Alpha flagged it as "a penny-stock AI pitch" spooking established logistics companies. Analysts pushed back:

- [[Barclays]] (Brandon Oglenski): selloff "disproportionate to the risk" — would buy the sector on weakness
- Benchmark (Christopher Kuhn): "unlikely a big corporation is going to put in this software and not use a major truck broker like CH Robinson"

The pattern is identical to [[Altruist]] → wealth management and [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork]] → software: a small company's announcement wiping billions from incumbents in the AI fear trade.
