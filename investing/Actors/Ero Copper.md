## Investment case

**Bull:**

- Brazil = stable mining jurisdiction
- De-leveraging rapidly (2.1x → 0.7x by 2026)
- Gold by-product from Xavantina
- Small/mid-cap growth premium as production doubles

**Bear:**
- Brazil-only risk (FX, regulatory, infrastructure)
- Small market cap = liquidity risk
- Execution risk on Tucuma ramp
- Caraiba underground = higher cost ($2.07/lb)
- High capex phase ($310M in 2026)
- No geographic diversification
