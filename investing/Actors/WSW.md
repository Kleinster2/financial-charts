**WSW** (Waarborgfonds Sociale Woningbouw / Social Housing Guarantee Fund) -- Dutch guarantee fund for social housing association borrowing. Rated Aaa by [[Moody's]] and AAA by S&P. Backed ultimately by Dutch municipalities and the [[Netherlands]] (Dutch State). WSW guarantees loans made by [[BNG Bank]] and [[NWB Bank]] to social housing corporations, enabling 0% risk-weighted lending under Basel rules. The guarantee structure is a key reason BNG can maintain near-zero credit losses on its housing portfolio.
