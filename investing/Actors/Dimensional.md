## Significance

Dimensional converted 7 mutual funds to ETFs and was among the first to embrace the trend. In Nov 2025, the [[SEC]] granted Dimensional formal approval to offer both ETF and mutual fund share classes within the same fund, directing all subsequent applicants to follow Dimensional's template. This is the most important regulatory development for the fund industry since Rule 6c-11.
