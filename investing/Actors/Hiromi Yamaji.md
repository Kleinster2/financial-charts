# Hiromi Yamaji

Group CEO of [[Japan Exchange Group]] / [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] since 2021. Architect of [[Japan]]'s [[Japan corporate governance revolution|corporate governance revolution]] — pushed companies below 1x P/B to publish improvement plans, drove cross-shareholding unwinding and independent director mandates. Describes the core challenge as "transforming the mindset of management."

## Reform results

Under Yamaji's leadership (2021-present):
- Delistings: ~50/year → **125** (2025) → 16 announced in early 2026
- 280 carve-outs/spin-offs in H1 2025 alone (record), ¥35T total deal volume
- Record buybacks across listed companies
- More than half of listed companies now above book value
- Annual assessment using ~400 global investors (domestic and overseas)

On management transformation: "PBR is just a financial indicator to gauge how much you progressed. The fundamental challenge is to transform the mindset of the management."

On carve-outs: sellers recognizing "they are not a good owner" of certain businesses. "That's a good sign."

On AI: "Japanese companies are quite receptive for new development of technologies like AI... already adopters of new technologies. But... you have to be quite serious how to utilize, in what kind of areas."

On private credit: "It's growing gradually... a good alternative funding vehicle. Banks were the main lenders, but because of capital restrictions, their capability to provide lending is getting to a limited amount."

## Culture shift

Since ~2015-16, roughly 1 in 3 new graduates plan to leave their first company. Startups have become one of the most popular career choices for university students — replacing traditional prestige paths (bureaucrats, consultants, investment banks). Yamaji: "It used to be like bureaucrats or consultants or investment banks... but now there's a number of students trying to leave the current company and join the new startups."

## Government support

Every PM since [[Shinzo Abe]] (2015) has backed governance reform: [[Yoshihide Suga]], [[Fumio Kishida]], [[Shigeru Ishiba]], [[Sanae Takaichi]]. All "convinced that growth of the private sector is essential for the growth of the entire Japanese economy."
