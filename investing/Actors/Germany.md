**Germany** — Europe's largest economy. Industrial powerhouse facing energy crisis, [[China]] exposure, and defense transformation.

## Why Germany matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$4.5T (#3 globally) |
| Population | 84M |
| Key sectors | Autos, machinery, chemicals, pharma |
| Government | CDU/CSU-SPD coalition |
| Chancellor | Friedrich Merz (since 2025) |

## Key indices

| Index | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| DAX 40 | Blue chips |
| MDAX | Mid caps |
| TecDAX | Technology |

## Zeitenwende (turning point)

Feb 2022 speech by Scholz after Ukraine invasion. Historic shift in defense posture.

| Initiative | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Special defense fund | €100B |
| Annual defense target | €72B (2% GDP) |
| F-35 purchase | 35 aircraft |
| NATO commitment | 2%+ GDP |

See [[European defense spending]].

## Schuldenbremse reform (2025)

Merz overhauled the constitutional debt brake, enabling ~€1T in borrowing through 2029.

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Infrastructure fund | €500B over 12 years |
| [[Defense]] exemption | Unlimited (above 1% GDP) |
| Total borrowing | ~€850B by 2029 |

**Skeptic view:** [[Deutsche Bank]] sees no significant growth improvement — funds leaking to social spending, subsidies. Debt/GDP could hit 85% by 2035 without commensurate GDP gains.

See [[Schuldenbremse reform]] for full analysis.

## Key sectors

### [[Automotive]]

| Company | Market cap | EV challenge |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| [[Volkswagen]] | ~$55B | ID series struggling vs [[BYD]] |
| [[BMW]] | ~$65B | Strong [[EV transition]] |
| Mercedes | ~$70B | [[Luxury]] EV push |
| Porsche | ~$45B | Premium positioning |

**[[China]] problem:** German autos = 30%+ [[China]] revenue. [[BYD]] eating share.

### Industrials

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Siemens]] | Automation, software, trains |
| Bosch | Auto components (private) |
| BASF | Chemicals |
| Thyssenkrupp | Steel, defense |

### [[Semiconductors]]

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Infineon]] | Power semiconductors, automotive |
| [[Intel]] Magdeburg | Advanced fabs (paused) |
| [[TSMC]] Dresden | Mature nodes (building) |
| Bosch | Auto chips |

### [[Defense]]

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Rheinmetall]] | Armor, ammunition (+400% since 2022) |
| Hensoldt | [[Sensors]], radar |
| KNDS | Tanks (JV with [[France]]) |

### Space

Germany emerging as potential space power with plans to invest **€35B** in space-defense capabilities by 2030.

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Isar Aerospace]] | Orbital launch startup (€500M+ raised) |
| Rocket Factory Augsburg | Launch startup (pre-orbital) |
| OHB | Satellites, systems integration |

**Bundeswehr satellite constellation:** Germany's military reportedly wants its own constellation — domestic launch startups likely beneficiaries.

**ESA role:** Germany is ESA's largest contributor. Two of five European Launcher Challenge recipients are German (Isar, RFA).

## Stagnation (2019-2026)

Germany has grown **0.1% since 2019** — worst five-year stretch in Federal Republic history (since 1949).

| Economy | Growth since 2019 |
|---------|-------------------|
| **US** | +12% |
| **EU average** | +4% |
| **Italy** | >0.1% |
| **Germany** | **+0.1%** |

**No tech dynamism:** Top R&D spenders are the same companies as 20 years ago, all clustered around automotive. No platform economy, no big tech equivalents.

**Low working hours:** ~1,300 hrs/year vs US ~1,750 — Americans work 25-30% more. Rational explanations (childcare availability, work-life balance) rather than Merz's "lifestyle part-time work" framing.

**Merz supply-side populism:** Targeting part-time work protections and telephone sick notes — Tooze calls this "supply-side policy for dummies." High absenteeism likely reflects systemic causes, not malingering.

## European positioning

### "Made with Europe" vs "Buy European"

Germany prefers **"made with Europe"** (supply chain integration) over [[France]]'s **"buy European"** (procurement preference). France's EV subsidy uses carbon standards that favor nuclear-powered production — Chinese EVs don't qualify. Germany resists this as too protectionist, partly to protect its [[China]] business ties.

### Merz-Meloni axis

Merz has aligned with [[Italy]]'s Meloni on manufacturing and defense — presenting Germany and Italy as Europe's two industrial powerhouses. Ironic given [[Olaf Scholz]]'s stated fear of a post-fascist Italian government.

**Three sources of frustration with [[France]]:**
1. [[EU-Mercosur agreement]] — French block in EU Parliament
2. FCAS next-gen fighter — [[Dassault Aviation]] uncooperative with [[Airbus]] on technology sharing
3. "Buy European" protectionism

### Defense leadership ambitions

Merz has openly stated he wants Germany as **Europe's leading military power** — unprecedented for a postwar chancellor. Defense budget set to reach **€162B ($191B) by 2029**, dwarfing France, UK, Italy, Spain. Berlin has explicitly criticized [[France]] for not spending enough on weapons.

This creates a structural imbalance: France/Italy/Spain can't match without EU common debt, and EU SAFE package (~EUR 160B) is smaller than Germany's projected national budget alone. Merz opposes joint European borrowing. Germany controls whether Europe issues common debt — though even Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel has made the case for mutual defense debt.

**"Germany First" risk (Feb 2026):** Preference for German arms manufacturers, cooling on [[FCAS]], eyeing a domestic fighter jet program and own satellite constellation. Former [[Airbus]] CEO Tom Enders dismissed a domestic German fighter as "national hubris." Liana Fix (CFR) calls the combined accumulation of economic and military power "involuntary hegemony."

**European army logic:** Combined European spending already ~2x Russia's — a single force could achieve full-spectrum capability. National budgets cannot. Historical precedent: the 1950s European Defense Community (joint army) was rejected by French parliament in 1954; NATO membership was the fallback.

## Structural challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Energy costs** | 2-3x US industrial power prices |
| **[[China]] exposure** | Autos, machinery dependent on [[China]] market |
| **Demographics** | Aging workforce, immigration debates |
| **Underinvestment** | Infrastructure, digitization lagging |
| **Bureaucracy** | Slow permitting, regulation |
| **No tech sector** | No platform economy or big tech equivalents |
| **Venture capital** | Weakest among major economies |

---

## Energy crisis

[[Russia]] gas cutoff (2022) exposed dependency.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 55% gas from [[Russia]] | Near zero |
| Cheap industrial energy | 2-3x higher prices |
| Nord Stream | Sabotaged |
| Nuclear | Shut down (policy) |

**Industrial impact:** BASF, chemicals, steel facing competitiveness crisis. Some production moving to US.
