**Germany** — Europe's largest economy. Industrial powerhouse facing energy crisis, China exposure, and defense transformation.

## Why Germany matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$4.5T (#3 globally) |
| Population | 84M |
| Key sectors | Autos, machinery, chemicals, pharma |
| Government | CDU/CSU-SPD coalition |
| Chancellor | Friedrich Merz (since 2025) |

---

## Zeitenwende (turning point)

Feb 2022 speech by Scholz after Ukraine invasion. Historic shift in defense posture.

| Initiative | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Special defense fund | €100B |
| Annual defense target | €72B (2% GDP) |
| F-35 purchase | 35 aircraft |
| NATO commitment | 2%+ GDP |

See [[European defense spending]].

## Schuldenbremse reform (2025)

Merz overhauled the constitutional debt brake, enabling ~€1T in borrowing through 2029.

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Infrastructure fund | €500B over 12 years |
| Defense exemption | Unlimited (above 1% GDP) |
| Total borrowing | ~€850B by 2029 |

**Skeptic view:** Deutsche Bank sees no significant growth improvement — funds leaking to social spending, subsidies. Debt/GDP could hit 85% by 2035 without commensurate GDP gains.

See [[Schuldenbremse reform]] for full analysis.

## Key sectors

### Automotive

| Company | Market cap | EV challenge |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Volkswagen | ~$55B | ID series struggling vs [[BYD]] |
| BMW | ~$65B | Strong EV transition |
| Mercedes | ~$70B | Luxury EV push |
| Porsche | ~$45B | Premium positioning |

**China problem:** German autos = 30%+ China revenue. [[BYD]] eating share.

### Industrials

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Siemens]] | Automation, software, trains |
| Bosch | Auto components (private) |
| BASF | Chemicals |
| Thyssenkrupp | Steel, defense |

### Semiconductors

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Infineon]] | Power semiconductors, automotive |
| [[Intel]] Magdeburg | Advanced fabs (paused) |
| [[TSMC]] Dresden | Mature nodes (building) |
| Bosch | Auto chips |

### Defense

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Rheinmetall]] | Armor, ammunition (+400% since 2022) |
| Hensoldt | Sensors, radar |
| KNDS | Tanks (JV with France) |

### Space

Germany emerging as potential space power with plans to invest **€35B** in space-defense capabilities by 2030.

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Isar Aerospace]] | Orbital launch startup (€500M+ raised) |
| Rocket Factory Augsburg | Launch startup (pre-orbital) |
| OHB | Satellites, systems integration |

**Bundeswehr satellite constellation:** Germany's military reportedly wants its own constellation — domestic launch startups likely beneficiaries.

**ESA role:** Germany is ESA's largest contributor. Two of five European Launcher Challenge recipients are German (Isar, RFA).

## Structural challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Energy costs** | 2-3x US industrial power prices |
| **China exposure** | Autos, machinery dependent on China market |
| **Demographics** | Aging workforce, immigration debates |
| **Underinvestment** | Infrastructure, digitization lagging |
| **Bureaucracy** | Slow permitting, regulation |

---

## Energy crisis

Russia gas cutoff (2022) exposed dependency.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 55% gas from Russia | Near zero |
| Cheap industrial energy | 2-3x higher prices |
| Nord Stream | Sabotaged |
| Nuclear | Shut down (policy) |

**Industrial impact:** BASF, chemicals, steel facing competitiveness crisis. Some production moving to US.

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Defense rearmament | [[Rheinmetall]], Hensoldt |
| Semiconductor push | [[Infineon]], equipment suppliers |
| Auto transition | BMW (winner?), VW (struggling) |
| Industrial automation | [[Siemens]] |
| Space-defense | [[Isar Aerospace]], OHB (€35B by 2030) |
