Wall Street financial services firm. Founded 1945. Now run by **[[Brandon Lutnick]]** after his father **[[Howard Lutnick]]** became Trump's Commerce Secretary (2025). Known for fixed income brokerage, real estate, and special situations.

Entered the [[Tariff refund claims market]] in mid-2025, buying rights to IEEPA tariff refunds at cents on the dollar. Traded ~$10M+ with capacity for "several hundred million." Created a conflict-of-interest scandal given Howard Lutnick's role architecting the tariff policy his firm was betting against.
