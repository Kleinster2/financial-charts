# Fannie Mae

Federal National Mortgage Association. Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that securitizes and guarantees residential mortgages.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | FNMA (OTC) |
| Status | Conservatorship since Sep 2008 |
| Regulator | [[FHFA]] |
| Market Cap | ~$15B (Jan 2026) |
| MBS Outstanding | ~$4T |

## Business Model

- **Guarantee fees**: Charges lenders ~50bps annually to guarantee mortgage payments
- **Portfolio income**: Earns spread on retained MBS holdings
- **Does not originate loans**: Buys conforming mortgages from lenders, packages into MBS

## Conservatorship History

- Sep 2008: Placed into conservatorship during financial crisis
- 2008-2019: Net worth sweep sent all profits to Treasury (~$300B total)
- 2019: Net worth sweep ended, began retaining capital
- 2021-present: Building capital toward release, but path unclear

## Jan 2026 MBS Purchase Directive

Trump ordered Fannie and [[Freddie Mac]] to buy $200B of MBS to compress mortgage spreads. Key implications:

- First presidential direct intervention in housing finance via asset purchases
- Spreads dropped ~18bps immediately
- Signals White House views GSEs as policy tools, not just financial entities
- Creates tension with potential IPO (policy lever vs. shareholder returns)
- Bill Pulte (FHFA): "This is the benefit of running things like businesses"

## IPO Considerations

- Trump has signaled intent to pursue public offering
- MBS purchases could support IPO narrative (robust income-generating operations)
- But policy tool usage may deter private investors seeking pure profit motive
- JPMorgan: "tension between targeting the mortgage rate today and go-forward profitability"

## Bull Case

- IPO or recap could unlock massive value for common/preferred shareholders
- Retained earnings building capital base
- Essential infrastructure for US housing market
- Current administration sympathetic to release

## Bear Case

- Perpetual conservatorship risk
- Political football - each administration has different priorities
- Capital requirements for release very high (~$280B combined with Freddie)
- Using GSEs as policy tools reduces standalone profitability

## Trade Considerations (Jan 2026)

### Instruments

| Instrument | Thesis | Risk |
|------------|--------|------|
| FNMA/FMCC common | Lottery ticket on full recap/IPO | Could go to zero if perpetual conservatorship |
| GSE preferreds | Better risk/reward - senior claim, yield | Still subordinate to Treasury's senior preferred |
| Long MBS / short duration | Direct beneficiary of spread compression | Policy could reverse with new admin |
| Homebuilders | Lower mortgage rates = demand tailwind | Rates still elevated historically |

### Key Question

Is this the start of real GSE release, or is the administration discovering that conservatorship is *more* valuable than privatization?

The fact that they're using the balance sheet for policy goals suggests they may not want to give up control. An IPO with retained government influence would be a hybrid that may not satisfy either pure privatization bulls or policy-tool advocates.

### Watch For

- Timing/pace of actual MBS purchases
- Any IPO timeline updates from Trump
- Whether $200B is a ceiling or a floor
- Fed reaction (does this complicate their MBS runoff?)
