# Fannie Mae

Federal National Mortgage Association. Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that securitizes and guarantees residential mortgages.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | FNMA (OTC) |
| Status | Conservatorship since Sep 2008 |
| Regulator | [[FHFA]] |
| Market Cap | ~$15B (Jan 2026) |
| MBS Outstanding | ~$4T |

## Business Model

- **Guarantee fees**: Charges lenders ~50bps annually to guarantee mortgage payments
- **Portfolio income**: Earns spread on retained MBS holdings
- **Does not originate loans**: Buys conforming mortgages from lenders, packages into MBS

## Conservatorship History

- Sep 2008: Placed into conservatorship during financial crisis
- 2008-2019: Net worth sweep sent all profits to Treasury (~$300B total)
- 2019: Net worth sweep ended, began retaining capital
- 2021-present: Building capital toward release, but path unclear

## Jan 2026 MBS Purchase Directive

Trump ordered Fannie and [[Freddie Mac]] to buy $200B of MBS to compress mortgage spreads. Key implications:

- First presidential direct intervention in housing finance via asset purchases
- Spreads dropped ~18bps immediately (could lower mortgage rates ~25bps)
- Signals White House views GSEs as policy tools, not just financial entities
- Creates tension with potential IPO (policy lever vs. shareholder returns)
- Bill Pulte (FHFA): "This is the benefit of running things like businesses"

**Fed independence concerns:**

The move places White House in role traditionally reserved for the Fed. Large-scale asset purchases have historically been Fed's domain (QE).

**Kirill Krylov (Baird):**
> "Buying assets explicitly to manipulate mortgage rates reintroduces political risk into a market that has spent more than a decade trying to distance itself from such practices."

**Jeffrey Gordon (Columbia Law):**
> "For the executive branch to undertake what amounts to a form of monetary policy sets a new precedent and chips away at Fed independence."

No clear constraint on whether Trump could order additional buying beyond initial $200B.

**Impact (week ended Jan 9, 2026):**

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 30-year mortgage rate | **6.18%** | Lowest since Sept 2024 |
| 5-year ARM | 5.42% | 2nd lowest since May 2023 |
| Purchase applications | **+16%** | 2nd highest since Feb 2023 |
| Refinancing | **+40%** | Most since September |

MBS spread compression translating to lower mortgage rates and surging activity.

**Other affordability ideas floated:**
- 50-year mortgages (panned by industry)
- Portable mortgages (take rate with you when moving)
- Prepayment penalties ([[Bill Ackman]] proposal — save ~65bps)
- Ban institutional investors from single-family homes

## IPO Considerations

- Trump has signaled intent to pursue public offering
- MBS purchases could support IPO narrative (robust income-generating operations)
- But policy tool usage may deter private investors seeking pure profit motive
- JPMorgan: "tension between targeting the mortgage rate today and go-forward profitability"

**Vitaliy Liberman (DoubleLine):**
> "Everyone's perception of the IPO is the government is going to fully turn them over to the public. But this suggests that will not happen because they've understood it's an important tool and if they release it into the wild then they've lost control."

## Notable investors

| Investor | Position | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **[[Bill Ackman]]** | Common | $2.40 avg, targets $31 (1,200% upside) |
| **John Paulson** | Preferreds | Since financial crisis |
| **Capital Group** | Common + preferred | $2.7T manager |
| **Discovery Capital** | Preferreds | 10+ years, added pre-election |
| **PointState** | Preferreds | Zach Schreiber |
| **Owl Creek** | Preferreds | Bought for pennies in 2008 |
| **Michael Burry** | Bullish | Notable given 2008 short fame |

**Exited:** Blackstone (fully out).

## Bull Case

**Ackman thesis (Dec 2024):**
- Treasury counts distributions as senior preferred payback
- GSEs raise ~$30B for 2.5% capital ratio
- IPO late 2026 at ~$31/share
- Government profits ~$300B
- "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history"

**General bull:**
- IPO or recap could unlock massive value
- Retained earnings building capital base
- Essential infrastructure for US housing market
- Current administration sympathetic to release
- Biden released roadmap for conservatorship end

## Bear Case

**Skeptics:**

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Donald Layton** (ex-Freddie CEO) | Won't benefit working class, could raise mortgage costs |
| **Michael Kao** (ex-Akanthos) | Shareholders "massively diluted" without gov't largesse |
| **Brian Violino** (Wedbush) | Sell rating — dilution degrades value |
| **Mark Zandi** (Moody's) | Won't be priority for "little guy" president |
| **Mark Calabria** (ex-FHFA) | Retiring senior preferred was "nonstarter" in Trump 1.0 |

**Key risks:**
- Perpetual conservatorship
- Treasury converts to common → massive dilution (vs. writing down $300B)
- Capital requirements very high (~$280B combined)
- Using GSEs as policy tools reduces profitability
- $10T MBS market disruption risk

## Trade Considerations (Jan 2026)

### Instruments

| Instrument | Thesis | Risk |
|------------|--------|------|
| FNMA/FMCC common | Lottery ticket on full recap/IPO | Could go to zero if perpetual conservatorship |
| GSE preferreds | Better risk/reward - senior claim, yield | Still subordinate to Treasury's senior preferred |
| Long MBS / short duration | Direct beneficiary of spread compression | Policy could reverse with new admin |
| Homebuilders | Lower mortgage rates = demand tailwind | Rates still elevated historically |

### Key Question

Is this the start of real GSE release, or is the administration discovering that conservatorship is *more* valuable than privatization?

The fact that they're using the balance sheet for policy goals suggests they may not want to give up control. An IPO with retained government influence would be a hybrid that may not satisfy either pure privatization bulls or policy-tool advocates.

### Watch For

- Timing/pace of actual MBS purchases
- Any IPO timeline updates from Trump
- Whether $200B is a ceiling or a floor
- Fed reaction (does this complicate their MBS runoff?)
