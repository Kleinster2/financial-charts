**LUMA Energy** — Private operator of [[Puerto Rico]]'s electric transmission and distribution grid under a 15-year public-private partnership contract with [[PREPA]]. Joint venture of [[Quanta Services]] and [[ATCO]].

---

## Why LUMA Energy matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Structure | JV: [[Quanta Services]] (50%) + [[ATCO]] / [[Canadian Utilities]] (50%) |
| Contract | 15-year O&M, started June 2021 |
| Contract value | ~$1.5B (fixed fee, does not own assets) |
| Scope | T&D only — ~1.5M meters, ~34K miles of lines |
| Employees | ~4,000 (only ~250 linemen transferred from [[PREPA]]) |

LUMA does not own the grid assets and does not operate generation (that's [[Genera PR]] / [[New Fortress Energy]]).

## Performance and controversies

### Blackouts

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Hurricane Fiona | Sep 2022 | Island-wide blackout, 44 deaths |
| Transmission failure | Apr 2025 | 1.4M customers lost power, water cut to 400K+ |

Grid described by LUMA executives as "very old" and "neglected for decades." An independent report said grid conditions would justify a state of emergency in any other US jurisdiction.

### Funding gap

[[PREPA]] underfunded system operations by 70% between Jul 2024 and Jun 2025. Cumulative underfunding of ~$800M since LUMA took over in 2021.

### Contract threat

Governor [[Jenniffer González Colón]] has moved to terminate LUMA's contract. In Jul 2025, [[P3 Authority]] accused LUMA of grid deficiencies. LUMA disputes findings and sought federal court mediation.
