## Current views (2026)

**Precious metals:** The simultaneous rise in [[Gold]], [[Silver]], and [[Platinum]] reflects a deeper trend shift — capital rotating to "physical stores of value." A crisis of trust driving institutional and sovereign investor flows.

**Gold:** Bullish. Could withstand a 10% correction to ~$3,973 without breaking bullish narrative. Market "no longer dominated by short-term speculative capital" but by "continuing structural demand for safe-haven assets."

**Silver:** Dual role as industrial and investment metal amplifies volatility.
