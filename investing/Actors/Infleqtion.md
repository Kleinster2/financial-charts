## Why Infleqtion matters

**One of few quantum companies with real revenue.** $29M TTM from actual product sales — 3 quantum computers, hundreds of quantum sensors. Customers include [[NVIDIA]], DoD, NASA, UK government.

**Going public via SPAC** with Michael Klein's Churchill Capital Corp X. Expected to close early 2026 with $540M+ gross proceeds.

**CU Boulder's 10th unicorn spinout** — joins strong company (Solidia, Array BioPharma history).

## Founder

| Person | Role | Background |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Dana Anderson** | Chief Science Officer | JILA fellow, CU Boulder professor. Founded ColdQuanta (2007). |

## Technology

**Neutral atom approach:**
- Atoms trapped by laser light ("optical tweezers")
- No need for exotic materials — uses standard atomic physics
- Scalable qubit count by adding more traps
- Both computing and sensing applications

**Key advantage:** Same platform powers both quantum computers AND quantum sensors — diversified product line.

## Products

| Product | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Quantum computers | Computing | 3 sold |
| Quantum sensors | Sensing (precision measurement) | Hundreds sold |
| Albert (cloud QPU) | Cloud access | Available |

**Sensing applications:** Navigation (GPS-denied), timing, magnetic field detection. Real defense/industrial use cases today.

## Illinois expansion

Relocating computing headquarters to Chicago as part of [[Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park]] ecosystem. Part of Governor Pritzker's quantum strategy.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | vs Infleqtion |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| [[Pasqal]] | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| QuEra | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| Atom Computing | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| [[IBM]]/[[Google]] | Superconducting | Different physics |
| IonQ (IONQ) | Trapped ion | Different physics, public comp |

**Infleqtion advantage:** Revenue traction + dual compute/sensing business.

## Investment implications

**Will be directly investable** as INFQ post-SPAC close.

**Comparables:**
| Company | Ticker | Market cap | Revenue |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| IonQ | IONQ | ~$7B | ~$40M |
| Rigetti | RGTI | ~$3B | ~$15M |
| D-Wave | QBTS | ~$2B | ~$10M |

At $1.8B valuation with $29M revenue and 80% CAGR, Infleqtion appears relatively reasonably valued vs public peers.

**Watch for:**
- SPAC closing timeline
- Post-merger trading (SPACs often volatile)
- Revenue growth continuation
- [[NVIDIA]] partnership expansion
- IQMP facility buildout
