## The YC ethos

See [[YC startup philosophy]] for the full framework.

**Summary:** [[Paul Graham]]'s essays codified startup culture. Core ideas — "make something people want," "do things that don't scale," "ramen profitable," "default alive" — are now the default startup playbook. These ideas spread far beyond YC to become Silicon Valley's operating system.

## What makes YC work

**Core insight:** YC is a network effect business disguised as an investment fund.

### The flywheel

| Component | How it compounds |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Brand** | 1% acceptance → prestige → better applicants → better outcomes → stronger brand |
| **Network** | 5,300+ founders on Bookface → warm intros, advice, hiring, customers |
| **Demo Day** | Concentrated investor attention → competitive term sheets → higher valuations |
| **Alumni returning** | [[Sam Altman]], Garry Tan, Michael Seibel came back → credibility loop |

### Structural innovations

| Innovation | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Standard terms** | No negotiation. $500K for 7%. Removes friction, scales infinitely. |
| **Batch model** | Fund cohorts, not individuals. Peer accountability, lifelong bonds. |
| **3-month program** | Forces urgency. Demo Day is a forcing function. |
| **Founder-run** | Paul Graham was a founder (Viaweb). Built for hackers, not MBAs. |
| **Bookface** | Internal social network. 5,300 nodes, all interconnected. |

### The math

| Metric | YC | Industry |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Unicorn rate | 4.5% | 2.5% |
| Power law | Top 4 = 84% of value | Similar |

YC doesn't need most companies to succeed. They need Stripe, Airbnb, Coinbase. The model tolerates 95% "failures" because the winners are massive.

### What can't be copied

| Moat | Why it's durable |
|------|-----------------|
| **20-year head start** | Started 2005, before most accelerators existed |
| **Paul Graham's essays** | Cultural canon for startup founders |
| **The alumni graph** | 5,300 nodes, all interconnected, helping each other |
| **Reputation signal** | "If YC funded them, they're legit" — de-risks for investors |
| **Returning alumni** | Best founders come back as partners (Altman, Tan, Seibel) |

---

## Continuity Fund (discontinued)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purpose | Follow-on investments in later stages |
| Size | $2.75B raised |
| Status | Wound down by Garry Tan (2023) |
| Reason | Refocus on core early-stage mission |

---

## Investment relevance

**Why track Y Combinator**:

1. **Startup trend signal** — Batch composition shows where founders are building (AI, climate, fintech).

2. **Unicorn factory** — 4.5% unicorn rate vs 2.5% industry. Disproportionate hit rate.

3. **AI acceleration** — 25% of W25 batch has 95% AI-written code. Signals founder productivity revolution.

4. **Pre-IPO access** — Alumni like Stripe, Scale AI are major pre-IPO opportunities.

5. **[[Network effects]]** — YC founders help YC founders. Creates compounding advantage.
