**Isar [[Aerospace]]** — German launch startup building the Spectrum rocket. One of [[Europe]]'s most advanced private orbital launch challengers, aiming to break [[SpaceX]]'s dominance in European launch services.

---

## Why Isar matters

[[Europe]] completed just 7 orbital launches in 2025 vs [[SpaceX]]'s 130+. Isar represents the continent's bet that venture-backed startups, not state consortiums, can close the gap. Germany's €35B space-defense investment plan (by 2030) provides potential government demand.

## Spectrum rocket

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Length | 28 meters |
| Class | Small launcher |
| Reusable | No (not yet) |
| Launch site | Andøya, Norway |
| Factory capacity target | 30+ rockets/year |
| New factory | 40,000 sqm near Munich (under construction) |

## Launch history

| Date | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2025 | First launch attempt — flew ~30 seconds, crashed into Norwegian Sea |
| 2026 (planned) | Second launch attempt from Norway |

[[SpaceX]] needed 4 attempts to reach orbit with Falcon 1. Launch failures are common for new vehicles.

## Competitive landscape: European launchers

| Company | Country | Status | Funding model |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Isar [[Aerospace]]** | Germany | Most advanced, first launch attempted | VC-backed |
| Rocket Factory Augsburg | Germany | Pre-orbital | VC-backed |
| PLD Space | Spain | Pre-orbital | VC-backed |
| MaiaSpace | [[France]] | Ariane Group subsidiary | Corporate |
| Orbex | [[UK]] | Pre-orbital | VC-backed |
| Ariane 6 | [[Europe]] (consortium) | Flying (2024), 10/yr by 2027 | Government |

All five startups received ESA European Launcher Challenge funding (from €900M pool).

---

## Funding context

**ESA European Launcher Challenge (Nov 2025):**
- Part of record **€22B** ESA 3-year funding approval
- **€900M** allocated to 5 launcher startups (Isar, RFA, PLD, MaiaSpace, Orbex)
- Buys services + funds capacity upgrades

**Germany space-defense (2025-2030):**
- €35B planned investment in space-defense capabilities
- Bundeswehr reportedly wants own satellite constellation
- German launch startups (Isar, RFA) likely beneficiaries

---

## Bull case

- ESA + German military demand provides revenue visibility
- Vertical integration + automation (30 rockets/yr factory) positions for cost competition
- First-mover among European VC-backed launchers
- Experienced team ([[SpaceX]] alumni, serial founders)
- Small launchers offer flexibility [[SpaceX]] can't (dedicated orbits, timing control)

## Bear case

- First launch failed — still pre-revenue, pre-orbit
- Not reusable ([[SpaceX]] cost advantage remains)
- Small launchers don't compete on $/kg with Falcon 9
- VC-backed space ventures have high mortality (Virgin Orbit bankruptcy 2023)
- Geo-return policy fragments European space funding
- Crowded field: 5 funded European startups for limited demand
