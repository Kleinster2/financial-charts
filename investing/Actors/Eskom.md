## Load shedding crisis

Eskom's decade-plus power crisis defined South Africa's economic trajectory:

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| 2007-08 | First load shedding — exposed underinvestment |
| 2014-15 | Escalation — cost mining sector billions |
| 2019-23 | Peak crisis — rolling blackouts, up to Stage 6 |
| 2024-25 | Stabilization — reduced load shedding |
| 2026 | Seeking partners for reindustrialization |

Impact on industry:
- [[Aluminum]] smelters closed (energy-intensive, uncompetitive)
- Mining output constrained
- Manufacturing exodus to neighbors
- [[South African rand]] weakened during worst periods

## Cheap power partnership push (Jan 2026)

Chairman Mteto Nyati at Davos (Jan 21, 2026): Eskom seeking partners to realize cheap industrial power as basis for reindustrialization.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tariff trajectory | 8x increase since 2008 |
| Industrial impact | Smelters closing, mining constrained |
| Partners sought | [[Japan]], [[China]] — industrialization models |
| Goal | Cheap power as foundation for manufacturing |

Context: South Africa studying Japan and China's post-war/reform industrialization models where cheap electricity enabled heavy industry buildout. Eskom wants to reverse the damage from tariff escalation.
