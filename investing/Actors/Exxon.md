**Exxon** — World's largest Western oil company. Massive cash flows funding energy transition hedges. Data center power potential via natural gas.

## Why Exxon matters for AI thesis

Oil majors have relevance to AI infrastructure:

| Connection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Natural gas | Fuel for gas peaker plants powering data centers |
| Cash flows | Funding diversification into low-carbon |
| Carbon capture | Potential offset for data center emissions |
| Scale | Can fund massive energy projects |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Upstream | Oil & gas production |
| Downstream | Refining, chemicals |
| Low Carbon | CCS, hydrogen, biofuels |

---

## Data center angle

**Natural gas for AI power:**
- Gas plants complement renewables (baseload)
- Faster to build than nuclear
- [[Crusoe Energy]] model — gas-to-compute
- Some hyperscalers using gas backup

---

## Low carbon investments

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Carbon capture (CCS) | Major investments, Houston hub |
| Hydrogen | Blue hydrogen projects |
| Lithium | Entered lithium extraction (Arkansas) |
| Biofuels | Renewable diesel |

**Hedging:** Using oil cash flows to fund energy transition bets.

## Venezuela — exited and sued

**Exxon refused nationalization:**

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 2007 | Chavez demanded 60% PDVSA control |
| 2007 | Exxon refused, exited Venezuela |
| 2007-2014 | Arbitration proceedings |
| 2014 | Won $1.6B award (less than $12B sought) |

**Contrast with Chevron:** Exxon left, Chevron stayed. Chevron now has exclusive US access.

**Lesson:** Exxon prioritized principle over access — may have been right (Chevron's upside still uncertain).

**January 2026 update:** US captured Maduro. Trump announced US will "run" Venezuela and take control of oil reserves, seeking American companies to invest billions. Exxon's 2007 exit could reverse — potential return opportunity under new regime.

See [[Venezuela]], [[Maduro capture 2026]], and [[WH oil executives Venezuela meeting 2026-01-09]] for full context.

**Jan 9, 2026:** CEO Darren Woods attended White House meeting. Expressed deep skepticism: "To re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen." He further stated that Venezuela was **"uninvestable"** given the current legal and commercial frameworks.

**Jan 12, 2026 — Trump retaliates:** Trump said he "didn't like Exxon's response" and is "inclined to keep Exxon out" of Venezuela. Called them "playing too cute." Signals Exxon may be excluded from Venezuela rebuild while [[Chevron]] benefits.

- Energy security demand
- Diversification into lithium, CCS
- Dividend aristocrat

**Bear:**
- Peak oil demand concerns
- ESG divestment pressure
- Stranded asset risk
- Regulatory/carbon tax risk
- Not a pure AI play
