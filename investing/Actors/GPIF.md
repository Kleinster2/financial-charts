# GPIF

The **Government Pension Investment Fund** — [[Japan]]'s public pension fund and the largest pool of investment capital on Earth at **$1.7 trillion** AUM. Manages retirement savings for Japan's national pension system.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $1.7T (2025) |
| Type | Public pension |
| Allocation | ~25% domestic equities, ~25% foreign equities, ~25% domestic bonds, ~25% foreign bonds |
| Benchmark | MSCI ACWI ex-Japan (switched Apr 2025 to exclude onshore China) |

## Why it matters

GPIF's sheer scale means any allocation shift moves markets. In **April 2025**, GPIF switched its foreign equity benchmark to one that **excludes onshore Chinese shares** — the world's largest investor formally signaling China is too risky for default allocation. This gave institutional cover for the broader [[Japan-instead-of-China trade]] rotation.

As [[Japan]] reflates and [[BOJ]] rates normalize, GPIF also faces pressure to shift from JGBs (which yielded negative for years) toward higher-returning assets — a domestic catalyst for equity flows.
