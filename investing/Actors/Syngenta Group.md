## The $43B acquisition (2017)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Buyer | [[ChemChina]] (state-owned) |
| Price | $43B |
| Significance | China's largest foreign acquisition |
| Strategic goal | Improve China's food security via advanced seeds/chemicals |

- Patent-protected seeds
- Biotech capabilities (first [[GM]] cereal for humans)
- Rice genome sequencing
- Gene-editing crop technology

---

## IPO delays

The IPO has been approved but repeatedly delayed:

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Valuation disputes | $60B target vs market skepticism |
| Regulatory shuffling | Switched from STAR Market to Main Board |
| Market conditions | China equity markets weak |
| Geopolitical | US-China tensions affect sentiment |

---

## Why it matters

China food security play. Beijing views Syngenta as strategic infrastructure for agricultural self-sufficiency. The IPO would:
- Raise capital for R&D
- Provide domestic listing for national champion
- [[Signal]] confidence in China capital markets
