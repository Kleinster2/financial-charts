## Investment case

Bull:
- #1 China cybersecurity hardware with 11.1% share — market leader
- Dual growth engines: cybersecurity + cloud infrastructure (HCI)
- aSV hypervisor positions as VMware alternative (post-Broadcom licensing disruption)
- International revenue growing 39% — early but accelerating
- Security GPT = AI-native cybersecurity differentiation
- Government/SOE customer base (54%) = stable, recurring
- Profitable with 61.5% gross margins

Bear:
- 97% China revenue — concentration risk
- Government customer concentration (54%) — policy-dependent
- FY2024 revenue flat (-1.9%) — growth stall before Q3 recovery
- ~$6.9B market cap on ~$200M profit — rich valuation (~35x P/E)
- Qi An Xin dominates central government (90%+)
- International cybersecurity market dominated by [[Palo Alto Networks]], [[Fortinet]], [[CrowdStrike]]
- China macro weakness could pressure government IT budgets
