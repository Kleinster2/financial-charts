## Regulatory philosophy

**"Minimum effective dose"** — regulate enough to protect markets, no more.

Key quotes (Jan 2026):
- "Arbitrary, cumbersome and opaque rules will not stand the test of time."
- "An end to policymaking through enforcement."
- "I'm in favor of the minimum effective dose of regulation, no more, no less."

**Contrast with predecessors:** Biden-era CFTC proposed banning sports event contracts. Selig withdrew that proposal day one.
