## China property crisis impact

The company's entire customer base is property developers. When [[Evergrande]], [[Country Garden]], [[Sunac]], and others defaulted, Ming Yuan Cloud faced:

- Revenue declined from peak (~2021) through 2024 — three consecutive years of decline
- Net losses: ~RMB 1.15B (2022), ~RMB 586M (2023) — reflecting revenue decline and bad debt from defaulted developers
- Market cap collapsed from ~HK$56B+ (mid-2021 at ~HK$29/share) to ~HK$7.1B — 87% destruction
- Named clients included Wanda Group, Shimao, Agile, Sunac, China Overseas Land & Investment — several of which defaulted

Response: Aggressive cost cutting (total expenses -28.8% in 2024; selling expenses -22.2%, G&A -56.5% in H1 2025). Strategic pivot from residential-focused CRM to commercial/asset management SaaS (Space Cloud, Cloud Lease). Share buybacks signal confidence (HK$144.7M through Dec 2025).

## Investment case

Bull:
- Turnaround confirmed — FY2025 ~RMB 190M profit after three years of losses
- RMB 3.8B cash, zero debt on ~HK$7.1B market cap — cash = ~50% of market cap
- Near-monopoly in property developer software (99/100 top developers)
- Pivot to commercial/asset management SaaS reduces residential dependency
- AI driving internal cost efficiency (per management)
- Share buybacks signal management confidence
- If China property stabilizes, revenue could re-accelerate from a low base

Bear:
- China residential market still in adjustment — no floor yet
- Revenue declined three consecutive years and may not recover
- Market share data is stale (2019) — may have eroded as developer clients went bankrupt
- Stock down 87% from peak — value trap risk
- TAM of "property developer software" may be permanently smaller post-crisis
- On-premise declining, cloud SaaS also declining in residential segments
- 7,000 clients but many may be financially distressed
