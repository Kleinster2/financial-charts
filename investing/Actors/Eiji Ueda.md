## Views on Japan

**On the deflation-to-inflation shift:**
- Cash was king for 30 years because deflation made it the rational choice — not cultural conservatism
- With inflation near 3%, cash is "the worst asset to own"
- People make economically rational decisions — now that macro has shifted, capital allocation will follow

**On reform catalysts:**
- Covid supply chain breakdown gave corporates "excuses" to pass prices to retail for the first time
- CPI went from 0/negative to almost 3%
- [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] pushing capital efficiency — more than 50% of listed companies were trading below book
- Household cash: ¥2,000T ($13T+), with 55% in cash historically, now shifting

**On private credit opportunity:**
- Japan's corporate bond market is only ¥60T outstanding — small relative to the economy
- Most corporate financing has been through banks (effectively private credit already)
- But banks face capital constraints limiting their lending capacity
- Demand for longer-dated, complex financing structures that banks can't efficiently provide
- Apollo positioned as complement to banks, not competitor
