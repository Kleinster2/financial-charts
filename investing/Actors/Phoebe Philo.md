## Céline era (2008-2017)

**Transformation:** Took a sleepy bourgeois label and created a global fashion force. Defined "quiet luxury" before it had a name — minimal, intellectual, anti-logo.

**Results:**
- Revenue: grew to ~$900M annually (analyst estimates)
- Cultural influence: Most-copied aesthetic of the 2010s
- Celebrity following: Fashion editors, creative class

**Signature:** Oversized coats, wide-leg trousers, minimal accessories, the Luggage bag, Trio bag

**Exit:** Left in 2017 for personal reasons. Hedi Slimane replaced her (different aesthetic).

## Chloé era (2001-2006)

Appointed at 27. Created romantic, bohemian femininity that defined the brand. Commercial success. Departed 2006 when pregnant, prioritizing family.

**Legacy:** Trained [[Chemena Kamali]] (now Chloé CD) during this period.

## Own brand (2023–)

**Launch:** October 2023, after multiple delays. Direct-to-consumer via phoebephilo.com.

**Structure:**
- Philo and husband = majority owners
- [[LVMH]] = minority investor

**Distribution expansion (2024):**
- Bergdorf Goodman (exclusive initially)
- Dover Street Market (London, Paris)
- 10 Corso Como (Milan)
- Maxfield, Neiman Marcus (LA)
- The Webster (Miami)

**Reception:** Critical acclaim but small scale. Vintage Philo designs (Céline era) reportedly outperforming new collections on resale market.

## Design philosophy

**Aesthetic:** Minimal, intellectual, anti-trend. Clothes for women who don't need to prove anything.

**Approach:** Notoriously private. Rarely interviews. No personal social media. Let clothes speak.

**Quote:** Designs for "a woman who doesn't feel the need to prove anything through fashion."
