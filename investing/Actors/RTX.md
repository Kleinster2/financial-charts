**RTX** — [[Defense]] and aerospace. Missiles, air defense, jet engines (Pratt & Whitney). Formed from [[Raytheon]] + United Technologies merger (2020).

## Trump defense policy (Jan 2026)

### Budget ($1.5T) — Jan 7

Stock rallied with peers on $1.5T budget announcement (+66% increase).

### Executive order — Jan 8

Stock fell **-2.5%** (less than peers — already priced as target).

Trump singled out RTX, calling them:
- "Least responsive to needs of the DoD"
- "Slowest in increasing volume"
- "Most aggressive spending on shareholders rather than military needs"

Threatened to cut off from DoD contracts unless production investment increases.

See [[Trump defense budget]] for full context.

## Key programs

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Patriot** | Air/missile defense (global) |
| **NASAMS** | National air defense (Ukraine) |
| **Stinger** | MANPADS (Ukraine demand) |
| **Tomahawk** | [[Cruise]] missiles |
| **SM-6** | Naval air defense (600+ backlog) |
| **F135** | F-35 engine (Pratt) |
| **GTF** | Commercial engine (Pratt) |
| **Phantom Strike** | Radar (X-62A contract, Dec 2025) |

### [[Golden Dome]] opportunity

RTX is key contractor for Trump's missile-defense system. $151B initial contract, potentially **$1T+ total** (Bloomberg). RTX provides radar, missiles, sensors.

### SM-6 delivery issues

RTX fell behind on 600+ SM-6 air-defense missiles to US Navy. Company's view: supply chain issues, not lack of investment. Trump's view: underinvestment in production.

## [[Capital allocation]] controversy

### Since 2020

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Buybacks | ~$18B |
| Dividends | ~$17B |
| **Total** | **~$35B** |

Second-highest among primes (after Lockheed).

### The fundamental tension

Bloomberg Intelligence: [[Defense]] companies have "average profit margins and little chance of breakout earnings." Capital returns are how they attract investors given slow growth.

Trump's criticism: Shareholders getting more than production.

### Executive order impact (Jan 2026)

| Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Dividend ban | ~$3B/year frozen |
| Buyback ban | $10B+ program paused |
| Exec pay cap | $5M max |

Stock fell 2.5% on announcement (less than peers — already priced as target).

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- $200B backlog = years of visibility
- Ukraine/global rearmament tailwind
- Pratt engines critical for F-35
- Diversified defense + commercial

**Bear:**
- Trump administration hostility
- Capital return restrictions
- F-35 engine sustainment issues
- GTF powder metal recall costs
- Production capacity constraints

**Key question:** Can RTX navigate Trump hostility while others may get favorable treatment?

## Rare earth exposure

Like [[Lockheed Martin]], depends on [[China]]-controlled rare earths:

| Application | Elements |
|-------------|----------|
| Missile guidance | Nd, Sm |
| Radar systems | Tb, Dy |
| Jet engines | Various |
