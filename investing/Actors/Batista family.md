## The corruption scandal (2017)

### What happened

In May 2017, Wesley and Joesley Batista admitted to Brazilian Federal Police that they had bribed officials for 12 years to secure:
- Below-market BNDES loans (R$10B+)
- Access to government pension funds
- Regulatory approvals

### Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Politicians bribed | 1,800+ |
| Total bribes paid | R$600M+ |
| Presidents implicated | Temer, Rousseff, Lula |
| BNDES funding obtained | R$10B+ |

### The Temer recording

Joesley secretly recorded President Michel Temer on March 7, 2017, discussing payments to silence jailed politician Eduardo Cunha. The recording triggered a political crisis and nearly brought down Temer's government.

### Settlements

| Entity | Amount | Terms |
|--------|--------|-------|
| J&F → Brazil | R$10.3B ($2B) | 25 years |
| J&F → US DOJ | $256M | Resolved |
| Personal fines | R$225M | Brothers |

The brothers received immunity from prosecution in exchange for cooperation.

## The BNDES relationship

[[BNDES]] (Brazil's state development bank) was central to JBS's expansion:

| Acquisition | Year | BNDES funding |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| Swift & Co | 2007 | Part of R$5.6B package |
| Smithfield beef | 2008 | Part of R$5.6B package |
| Pilgrim's Pride | 2009 | Part of R$5.6B package |

Prosecutors alleged the funding was quid pro quo for bribes — JBS got below-market rates and fast approvals.

BNDES still holds ~21% of JBS through BNDESPar.

## Return to power (2024)

In April 2024, shareholders initially voted against returning Wesley and Joesley to the JBS board. A late flood of proxy votes reversed the decision.

Critics argue the family never truly lost control — J&F maintained its ~45% stake throughout the scandal.
