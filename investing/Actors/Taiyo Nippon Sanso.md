## Semiconductor gases overview

| Gas type | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Etch gases** | SF6, NF3, CF4 — remove material |
| **Deposition gases** | SiH4, TEOS — add thin films |
| **Doping gases** | AsH3, PH3, B2H6 — modify silicon |
| **Purge/carrier gases** | N2, Ar, He — ultra-pure |
| **Clean gases** | NF3, ClF3 — chamber cleaning |

**Purity requirement:** 99.9999%+ (6N to 9N purity).

## Market position

### Global specialty gas market

| Company | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Air Products | Top tier |
| Linde | Top tier |
| [[Air Liquide]] | Top tier |
| **Taiyo Nippon Sanso** | Top tier |
| Messer | Top tier |

**Top 5 = 94% of global specialty gas market.**

### [[Japan]] market

**\#1 in [[Japan]]** for semiconductor specialty gases.

---

## Strategy

**Local supply security:**
- Modular specialty gas plants near fabs
- [[Japan]] and [[Southeast Asia]] focus
- Kumamoto site (Jan 2023) for TSMC [[Japan]]

**Geographic expansion:**
- US operations
- [[Southeast Asia]] (Singapore, Malaysia)
- Following fab buildout

---

## Why specialty gases matter

Every chip process step requires gases:
- **EUV lithography:** Hydrogen for source, nitrogen purge
- **Etch:** Fluorine-based gases
- **Deposition:** Silane, metal organics
- **Cleaning:** NF3 chamber clean

**More process steps = more gas consumption.**

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Japan]] fab buildout (TSMC Kumamoto, [[Rapidus]])
- Specialty gases = consumables (recurring)
- High purity = high margins
- Oligopoly structure
- Mitsubishi backing

**Bear:**
- Competition from Air Liquide, Linde
- [[China]] localization attempts
- Cyclical fab utilization
- Energy costs (gas production)
- Low-GWP gas transition costs
