Facing antitrust lawsuits from the [[AMA]] alleging it operates as an illegal price-fixing cartel for insurers.

## Why Claritev matters

**Canonical SPAC disaster.** One of [[Michael Klein]]'s most infamous deals. Churchill III merged at $11B valuation (12.9x forward EBITDA) in October 2020. Within a month, [[Muddy Waters]] published a devastating short report. Stock crashed from ~$10 to ~$7, then continued declining to ~$1 by late 2024. Now ~90% below SPAC merger price — a textbook example of SPAC value destruction.

**Antitrust reckoning.** The [[AMA]], joined by dozens of medical associations, is suing Claritev for operating an illegal "hub-and-spoke" price-fixing conspiracy. ~700 of ~1,100 US insurers use Claritev's algorithms to set out-of-network rates. The DOJ filed a statement of interest supporting the plaintiffs in March 2025. Trial could reshape healthcare reimbursement.

## Price history

![[claritev-price-chart.png]]
*SPAC price ($10) was a ceiling, not a floor. Muddy Waters report (Nov 2020) triggered initial collapse. Multi-year decline to ~$5 (late 2024) reflected revenue erosion + $4.5B debt burden.*

![[claritev-vs-spy.png]]
*vs SPY. Since merger close (Oct 2020): CTEV -90%, SPY +140%. Catastrophic relative underperformance.*

## Financials

![[claritev-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked Q1 2022 (~$315M quarterly) before UnitedHealth competition and client attrition. Q4 2022 loss (-$650M) = goodwill impairment. Q3 2024 loss (-$1.46B) = another massive impairment as valuation collapsed.*

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2021 | $1,118M | $102M | First full year post-merger |
| 2022 | $1,080M | -$573M | Goodwill impairment |
| 2023 | $962M | -$92M | Continued decline |
| 2024 | $931M | -$1,646M | Massive impairment |

Revenue declined 17% from 2021 to 2024. The company has been consistently unprofitable since 2022.

## The SPAC deal

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SPAC | Churchill Capital III (CCXX) |
| Sponsor | [[Michael Klein]] |
| Merger close | October 8, 2020 |
| Enterprise value | $11B (12.9x 2021E EBITDA) |
| Capital raised | $3.7B |
| Seller | [[Hellman & Friedman]] (remained largest shareholder) |

**Private equity flip.** [[Hellman & Friedman]] bought MultiPlan in 2016, then sold it to public markets via SPAC just 4 years later at peak valuations. Classic "necrophilia" deal (Muddy Waters' term) — private equity extracting value from a declining business.

---

## The Muddy Waters report

On November 11, 2020 — one month after merger close — [[Muddy Waters]] published "MultiPlan: Private Equity Necrophilia Meets The Great 2020 Money Grab."

**Key allegations:**
- [[UnitedHealth]] (largest client, ~35% of revenue) was building a competitor (Naviguard)
- Revenue would fall 35% and free cash flow 80% within two years
- Business model was "fundamentally flawed" — profited from high healthcare costs
- Potential bankruptcy risk

Stock dropped 20% on the report. The allegations proved largely correct: UnitedHealth shifted volume away, and revenue has declined every year since.

## The antitrust lawsuit

**Filed:** October 2024 (AMA/Illinois State Medical Society)
**Consolidated:** Illinois federal court
**Status:** Motion to dismiss denied (June 2025)

**The allegation:** Claritev operates as the "hub" in a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy. ~700 insurers (spokes) use Claritev's algorithm to set out-of-network rates. Instead of competing on reimbursement, insurers coordinate through a common intermediary — textbook antitrust violation.

**The math:** Claritev processed $106B in out-of-network charges in 2019 (81.5% market share). Plaintiffs allege $19B in provider underpayments in 2020.

**DOJ involvement:** Filed statement of interest in March 2025 supporting plaintiffs: "Competitors' use of algorithmic technologies to coordinate their decision-making poses a growing threat to the free market competition."

**Co-conspirators named:** Aetna ([[CVS Health]]), [[Cigna]], [[UnitedHealth]], Health Care Service Corporation

Claritev denies wrongdoing. Trial outcome could reshape how insurers set reimbursement rates.

## Business model

Claritev offers three service categories:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Analytics** | Algorithms to detect claim overcharges and recommend reimbursement |
| **Networks** | Contracted discounts with healthcare providers |
| **Payment integrity** | Identify improper charges |

The core controversy: Claritev's incentives align with recommending *lower* payments to providers. Insurers save money, Claritev takes a cut. Providers — and by extension patients — bear the cost through balance billing disputes and reduced access.

## Debt situation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net debt | $4.6B |
| First-lien leverage | 8.1x |
| Refinancing | Dec 2024 (99.75% participation) |
| Maturity extension | ~3 years |

The company successfully refinanced in late 2024, extending maturities and avoiding near-term default. But 8.1x leverage on a declining-revenue business with $577M EBITDA leaves little margin for error.

---

## Rebrand

Renamed from MultiPlan to Claritev in February 2025. Ticker changed from MPLN to CTEV on February 28, 2025. The rebrand came amid the antitrust lawsuits — critics called it an attempt to distance from negative associations.
