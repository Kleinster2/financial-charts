## Foundation transition (Feb 15, 2026)

[[Sam Altman]] announced OpenClaw will become an independent foundation, with [[OpenAI]] continuing to support it. Steinberger simultaneously joins OpenAI to work on personal agents.

**Altman:** "OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support. The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that."

**Steinberger:** "It's always been important to me that OpenClaw stays open source and given the freedom to flourish."

**Strategic parallel:** Mirrors [[Anthropic]]'s [[MCP]] and [[Skills]] open-standard strategy. Both frontier labs now backing open agent infrastructure — competing for ecosystem gravity rather than platform lock-in.

## Anthropic conflict timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Nov 2025 | Launched as "Clawdbot" — personal project by [[Peter Steinberger]] |
| Jan 9, 2026 | [[Anthropic]] restricted Claude Code OAuth access, breaking Clawdbot integrations. This was the initial disruption — 18 days before any naming dispute |
| Jan 27, 2026 | Anthropic sent cease-and-desist over "Clawdbot" name (trademark claim on "Claude") |
| Jan 2026 | Rebranded Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw |
| Feb 15, 2026 | [[Sam Altman]] announced Steinberger joining [[OpenAI]]; OpenClaw moving to independent foundation |

The OAuth cutoff preceded and was distinct from the naming dispute. Anthropic's crackdown on third-party Claude Code access (targeting tools like OpenCode, Clawdbot) broke integrations before any trademark action. This sequence drew significant developer community backlash (Craig Weiss tweet: "Anthropic messed up so badly with how they handled Clawdbot" — 580 likes, 27K views, Feb 2026).

## Security concerns

China MIIT flagged OpenClaw as potential security risk when improperly configured — could expose users to cyberattacks and data breaches. Highlights tension between open-source agent autonomy and enterprise security requirements. See [[Agentic AI security]].
