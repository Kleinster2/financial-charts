## AI disintermediation fears (Feb 11, 2026)

Stock fell ~5% as AI disruption fears spread from US wealth managers to UK/European peers. Part of a broader rout triggered by [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI tax planning tool:

| Company | Drop | Market |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[St. James's Place]] | -11% | UK |
| [[AJ Bell]] | -6.5% | UK |
| Quilter | -5% | UK |
| [[Rathbones]] | -4% | UK |
| [[DWS]] | — | Germany |
| [[Julius Baer]] | — | Switzerland |
| [[FinecoBank]] | — | Italy |

Quilter's own head of technology research (Ben Barringer, [[Quilter Cheviot]]) acknowledged the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] as a "significant point" for software/IT disruption, but argued wealth management faces different dynamics — security, data ownership, and regulatory requirements limit AI replacement of human advice.

Counter-thesis: same as [[St. James's Place]] — FCA regulatory moat, relationship complexity, and strong operational performance (Q3 2025 net inflows +48% YoY, £2.2B) suggest narrative contagion rather than fundamental threat.
