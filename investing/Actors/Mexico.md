# Mexico

North America's manufacturing hub and emerging market with one of the world's most attractive carry trades.

## Investment case

Mexico sits at the intersection of three major themes:
1. **Nearshoring** — US-China decoupling driving manufacturing relocation
2. **Carry trade** — 325bp rate differential vs Fed (7% vs 3.75%)
3. **USMCA access** — ~80% of exports to US remain duty-free

The peso appreciated ~23% against USD in 2025 — largest gain since 1994.

## Economy

**GDP growth:**
- 2025: 0.5% (confirmed — puny expansion)
- 2026: 1.4% (economist consensus, Feb 2026)

**Business confidence:** Already pessimistic, fell further in Jan 2026. Investment gauge (construction, machinery, technology) posting continuous annual declines since mid-2024.

**Inflation:** Moderating toward Banxico's 3% target, expected to reach it by mid-2026. Currently in 4% range.

**Unemployment:** 2.6% (Oct 2025) — tight labor market.

**Public investment:** Double-digit YoY drops under Sheinbaum, constrained by budget deficit inherited from [[AMLO]]. Under AMLO, aggregate investment growth peaked at seasonally-adjusted 19.7% in 2023 (heavily driven by public spending). Post-election, investment went negative and was running approximately -10% YoY by late 2025 (INEGI data through Nov 2025).

## Monetary policy (Banxico)

- Policy rate: 7% (Dec 2025), down from peak
- Expected to ease to ~6.5% by end of 2026
- 325bp spread over Fed funds supports peso carry trade
- Gradual easing cycle — more cautious than Fed
- Governor Victoria Rodríguez reportedly unwilling to meet investors, financial analysts, or attend central banker gatherings

## Foreign direct investment

Record $41B FDI through Q3 2025 (+15% YoY). Government touts as Plan México success. Key stats:
- **Manufacturing:** 37% of total FDI (autos, electronics, medical devices)
- **New projects:** Only $6.5B of $41B total were completely new projects — rest was reinvestment and capital injections to existing operations
- **Sources:** US (30%), Spain, Netherlands, Japan, Canada
- **2026 forecast:** $40-45B

Chinese investment notably cautious given US/Mexico scrutiny and tariff uncertainty — though that may be changing. In Feb 2026, [[BYD]], [[Geely]], and [[VinFast]] emerged as finalists to acquire the 230K-unit [[COMPAS Mexico plant sale 2026|COMPAS plant]] in Aguascalientes from [[Nissan]]-[[Mercedes-Benz]]. Economy ministry quietly stalling Chinese automaker investments pending US trade talks, but Mexico can't legally block a private factory sale. Chinese auto brands have gone from 0% to ~10% of Mexico's ~1.5M annual car market since 2020.

## MXN dynamics

**Why strong in 2025:**
- Carry trade inflows (7% rate vs 3.75% Fed)
- USD weakness post-Fed pivot
- Nearshoring dollar conversion flows
- Tourism boom (record visitors)
- Sheinbaum perceived as business-friendly

**Risks:**
- Banxico rate cuts narrowing spread
- USMCA 2026 review
- Tariff threats from US
- BoJ normalization unwinding global carry trades

## Sheinbaum administration

President [[Claudia Sheinbaum]] (took office Oct 2024):

### Plan México

See [[Plan Mexico]] — flagship pro-investment program. As of Feb 2026, struggling to gain traction despite ~30 investment announcements and a 5.6T peso ($326B) spending plan.

### Other policies
- Extended tax benefits for export industries
- Border region incentives (north and south)

## Structural challenges

- **Rule of law / judicial reform:** 80% of business leaders cite rule of law as major obstacle to FDI. 2024 judicial reform deepened legal uncertainty — business leaders say Plan México fails to offset this
- **Budget deficit:** Legacy from [[AMLO]] administration constraining public investment. Spending room gapped, accelerating double-digit drops in public investment
- **Infrastructure:** 109 km highway per 100k people (vs 189 Argentina, 230 Uruguay). Development hubs proposed in areas lacking infrastructure and human capital
- **Energy:** Grid constraints, Pemex debt overhang
- **[[USMCA]] review:** Mandatory 6-year review approaching (Jul 2026). Trump privately musing about exiting the pact (Bloomberg, Feb 2026). [[Canada]]'s Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc + 370 business leaders visited Mexico City week of Feb 16 for talks. LeBlanc and Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard signed trade memorandum
