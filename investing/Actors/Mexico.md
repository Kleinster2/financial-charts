# Mexico

North America's manufacturing hub and emerging market with one of the world's most attractive carry trades.

## Investment case

Mexico sits at the intersection of three major themes:
1. **Nearshoring** — US-China decoupling driving manufacturing relocation
2. **Carry trade** — 325bp rate differential vs Fed (7% vs 3.75%)
3. **USMCA access** — ~80% of exports to US remain duty-free

The peso appreciated ~23% against USD in 2025 — largest gain since 1994.

## Economy

**GDP growth:**
- 2025: 0.3-1.0% (weak, constrained by fiscal consolidation and trade uncertainty)
- 2026: 1.1-1.5% (rebound expected as domestic policies ease)

**Inflation:** Moderating toward Banxico's 3% target, expected to reach it by mid-2026. Currently in 4% range.

**Unemployment:** 2.6% (Oct 2025) — tight labor market.

## Monetary policy (Banxico)

- Policy rate: 7% (Dec 2025), down from peak
- Expected to ease to ~6.5% by end of 2026
- 325bp spread over Fed funds supports peso carry trade
- Gradual easing cycle — more cautious than Fed

## Foreign direct investment

Record $41B FDI in first three quarters of 2025 (+15% YoY). Key stats:
- **Manufacturing:** 37% of total FDI (autos, electronics, medical devices)
- **New investment:** Tripled vs 2024 (16% of total vs 6% prior year)
- **Sources:** US (30%), Spain, Netherlands, Japan, Canada
- **2026 forecast:** $40-45B

Chinese investment notably cautious given US/Mexico scrutiny and tariff uncertainty.

## MXN dynamics

**Why strong in 2025:**
- Carry trade inflows (7% rate vs 3.75% Fed)
- USD weakness post-Fed pivot
- Nearshoring dollar conversion flows
- Tourism boom (record visitors)
- Sheinbaum perceived as business-friendly

**Risks:**
- Banxico rate cuts narrowing spread
- USMCA 2026 review
- Tariff threats from US
- BoJ normalization unwinding global carry trades

## Sheinbaum administration

President Claudia Sheinbaum (took office Oct 2024):
- **Plan Mexico** — industrial policy focused on import substitution, reducing Chinese inputs
- Extended tax benefits for export industries
- Border region incentives (north and south)
- Generally viewed as pro-growth, market-friendly

## Structural challenges

- **Rule of law:** 80% of business leaders cite as major obstacle to FDI
- **Infrastructure:** 109 km highway per 100k people (vs 189 Argentina, 230 Uruguay)
- **Energy:** Grid constraints, Pemex debt overhang
