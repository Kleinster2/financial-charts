## Relationship to Khamenei family

| Person | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [[Ali Khamenei]] | Controls SETAD directly |
| [[Mojtaba Khamenei]] | Son; separate offshore empire |

SETAD is domestic; [[Mojtaba Khamenei]]'s offshore network is separate and more modest. The offshore assets may function as insurance if family needed to leave Iran.

## Sanctions

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| US | Sanctioned (entity and subsidiaries) |
| EU | Partially |
| UK | Partially |

Sanctions target SETAD for supporting Supreme Leader's office and human rights abuses.

## Why it matters

1. **Scale:** One of largest state-controlled entities in Middle East
2. **Opacity:** Zero transparency — unknown full holdings
3. **Contradiction:** Revolutionary regime built on seizure from "enemies" now resembles what it replaced
4. **Sanctions target:** Key node in Iranian elite wealth
5. **Succession stakes:** Control of SETAD is power
