# Q.ai

Israeli AI startup developing silent speech recognition technology. Acquired by [[Apple]] for ~$2B in January 2026 — Apple's second-largest acquisition ever after [[Beats]] ($3B, 2014).

## Technology

**Core capability:** Interprets speech from facial micro-movements without audible sound.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Silent speech | Understands mouthed/whispered words via facial analysis |
| Noisy environments | Works where traditional audio fails |
| Hardware target | Headphones, glasses, earbuds |

**How it works:** Uses imaging and machine learning to detect "facial skin micro-movements" — can reconstruct speech without any audio signal. Patents show integration with wearables for non-verbal device interaction.

## Strategic value to Apple

**Siri upgrade path:**
- Non-verbal commands through AirPods or Vision Pro
- Works in meetings, libraries, public spaces
- Differentiated approach vs pure LLM competitors

**[[Aviad Maizels]] track record:** PrimeSense acquisition led to Face ID — one of iPhone's defining features. Apple is betting on similar transformation.
