## Background

**Early career:** Joined National Instruments after graduation (2003). Worked on data collection, signal processing, instrument testing, and system integration.

**Robotics roots:** Member of Shanghai Jiao Tong's first robotics team. Competed in RoboCup Asia-Pacific 2002.

**First startup (2012-2015):** Founded Jinghe Robot, which developed Flexbot rehabilitation robot. Acquired by QJ Rehab in 2015.

**Fourier (2015-present):** After the acquisition, Gu wanted to continue building exoskeletons for people with physical disabilities. Named the company after mathematician Joseph Fourier (who laid the mathematical foundation for signal processing — fitting for a company that started in rehab robotics analyzing human motion signals).

## Path to humanoids

By 2019, Fourier had deployed rehab devices in hundreds of hospitals across 10+ countries. That year, Gu launched a humanoid robot initiative within Fourier.

**Philosophy:** "A shift from specialized-purpose robot to general robot is inevitable."

The expertise in human biomechanics, motor control, and safe human-robot interaction from rehabilitation robotics transferred directly to humanoid development — resulting in GR-1, GR-2, and GR-3 "care-bots."

## Political access
