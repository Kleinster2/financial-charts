**NuScale Power** — Small modular reactor (SMR) company. Only NRC-approved SMR design. High-risk bet.

---

## Why NuScale matters

SMR pure play:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | SMR |
| Market cap | ~$3B |
| Revenue | Minimal |
| Status | Pre-commercial |
| Milestone | NRC approval (2023) |

---

## Small Modular Reactors

**What are SMRs:**
- Smaller than traditional reactors
- Factory-built, modular
- 50-300 MW per module
- Faster deployment potential

---

## NuScale technology

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Power | 77 MW per module |
| Modules | Up to 12 per plant |
| Cooling | Passive (no pumps) |
| NRC certified | Yes (2023) |

Only NRC-approved SMR design.

## UAMPS project cancellation

**Setback (Nov 2023):**
- Utah project cancelled
- Cost overruns
- First commercial project gone
- Stock cratered

Major credibility hit.

---

## Recovery path

**Post-cancellation:**
- Pivoting to other customers
- International interest
- Data center opportunities
- DOE support continues

---

## AI data center opportunity

**SMRs for hyperscalers:**
- On-site power generation
- Modular scaling
- Zero carbon
- But: timeline long (2030s)

Hyperscalers interested but patient.

## Competition

| Company | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [[Oklo]] | Aurora microreactor |
| X-energy | Xe-100 design |
| TerraPower | Bill Gates backed |
| Kairos | Google partnership |

Crowded SMR field.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only NRC-approved SMR
- First mover advantage
- AI power demand thesis
- Government support

**Bear:**
- UAMPS cancellation
- No commercial revenue
- Long timelines (2030s)
- Execution risk high
- Competition growing

High risk/reward.
