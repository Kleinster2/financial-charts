## Venezuela opportunity

**If US companies rebuild Venezuela:**

- Infrastructure severely degraded since 2007
- Needs massive drilling/completion work
- Halliburton has historical Venezuela presence
- Could be multi-year revenue tailwind

**January 2026:** Trump announced US companies to invest billions in Venezuela oil. Services companies key beneficiaries.

**Market reaction (Jan 5, 2026):** HAL +10%+, leading oil services rally on Maduro capture news.
