## Career Arc

Mike Wilson is a [[Morgan Stanley]] lifer. He joined the firm in 1989 as an investment banker and spent over two decades working his way through the Institutional Equity Division (1995-2012), including roles as Head of Content Distribution for North American Equities.

In 2012, he was appointed CIO of Wealth Management, and later took on the broader role of Chief US Equity Strategist and Chair of the Global Investment Committee. He became one of the most-watched voices on [[Wall Street]], known for a methodical, sometimes contrarian approach to equity strategy.

Wilson's public profile peaked during 2022-2023, first as a vindicated bear, then as a cautionary tale about staying bearish too long.

## Key Theses & Frameworks

### Earnings-Driven Framework
Wilson's core approach centers on [[earnings estimates]] as the primary driver of equity prices. He tracks earnings revisions breadth, forward EPS estimates, and the gap between top-down macro signals and bottom-up analyst estimates. When he sees earnings risk, he gets bearish — sometimes too early.

### "Ice" vs "Fire" Scenarios
He's used the metaphor of "ice" (deflationary earnings recession) vs "fire" (inflationary overheating) to frame macro risks. In 2022-2023, he argued the market faced an earnings recession ("ice") that would bring the [[S&P 500]] significantly lower.

### Operating Leverage Squeeze
A key Wilson thesis: as revenue growth decelerates, companies with high operating leverage face margin compression that catches consensus off guard. This framework worked well in 2022 but failed to account for the [[AI]]-driven earnings resilience of [[Magnificent Seven|mega-cap tech]] in 2023-2024.

## Track Record

### Hits ✅
- Called the 2022 bear market — his S&P 500 target of ~3,900 was one of the most bearish and most accurate on the Street. The index bottomed near 3,577 in October 2022. He was named top strategist by multiple outlets.
- Margin compression call (2022) — correctly predicted earnings downgrades across cyclicals
- Warned about narrow market breadth — the concentration in mega-caps was a valid structural concern
- 2020 recovery call — was constructive coming out of the COVID crash

### Misses ❌
- Disastrously bearish through 2023 — maintained ~3,900 S&P target while the index rallied 24% to ~4,770. Kept calling for an earnings recession that never materialized. One of the worst major strategist calls of the year.
- Missed the [[AI]] trade entirely — his earnings pessimism blinded him to the transformative impact of [[ChatGPT]]/[[NVIDIA]] on tech earnings
- Stayed bearish into early 2024 — slow to capitulate even after the evidence was overwhelming
- Stepped back from Global Investment Committee in early 2024, with Lisa Shalett taking a larger role — widely seen as a consequence of the prolonged miss

### The 2023 Lesson
Wilson's 2023 miss is a case study in anchoring bias — his 2022 framework was correct, but he failed to update his priors when the earnings recession didn't materialize and [[AI]] capex created a new earnings cycle. The market rewarded the very stocks (tech, [[semiconductors]]) that his framework said were most at risk.
