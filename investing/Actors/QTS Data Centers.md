## Why QTS matters

**Scale.** QTS is the largest private data center platform, with capacity that has tripled since Blackstone acquisition. The $25B+ pipeline dwarfs public REIT competitors.

**Hyperscale focus.** Primary customers are hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and large enterprises needing wholesale capacity for AI workloads.

**Blackstone's AI infrastructure bet.** QTS is central to Blackstone's thesis that AI will drive unprecedented data center demand. The platform receives priority capital allocation.
