# Eurasia Group

Political risk research and consulting firm. The first company devoted exclusively to helping investors understand how politics affects markets.

## Overview

- **Founded:** 1998 by [[Ian Bremmer]]
- **HQ:** New York

Started with $25,000 in the offices of the World Policy Institute. Now has expert network spanning 90 countries.

## Business model

Sells political risk research to institutional investors, corporations, and financial advisors. Key partnerships:

Also runs **GZERO Media** (launched 2017), a digital media arm that publishes geopolitical analysis for general audiences. Includes newsletter, YouTube, podcast.

## Influence

Bremmer coined "G-Zero world" — the concept that no single power or bloc leads global affairs, creating a vacuum of leadership. Also created Wall Street's first Global Political Risk Index (GPRI).

Their annual "Top Risks" report (published each January) is widely followed. Identifies key geopolitical risks for the year ahead.

## Why it matters

When Eurasia Group analysts comment on policy moves — like Tim Puko on the US [[critical minerals]] stockpile — markets and policymakers pay attention. They're the go-to source for translating political events into investment implications.
