**ZhenFund (真格基金)** — Top Chinese early-stage VC, watching AI talent drain to US.

---

## Why it matters

ZhenFund represents Chinese VC perspective on AI brain drain. Their portfolio companies and talent are being acquired by US tech giants.

---

## On Manus/Meta deal

ZhenFund partner quoted on [[Meta]] acquiring Manus:

> "The era belonging to this generation of young Chinese entrepreneurs has arrived."

> "An incredible company and team are being sold to the United States. If [China] doesn't value them, someone else will."

**Translation:** Chinese VCs frustrated watching top AI talent/companies exit to US.

## The brain drain problem

| What's happening | Why it matters |
|------------------|----------------|
| Top Chinese AI founders selling to US | Talent leaving China |
| US acquirers paying premium | Capital advantage |
| Chinese VCs lose exits | Returns impaired |
| China loses AI capabilities | Strategic loss |

**Pattern:** Best Chinese AI startups → US acquisition → talent stays in US

---

## Strategic context

China's AI ecosystem losing:
- **Manus** → [[Meta]]
- **Top researchers** → US labs
- **Open-source contributors** → Western companies

Export controls cut off chips. Now talent is leaving too.
