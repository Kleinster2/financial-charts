# Farm Credit System

Nationwide cooperative network of borrower-owned lending institutions, created by the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. The largest single source of agricultural credit in the [[United States]], providing ~46% of all farm debt. Operates as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) — federally chartered but privately owned, with no federal appropriations or explicit government guarantee. Unlike [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], FCS was never placed in conservatorship and has been continuously borrower-owned since inception.

## Structure

### Four Funding Banks

| Bank | District | Associations Funded | Specialty |
|------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| [[AgriBank]] | Upper Midwest | 11 | Largest farm real estate portfolio |
| [[AgFirst Farm Credit Bank]] | East | 16 | Southeast and Mid-Atlantic |
| [[Farm Credit Bank of Texas]] | Southwest | 12 | Texas, Plains states |
| [[CoBank]] | Nationwide | 16 | Cooperatives, rural utilities, broadband, exports |

[[CoBank]] is structurally distinct — organized as an Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) with authority to lend directly to agricultural cooperatives, rural utility cooperatives, rural water/sewer systems, and to finance US agricultural exports. The other three banks primarily fund their affiliated retail associations.

### Associations (~55)

Retail lending arms that serve borrowers directly. Types include:
- Agricultural Credit Associations (ACAs): Short-, intermediate-, and long-term credit
- Federal Land Credit Associations (FLCAs): Real estate mortgage lending (tax-exempt)
- Production Credit Associations (PCAs): Short- and intermediate-term operating credit

Associations are owned by their borrowers, who purchase stock (lesser of $1,000 or 2% of loan amount) and become cooperative members. This cooperative structure drives patronage dividends that effectively lower borrowing costs by ~100-170 bps.

### Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation

Jointly owned by the four banks. Sole issuer of Systemwide Debt Securities — raises capital in debt markets and allocates proceeds to the banks, which then fund their associations. 34-member dealer selling group distributes debt to institutional investors. Headed by CEO Tracey McCabe.

### Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC)

Government-controlled entity that insures timely payment of principal and interest on Systemwide Debt Securities. Insurance Fund held $1.313B as of Dec 2024, targeting 2% of insured obligations. Has never been drawn upon to pay principal or interest. Funded by premiums assessed on the banks.

## How It Differs from USDA Lending

| Attribute | Farm Credit System | [[USDA]] Farm Service Agency (FSA) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Type | Cooperative GSE | Federal government agency |
| Funding | Capital markets (debt securities) | Congressional appropriations |
| Deposits | None — wholesale funded | N/A |
| Role | Primary agricultural lender | Lender of last resort |
| Market share | ~46% of farm debt | <4% of farm debt |
| Target | Creditworthy farmers, ranchers, cooperatives | Beginning farmers, underserved, those unable to get commercial credit |
| Duration | Permanent credit relationship | Temporary — goal is graduation to commercial credit |
| Tax status | Exempt from federal/state/local income tax | Government entity |

FSA serves as a safety net for borrowers who cannot qualify with FCS, commercial banks, or other conventional lenders. FCS is the dominant primary market lender.

## Funding Mechanism: Systemwide Debt Securities

All FCS loanable funds originate from Systemwide Debt Securities sold to investors on the open market. Three types:

### Discount Notes
- Short-term instruments issued at discount to par (similar to T-bills)
- Issued daily, wide range of maturities
- No periodic interest payments — return comes from discount
- Primary money market instrument

### Fixed Rate Bonds (Consolidated Systemwide Bonds)
- Maturities from 3 months to 30 years
- Callable or non-callable
- No maximum aggregate principal outstanding
- Designated Bonds: Larger, benchmark-size issues with enhanced liquidity — viable alternative to comparable Treasuries

### Medium-Term Notes
- Program exists but currently inactive — no new issuance under the 1993 offering circular

### Key Features
- Joint and several obligations of all four FCS banks
- Not obligations of, and not guaranteed by, the US government — implied but not explicit backing
- FCSIC-insured to extent of Insurance Fund ($1.3B vs ~$420B outstanding — coverage is limited)
- State and local tax exempt — interest income exempt from state/local tax (same as FHLB, TVA bonds)
- Agency status: Classified as "agency bonds" by the market alongside FHLB, Fannie, Freddie — eligible for same regulatory treatment by bank investors
- Offering circular updated annually (current: Dec 4, 2024 edition)

## Investability: Agency Bonds for Institutional Portfolios

Farm Credit bonds are a core holding for institutional fixed income investors:

### Credit Ratings (as of 2025)

| Agency | Long-Term | Short-Term | Outlook |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Fitch | AA+ | F1+ | Stable |
| Moody's | Aa1 | P-1 | Stable |
| S&P | AA+ | A-1+ | Stable |

All three ratings mirror the US sovereign — FCS was downgraded with the US (Fitch Aug 2023 from AAA, Moody's May 2025 from Aaa). No standalone FCS credit deterioration drove these actions.

### Spreads to Treasuries
- Agency bonds average ~13-25 bps over Treasuries (Bloomberg US Agency Index, late 2024)
- Spread varies by maturity — more yield pickup at very short (<1 year) and longer (>5 year) maturities
- 2-4 year maturities often trade near flat to Treasuries
- Designated Bonds offer tighter spreads due to benchmark liquidity

### Investor Base
- Commercial banks (significant holders for regulatory capital purposes)
- State and municipal treasuries
- Pension funds
- Insurance companies
- Money market funds (discount notes)
- Central banks and sovereign wealth funds

### Advantages over Treasuries
- Marginally higher yield for similar credit profile
- State/local tax exemption (valuable for investors in high-tax states)
- Diversification within government-adjacent credit
- Liquidity — Designated Bonds approach Treasury liquidity

### Liquidity
- System banks maintain 183 days of liquidity (Sep 2025)
- Daily discount note issuance ensures continuous market access
- Selling group of 34 dealers provides broad distribution

## Market Position

### Agricultural Lending Market Share

| Lender | Share of Total Farm Debt (2023) | RE Lending | Non-RE Lending |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------|----------------|
| Farm Credit System | 45.8% | ~50% | ~39% |
| Commercial banks (all) | 34.9% | ~32% | ~42% |
| Life insurance companies | ~7% | ~7% | Minimal |
| USDA FSA | <4% | <4% | Minimal |
| Farmer Mac | ~3% | ~3% | Minimal |
| Individuals/other | ~5% | ~5% | Minimal |

FCS dominates real estate lending (half of all farm RE loans). Commercial banks hold a slight edge in non-real estate operating credit (42% vs 39%), though FCS has been gaining share steadily since the late 1980s.

### Year-End 2024 Loan Balances

| Category | FCS | Agricultural Community Banks |
|----------|-----|------------------------------|
| Real estate farm loans | $188.0B | $46.5B |
| Non-real estate farm loans | $81.2B | $36.3B |

FCS holds 4x the real estate loan volume and 2.2x the operating loan volume of agricultural community banks.

### Loan Growth
- 7.7% YoY loan growth in 2024
- 2.1% additional growth through Sep 2025
- Growth driven by real estate mortgage, power/energy, and production/intermediate-term lending
- Partially offset by declining loans to cooperatives

## 2024 Financial Results

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2023 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Net income | $7.80B | $7.45B | +4.7% |

| Retained earnings | $61.4B | $57.6B | +$3.8B |
| Q4 net income | $1.89B | $1.94B | -2.6% |

### 2025 YTD (through Sep 30, 2025)

| Metric | 9M 2025 | 9M 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Net income | ~$5.9B (implied) | ~$5.8B | +1.0% |
| Net interest margin | 2.36% | 2.41% | -5 bps |
| Capital-to-assets | 15.0% | ~14.5% | +50 bps |
| Retained earnings | $65.6B | — | +$4.2B YTD |
| Nonperforming assets | $4.4B (1.00% of loans) | $3.5B (Dec 2024) | Rising |
| Allowance for credit losses | $2.2B | $1.8B (Dec 2024) | +22% |
| Net loan charge-offs | $407M (0.12% annualized) | $218M (9M 2024) | +87% |
| Provision for credit losses | $868M | $350M | +148% |

Credit quality deteriorating from pristine levels but remains manageable — 97.1% of loans rated Acceptable or OAEM (Sep 2025, down from 97.6% at Dec 2024).

## Rural Infrastructure: Beyond Agriculture

Through [[CoBank]] and certain associations, FCS finances critical rural infrastructure:

### Electric Cooperatives
CoBank serves 75%+ of rural electric co-ops nationwide with long-term debt and leasing. Rural electric cooperatives distribute power to areas commercial utilities often don't reach. This creates significant exposure to the [[Grid infrastructure super-cycle]] thesis — rural co-ops need massive investment in grid modernization, distributed generation, and EV charging infrastructure.

### Broadband and Communications
FCS finances rural local exchange carriers, cable companies, wireless providers, and data service entities. Rural broadband is a federal priority with billions in subsidies flowing through USDA and FCC programs — FCS provides the private co-lending that makes these projects viable.

### Water and Wastewater
Long-term financing for rural water districts and wastewater treatment facilities. Essential infrastructure that is chronically underfunded.

### Renewable Energy
Farm Credit Leasing (CoBank subsidiary) finances renewable energy equipment for utilities. Growing area as rural cooperatives add solar, wind, and battery storage.

### CoBank Financial Scale
- Average loan volume: $151.5B (2024)
- Net income: $1.635B (2024)
- Largest single FCS bank by assets
- Unique dual mandate: agricultural cooperatives AND rural infrastructure

## Political and Regulatory Environment

### Tax Exemption Controversy

The central ongoing political battle. FCS institutions and their income are exempt from federal, state, and local taxation (except real estate taxes). Their debt securities are exempt from all taxation as instrumentalities of the United States.

Commercial bank objections (led by [[ICBA]] and [[ABA]]):
- FCS has strayed from its original 1916 mission of serving bona fide farmers
- Tax-free real estate lending grew ~60% ($63B) between 2016-2022, more than 2x the rate of commercial bank growth
- FCS competes directly with private lenders using tax advantages no private institution can match
- ~4,000 commercial banks provide ag loans versus just 59 FCS institutions — yet FCS holds more total ag loans
- FCS has expanded into non-farm lending through "investment" activities that arguably exceed Farm Credit Act constraints

FCS defense:
- Created specifically to ensure reliable credit to underserved rural markets
- Cooperative structure returns earnings to farmer-borrowers as patronage (~$3B/year)
- Tax exemption is the mechanism that allows lower rates for farmers
- Without FCS, rural credit markets would face significant gaps

### Legislative Developments

ACRE Act (Access to Credit for our Rural Economy): Proposed to address competitive disparity — introduced in 118th Congress (H.R. 3139 / S. 2371).

ECORA Act (Enhancing Credit Opportunities in Rural America): Introduced 2021, aimed to lower farm real estate financing costs.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1, signed July 4, 2025): Created IRC Section 139L — allows qualified lenders (FDIC-insured banks, insurance companies) to exclude 25% of interest income on eligible rural/agricultural real estate loans from federal taxable income. Applies to loans originated after July 4, 2025. This was a partial victory for commercial banks seeking to level the playing field, though FCS retains its broader full tax exemption.

### Regulatory Environment

[[Farm Credit Administration]] board currently has two members (both serving expired terms) and one vacancy:
- Jeffery S. Hall — Chairman/CEO (designated by Trump, Jan 2025; board member since 2015)
- Glen R. Smith — Board member (since 2017)

FCA is self-funded through assessments on FCS institutions — not dependent on congressional appropriations, though Congress caps administrative expenses ($94.3M in FY2025). FCA has ~300 employees headquartered in McLean, VA.

March 2025: FCA issued a Statement on Regulatory Burden — signaling lighter-touch approach under new leadership.

### Consolidation Trend
FCS has consolidated steadily from hundreds of institutions to 59 today. The ABA has argued that continuing consolidation increases FCSIC bailout risk — fewer, larger institutions means each failure would be more systemically significant relative to the Insurance Fund ($1.3B backing ~$420B in debt).

## Risks

### Agricultural Downturn (Elevated — 2025-2026)

The agricultural economy is entering a stressed period:
- Operating profit margins collapsed: Crop farm average operating margin dropped from 25%+ (2021-22) to 7.5% (2023) to 1.8% (2024), expected to decline further in 2025
- Only 52% of farm borrowers expected to be profitable in 2025 (ABA/Farmer Mac survey)
- Commodity prices soft, input costs high, interest rates elevated
- 4-6% of crop farms were financially stressed in 2024 — could increase dramatically by end of 2026
- Livestock vs crop divergence: Strong cattle prices buffer some regions while crop-dependent areas deteriorate
- Farm debt expected to increase — 93% of ag lenders expect rising farm debt

### Farmland Value Concentration

FCS holds $188B in farm real estate loans, backed by farmland collateral. Farmland values remain 50%+ above 2020 and 165% above 2010 levels despite farm income stress. This creates risk if values correct:
- "Land values are the pressure valve. If they slip, lenders will tighten credit quickly" — Nebraska lender
- Farmland rose 0.8% in H2 2025 across Iowa/Nebraska/South Dakota/Wyoming — still positive but decelerating
- Tight land supply and financially strong buyers have sustained values so far
- A sustained crop price downturn that forces land sales could trigger a correction that impairs FCS collateral

### Political/Tax Risk

Loss or reduction of the tax exemption would fundamentally alter FCS economics. The July 2025 legislation (25% interest exclusion for commercial banks) shows Congress is willing to erode the FCS advantage incrementally. A future tax reform bill that fully leveled the playing field would compress FCS margins and potentially reduce patronage dividends.

### Credit Quality Deterioration

Already visible in 2025 data:
- Nonperforming assets up 26% to $4.4B (Sep 2025 vs Dec 2024)
- Provision for credit losses up 148% YoY ($868M vs $350M)
- Net charge-offs up 87% ($407M vs $218M)
- Acceptable/OAEM loans declining (97.1% vs 97.6%)

FCA notes that agriculture entered the downturn with "unprecedented levels of working capital" — providing a buffer. But sustained low crop prices through 2026 would erode that cushion.

### Sovereign Rating Linkage

FCS credit ratings are mechanically linked to US sovereign rating. All three agencies have now downgraded the US from AAA/Aaa. Further sovereign downgrades would automatically hit FCS funding costs, though the May 2025 Moody's downgrade had modest spread impact.

### Concentration and Insurance Adequacy

FCSIC's Insurance Fund ($1.3B) covers ~0.3% of outstanding insured debt (~$420B). If a major bank or multiple associations failed simultaneously, the fund would be insufficient. In that scenario, the remaining FCS banks would be called upon to absorb losses — creating systemic risk within the cooperative. The "joint and several" obligation structure means surviving banks backstop failed ones.

## Cooperative Returns (Patronage)

FCS associations return a portion of earnings to borrower-members as patronage dividends, effectively reducing the cost of borrowing:

| Association | 2024 Patronage | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Farm Credit Mid-America | $260M | Largest ever distribution |
| Farm Credit East | $140M | ~1.25% of eligible loan volume |
| Capital Farm Credit | Part of $2.9B cumulative since 2006 | — |
| AgTrust | $32.3M | — |
| Frontier Farm Credit | $26.1M | 21st consecutive year |
| System-wide | ~$3B+ estimated | — |

AgCredit's 5-year average patronage return: 20.46% of interest paid, reducing effective rates by ~167 bps. This is the core value proposition that differentiates FCS from commercial bank lending — borrowers effectively get a rebate on interest.

Since 2012, FCS has returned over $21 billion in patronage dividends to farmers and ranchers.
