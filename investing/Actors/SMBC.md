## Apollo partnership

[[Apollo]] CEO [[Marc Rowan]] cited SMBC as one of Apollo's key Japanese partnerships (Feb 2026). Apollo provides long-dated, investment-grade private credit to supplement what banks like SMBC do — not competing on advisory, hedging, derivatives, or M&A, but filling a capital gap that banks face due to regulatory capital constraints.
