## Key themes

| Theme | Sandbu view |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fed under political pressure** | Warsh inherits a job fundamentally changed—sustained pressure tilts mandate toward growth/employment over inflation |
| **Global public goods at risk** | Fed's role providing swap lines and regulating global banks may be curtailed under Warsh |
| **Greenspan put tension** | Warsh's "tough love" instinct vs Trump's expectation of market bailouts is the real challenge |

## On Warsh Fed (Jan 2026)

Sandbu's analysis (Jan 31, 2026) identifies three structural shifts:

1. **Political pressure changes the job** — Regardless of Warsh's orthodox views, the Fed Chair position now faces sustained political pressure not seen for decades. This tilts policy toward growth/employment.

2. **Global firefighting capacity reduced** — Warsh likely finds it harder to:
   - Maintain swap lines (global dollar liquidity)
   - Regulate global banks responsibly
   - His tolerance for "market self-correction" compounds this

3. **Domestic crisis tension** — The real test isn't monetary policy but how Warsh handles market turmoil. His "tough love" instinct clashes with Trump's expectation of a "turbocharged [[Greenspan put]]."

> "That tension, rather than monetary policy, may be the real challenge Warsh will sooner or later have to face."
