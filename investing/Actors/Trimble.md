## Why Trimble matters

Software for the physical world — construction, agriculture, transportation, geospatial:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | TRMB (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$16B |
| Revenue (2025) | $3.59B |
| Net income (2025) | $424M |
| Revenue guidance (2026) | $3.81–3.91B |
| ARR growth target | 12–14% organic (FY2026) |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| Buildings & Infrastructure | Construction modeling, project management |
| Geospatial | Surveying, mapping, GIS |
| Resources & Utilities | Agriculture, utilities |
| Transportation | Fleet management, logistics |

---

## AI strategy

AI-powered solutions driving productivity gains in construction and field operations. Incremental ARR from AI features. Data infrastructure construction boom (AI data centers) is a direct demand tailwind — Trimble tools used in building the physical infrastructure for AI.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Recurring software transition (higher margins, predictable revenue)
- AI data center construction tailwind
- Dominant in construction/geospatial niche
- 12–14% organic ARR growth

**Bear:**
- Macro sensitivity (construction cycles)
- Execution risk on software transition
- Smaller scale vs enterprise software peers
- Forward P/E 18.6x with modest 7.6% sales growth

## Zacks top AI stock (Feb 2026)

Ranked #5 on Zacks "Best AI Stocks to Buy" list (updated Feb 16, 2026):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $66.91 |
| Forward P/E | 18.58 |
| 12-week price change | -18.8% |
| Proj EPS growth (1Y) | +12.8% |
| Proj sales growth (1Y) | +7.6% |

Cheapest P/E after [[Micron]] but slowest growth. Non-obvious AI pick — builds the physical world where AI lives.

**Zacks detail:** Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Value D, Growth F, Momentum B. Market cap $15.8B. Last Q EPS growth +25.7%, last EPS surprise +4.2%. Next earnings: **May 6, 2026**. "Connect and scale" strategy linking design, construction, and operations into unified workflows via subscriptions. AI-based tools: autonomous procurement, autonomous quotation. Improving price action as investors discount AI-driven workflow adoption across construction and logistics.
