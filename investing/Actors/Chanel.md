# Chanel

**World's largest privately held luxury house** — owned by the Wertheimer family (grandsons of Pierre Wertheimer). Iconic brand in fashion, fragrance, watches, beauty. Revenue peaked ~$20B in 2023 before China-driven decline in 2024. Known for aggressive price increases (59% between 2020-2023) that may have overshot.

## Why Chanel matters

**The ultimate private luxury brand.** Unlike LVMH or Kering, Chanel answers to no public shareholders. This enables:
- Long-term creative decisions without quarterly pressure
- Aggressive capex ($1.8B in 2024, $600M in manufacturing alone)
- Ability to raise prices without investor backlash
- $5.7B family dividend in good years

**But 2024 exposed the limits:** Revenue fell 4.3% and operating profit dropped ~30%. The 59% price increases of 2020-2023 (highest among peers per Bernstein) alienated aspirational buyers while China's luxury slowdown hit hard.

## Pricing strategy

| Period | Price increase | Result |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 2020-2023 | **+59%** (highest in luxury) | Revenue surge, then backlash |
| 2025+ | In line with inflation | Reset, slower growth |

**Classic Flap bag:** From ~$5,800 (2020) to ~$10,800 (2024) — near-doubling drove short-term revenue but long-term brand risk. Chanel is now moderating to inflation-level increases.

## Key product categories

| Category | Position |
|----------|----------|
| **Fashion** | Haute couture + ready-to-wear |
| **Fragrance** | Chanel No. 5, Bleu de Chanel — iconic |
| **Beauty** | Significant revenue contributor |
| **Watches & Jewelry** | J12 watch, high jewelry |
| **Leather goods** | Classic Flap, Boy, 2.55 bags |

## 2024-2025 challenges

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **China slowdown** | ~25-30% exposure, demand falling |
| **Price fatigue** | 59% hikes drove customers away |
| **Creative transition** | Virginie Viard out, Matthieu Blazy in (from Bottega Veneta) |
| **Operating profit -30%** | Heavy investment cycle + declining revenue |
| **Hiring freeze** | Maintaining 38,400 headcount flat |

---

## Investment & strategy

Chanel is spending through the downturn:
- **$1.8B capex** (2024), guided flat for 2025
- **$600M manufacturing** — expanding ateliers, vertical integration
- **Acquisition spree** — bought watchmaking, jewelry, textile suppliers
- **Flagship stores** — major renovations globally

**Matthieu Blazy hire:** Former Bottega Veneta creative director (drove its +93% growth era). Debuts at Chanel expected 2025 — the most anticipated creative appointment in luxury.
