## Q3 FY2026 (holiday quarter)

| Metric | Actual | Estimate | Result |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Sales growth (CC) | **+11%** | +7.5% | Beat |

## Regional performance

| Region | Growth | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Americas** | Strong | US demand robust |
| **Japan** | **+17%** | Outperformer |
| **Europe** | Solid | Middle East tourists |

## Brands portfolio

| Division | Brands |
|----------|--------|
| **Jewelry Maisons** | Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati |
| **Specialist Watchmakers** | IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, Panerai |
| **Other** | Montblanc, [[Chloé]], Dunhill, Alaïa |

Cartier = crown jewel (~50% of revenue). Jewelry = 72% of total sales.

**The fashion problem:** The "Other" segment (Chloé, Alaïa, dunhill) consistently loses money — **-€102M operating loss** in FY25. Jewelry subsidizes fashion.

## Cartier momentum

**Celebrity effect:**
- Taylor Swift wearing Cartier
- Timothée Chalamet boosting visibility
- Jewelry as "store of value" narrative

**Jean-Philippe Bertschy (Vontobel):**
> "Richemont sustained its growth trajectory and reinforced its leadership in the luxury sector."
