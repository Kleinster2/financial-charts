## Competitive position

| Company | Valuation | Region | Focus |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| [[Anduril]] | $30.5B | US | Full-stack autonomous |
| **Helsing** | **$13.2B** | **Europe** | **AI + drones + autonomous vehicles** |
| [[Shield AI]] | $5.3B | US | Autonomous aircraft |
| [[Palantir]] | Public (~$200B) | US | Defense data/AI |

**vs Anduril:** Same thesis (AI-powered autonomous warfare) but European sovereignty angle. Less hardware-focused initially, now building own manufacturing with [[Grob]] acquisition.

## Bull case

- Europe's defense spending inflection (NATO 5% by 2035)
- Only credible European Anduril equivalent
- Daniel Ek's full attention post-Spotify (Jan 2026)
- Ukraine validates autonomous weapons in combat
- Manufacturing capability (Grob + first factory)
- Satellite expansion (Kongsberg partnership)
- Valuation doubled in <12 months

## Bear case

- Revenue likely still small vs valuation
- European defense procurement is slow/political
- Regulatory complexity (multiple governments)
- Manufacturing scale unproven
- Competition from US primes expanding into Europe
- Private — limited visibility
