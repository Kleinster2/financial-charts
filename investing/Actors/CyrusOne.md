## Why CyrusOne matters

**Texas dominance.** CyrusOne has the largest concentration of data centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth market — 14+ facilities, both operational and planned. Texas offers low power costs, no state income tax, and available land.

**KKR infrastructure play.** Part of KKR's broader bet on digital infrastructure. KKR and Energy Capital Partners announced a $50B strategic partnership for AI infrastructure, with CyrusOne as a key platform.

**Enterprise + hyperscale.** Serves both traditional enterprise customers and hyperscalers, providing diversification vs pure-play hyperscale platforms.

GIP was acquired by [[BlackRock]] in October 2024 — so BlackRock now has indirect exposure to CyrusOne.
