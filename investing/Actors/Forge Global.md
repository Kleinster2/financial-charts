## History

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2014 | Founded as Equidate Inc. by Prasad, Ramadurgam, Andrea Lamari, Gil Silberman. YC alumni. Early backing from [[Peter Thiel]], Tim Draper |
| 2018 | Kelly Rodriques hired as CEO |
| Jan 2019 | Rebranded from Equidate to Forge Global. Series B increased to $85M. Crossed $1B cumulative volume |
| May 2020 | Acquired SharesPost for $160M (cash + stock). FINRA approval for single broker-dealer |
| Nov 2020 | Closed $150M+ oversubscribed round |
| May 2021 | Deutsche Borse, [[Temasek]], Wells Fargo Strategic Capital round. Total funding exceeded $250M |
| Sep 2021 | $2B SPAC merger announced with Motive Capital Corp (MOTV.U) |
| Mar 2022 | SPAC closed. NYSE listing as FRGE. Stock briefly hit $712 intraday (pre-split) |
| 2022-2023 | Revenue collapsed from $128M to $69M. Stock fell >95% |

## Schwab acquisition

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquirer | [[Charles Schwab]] |
| Price | $45/share (all cash) |
| Deal value | ~$660M |
| Board approval | Unanimous (both boards) |
| Stockholder vote | Jan 22, 2026 (69.8% in favor) |
| Key supporters | Motive Capital, Deutsche Borse (two largest shareholders) |
| Expected close | H1 2026, pending regulatory approvals |

Strategic rationale: Schwab has 46M client accounts and $11.6T in client assets. Private wealth capital in alternatives expected to grow from $4T to $13T by 2032. Plans to offer Forge to ultra-high-net-worth clients first, then expand down-market.

$660M represents a significant discount from the $2B SPAC valuation 3.5 years earlier.

## Financials

| Metric | FY 2021 | FY 2022 | FY 2023 | FY 2024 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $128.1M | $69.4M | $69.8M | $79.3M |
| YoY | -- | -45.8% | +0.6% | +13.6% |
| Net loss | -- | -$111.9M | -$91.5M | -$67.8M |

2021 was an outlier driven by SPAC/IPO boom in private markets. Revenue collapsed 2022-2023 with tech drawdown. Cumulative net losses >$270M over 2022-2024. Never profitable as a public company.

### FY 2024 revenue breakdown

| Segment | Revenue | YoY |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Marketplace (net) | $37.0M | +46% |
| Custodial admin fees (net) | $41.7M | -5% |
| Trading volume | $1.3B | +73% |
| Net take rate | 2.8% | (vs 3.3% in 2023) |

### 2025 quarterly

| Quarter | Revenue | Key metric |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Q1 2025 | $25.1M (+37% QoQ) | Best quarter as public co |
| Q2 2025 | $27.6M (+10% QoQ) | Trading volume $756M (+77% YoY) |
| Q3 2025 | $21.3M (+10.6% YoY) | |

## Competitors

| Competitor | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Nasdaq Private Market | Backed by SVB, Citi, Goldman, Morgan Stanley |
| EquityZen | Acquired by [[Morgan Stanley]] (late 2025) |
| Hiive | $650M valuation, comparable volume to Forge |
| Linqto | Mobile-first, accredited investors |

Morgan Stanley acquired EquityZen around the same time Schwab acquired Forge -- major wirehouses racing to own private market infrastructure.

## Investment case

Effectively an arb play on Schwab deal closing:
- Stock trading at ~$45, deal at $45/share
- Stockholders already approved (Jan 2026)
- Minimal spread = market confident in close
- Downside risk if deal blocked (antitrust unlikely)
