## What makes S&P Global, S&P Global

**The ratings moat:**
S&P Ratings is one of three major credit rating agencies (with Moody's and Fitch). Issuers *must* get rated to access bond markets. 62% operating margins reflect pricing power.

**Index licensing:**
S&P 500 is the benchmark. Every ETF tracking it pays licensing fees. High-margin, recurring revenue.

**Data network effects:**
Capital IQ data feeds into ratings analysis, which feeds into index construction. Cross-selling across segments.
