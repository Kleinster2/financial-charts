## Business model

**Hybrid digital + physical bank** — combines a full digital banking platform with asset-light "Smart Hubs" (paperless, cashless advisory locations) that serve as gateways for less digitally native customers. Targets [[Brazil]]'s underserved mass segment — estimated 107M individuals, R$1.9T addressable market.

| Product | Description | Mix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Consignado (payroll loans)** | Core product, INSS + private sector | ~80% of credit portfolio |
| **Cartão consignado** | Credit cards with payroll-deducted payment | Growing |
| **FGTS credit** | Loans backed by FGTS anniversary withdrawals | Supplementary |
| **Personal credit** | Unsecured lending to account holders | Smaller |
| **Insurance** | Life insurance cross-sell | Emerging |
| **Banking** | Checking, debit, payments, investments | Distribution |

**Key advantage:** Only neobank accredited by [[INSS]] to accept social security and government benefit deposits. This requires a banking license, physical presence, and personal advisory — barriers that purely digital competitors like [[Nubank]] cannot easily replicate.

**Distribution:** All loan origination through proprietary channels (Smart Hubs + digital). No third-party distribution.

**INSS consignado market share:** 3% (end 2022) → 4.7% (2023) → 6.4% (Dec 2024). Management targeting 10%. Total INSS consignado market: ~R$700B outstanding stock, growing ~8%/year.

## Financials

| Revenue | R$5.1B | R$7.5B (+46%) | — |
| Net income | R$430M | R$871M (+103%) | R$652M (+48% YoY) |
| Credit portfolio | R$15.8B | R$24.0B (+52%) | R$30.1B (+58%) |

| NPS | — | 76 | 73 |
| ROAE | — | ~47% | 43.9% |

**Growth trajectory is strong** — revenue nearly tripled and net income doubled YoY in FY 2024. Credit quality improving (90+ day delinquency falling from 3.9% to 2.8%) as the portfolio shifts toward secured consignado lending.

## IPO (February 2026)

| Detail | Original plan | Actual |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Shares offered | 43.6M | 20M |
| Price range | $15-18 | $12 (low of revised $12-13) |
| Gross proceeds | ~$785M | $240M ($276M w/ greenshoe) |
| Implied market cap | ~$3.0-3.3B | ~$1.9B |
| Exchange | NYSE | NYSE |
| Ticker | AGBK | AGBK |
| First trading day | Feb 11, 2026 | Feb 11, 2026 |
| Opening price | — | $11.00 (-8.3% from IPO) |

**Underwriters:**
- Active global coordinators: [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]]
- Passive global coordinator: [[Citigroup]]
- Passive bookrunners: [[Bradesco BBI]], [[BTG Pactual]], [[Itaú BBA]], [[Santander]], [[Société Générale]], [[XP]]

**Why the IPO was slashed >50%:**

1. **[[PicPay]] contagion** — ~20% post-IPO decline set negative precedent for Brazilian fintech
2. **INSS regulatory overhang** — Dec 2025 suspension over post-death contracts and data manipulation
3. **Valuation gap** — original $3B+ target was nearly 2x the last private round (R$9.3B / ~$1.7B)
4. **Broader fintech skepticism** — mixed aftermarket performance across recent listings

All shares sold were primary — existing shareholders chose to retain rather than sell at reduced valuation. This creates potential stock overhang risk.

## INSS regulatory issues

Two suspensions in 2025 raised governance concerns:

**August 2025:** INSS suspended Agibank for diverting calls from INSS's 135 call center to the bank's app, portability refusals, and improper fund withholding. Resolved Nov 2025 via commitment agreement.

**December 2, 2025:** Indefinite suspension after CGU (Comptroller General) audit found:
- 1,192 payroll loan agreements signed **after death** of beneficiaries (2023-2025)
- 30,000+ contracts with interest rates below 1%/month (far below permitted ceiling, suggesting data manipulation)
- Fraudulent refinancing — multiple contracts grouped into single refinancing, some nonexistent in INSS systems

**Resolution (January 12, 2026):** Suspension lifted. Agibank agreed to enhanced oversight, R$1M compensatory payment, and specific process adjustments. Matter also referred to Federal Police.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Customers | Model | Agibank difference |
|------------|-----------|-------|--------------------|
| [[Nubank]] | 100M+ | Digital-only, mass market | Agibank has physical Smart Hubs, INSS accreditation |
| [[PicPay]] | 67M | Super-app, credit pivot | Agibank more secured lending, less digital-native |
| [[PagSeguro]] | 30M+ | SMB payments + banking | Different segments — PagSeguro is merchant-focused |
| [[StoneCo]] | 4.7M | SMB payments + credit | StoneCo is B2B; Agibank is consumer |

**Key risk:** Earnings depend heavily on lending spreads and cross-selling, making Agibank more rate-sensitive than peers like [[Nubank]] that built on deposits and fee income first. The 15% [[Selic]] environment is both opportunity (wide spreads on consignado) and risk (credit quality pressure on unsecured book).
