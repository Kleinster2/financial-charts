*Geographic deal distribution: ADIA (pink) writes bigger checks, fewer deals, dominates India. [[Mubadala]] (red) most global. [[ADQ]] (orange) local-focused. (Bloomberg, Dec 2025)*

| Fund | Deals | Style |
|------|-------|-------|

| [[Mubadala]] | 330+ | Most active, US/Europe focused |
| [[ADQ]] | 280+ | Local/regional, fastest-growing |

**India focus:** ADIA accounts for lion's share of Abu Dhabi's India deals — strategic given UAE-India trade ties.
