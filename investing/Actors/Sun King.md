## Business model

**Distributed solar kits on pay-as-you-go basis:**
- Small panels + battery storage
- Affordable financing for households
- Direct-to-consumer distribution

**Wale Aboyade (VP Public Affairs):** "The fact that most of this capacity comes from distributed systems means its impact is far more widespread than in countries like South [[Africa]], where large utility-scale plants dominate. In Nigeria, solar is reaching hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses directly."
