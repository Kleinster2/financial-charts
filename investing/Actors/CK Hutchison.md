## Panama Canal ports crisis (2025-2026)

This is the hottest geopolitical story around CK Hutchison right now — a US-China proxy battle.

**Timeline:**
- **1997:** Panama Ports Co. (CKH subsidiary) began operating Balboa and Cristóbal ports at both ends of the Panama Canal
- **2021:** Concession renewed for 25 years
- **2025:** Trump alleges China is "running the Panama Canal" — political pressure mounts
- **Mar 2025:** CKH negotiates $23B deal to sell non-China port assets to [[BlackRock]]-led consortium (with [[MSC]]/TiL)
- **2025:** Beijing intervenes, calls sale "kowtowing" to American pressure — transaction stalled
- **Jan 30, 2026:** Panama Supreme Court rules concession "unconstitutional"
- **Feb 2026:** Panama taps [[A.P. Moller-Maersk]] (APM Terminals) to temporarily take over port operations
- **Feb 12, 2026:** CKH threatens legal action against Maersk, files arbitration + investment protection treaty dispute against Panama
- **Feb 2026:** Beijing warns Panama "will inevitably pay a heavy price" — directs state firms to halt new Panama projects, considers rerouting cargo

**Key dynamics:**
- CKH is caught between Washington and Beijing — can't sell (Beijing blocks), can't keep (Panama revokes)
- [[BlackRock]] deal in limbo — $23B for 43 ports excluding China assets
- China using CKH situation to prevent "precedent" that could threaten [[COSCO]]'s Chancay port in Peru
- US has treaty leverage with Panama on national security grounds

## Telco spinoff potential

Reuters (Jan 20, 2026): CKH weighing London and Hong Kong listing of global telecom business as early as Q3 2026.

Key telco assets:
- **VodafoneThree** (UK) — 49% stake, merged Vodafone UK + Three UK
- **Wind Tre** (Italy) — 100%
- **3 Danmark/Sverige** (Nordics)
- **Drei Austria**, **Three Ireland**
- **Hutchison Asia Telecom** — Indonesia (via Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison), Vietnam, Sri Lanka
- **TPG Telecom** (Australia) — 25% effective interest

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Deep discount conglomerate — parts worth more than the whole
- Telco spinoff could unlock significant value
- Port sale ($23B) if Beijing relents
- Infrastructure assets (CKI) are high-quality regulated utilities
- A.S. Watson is a global retail franchise

**Bear:**
- Geopolitical pawn — caught between US and China with no clean exit
- Panama port loss = direct asset destruction
- Beijing can block any strategic moves (demonstrated with BlackRock deal)
- Conglomerate discount persistent in Hong Kong
- Li Ka-shing family governance / succession questions
