ChangXin Memory Technologies ([[CXMT]]) — [[China]]'s leading DRAM manufacturer, headquartered in Hefei. First Chinese company to mass-produce advanced mobile DRAM (Jan 2026). State-backed national champion, mulling IPO at ~$40B valuation. Now hitting capacity ceiling due to [[Export controls]] on semiconductor equipment.

## Capacity plateau (Feb 2026)

Per Omdia data (reported by Chosun Biz, Feb 12, 2026):

CXMT has hit its **peak production capacity** at ~240K wafers/month as of Q4 2025. After roughly doubling output in 2025, capacity is expected to plateau throughout 2026.

| Company | Annual DRAM capacity (2025) | vs CXMT |
|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| [[Samsung]] | ~7.6M wafers | 2.6x CXMT |
| [[SK Hynix]] | ~5.97M wafers | 2.1x CXMT |
| [[Micron]] | ~3.6M wafers | 1.2x CXMT |
| **CXMT** | **~2.9M wafers** | — |

**Why the ceiling:** US [[export controls]] are cutting off access to advanced semiconductor equipment. CXMT cannot buy from [[ASML]], [[Lam Research]], [[Applied Materials]], [[KLA]], or [[Tokyo Electron]].

**Path forward:** China's Phase 3 IC investment fund is being concentrated on domestic semiconductor equipment. If equipment localization succeeds, capacity expansion could resume from **2027**, including CXMT's new Shanghai fab.

LS Securities analyst Cha Yong-ho: "The tightening of U.S. export controls is limiting CXMT's capacity expansion. China is aware of this, and its Phase 3 investment fund is being concentrated on semiconductor equipment."

## Yield gap — the real bottleneck

Despite impressive capacity numbers, actual output is much lower due to yield problems:

| Metric | CXMT | Samsung/SK Hynix |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Process node | 1x-nm (1st gen 10nm) | 1a-nm (4th gen 10nm) |
| Yield rate | ~50% | 92%+ (mature node) |
| Yield gap | **42% lower** than Big Three on comparable mature nodes |

Nameplate capacity of 240K wafers/month is misleading — at ~50% yield, effective good-die output is roughly half. Actual shipment market share is even lower than capacity share suggests.

**Industry source:** "Unlike NAND flash, DRAM involves far greater design and process complexity, so it will take CXMT considerable time to introduce advanced processes on par with Samsung Electronics or SK hynix."

## Samsung IP leak (Dec 2025)

A Samsung engineer leaked 600+ process steps via handwritten notes — specific gas ratios, reactor pressures, photoresist parameters. Represents 5 years and 1.6T KRW of Samsung R&D.

This gives CXMT the ability to calibrate directly using Samsung's PRP process roadmap, potentially accelerating yield improvement. Demonstrates that [[export controls]] can restrict hardware but not knowledge transfer.

## Mobile DRAM breakthrough (Jan 2026)

First Chinese company to begin mass-producing advanced mobile DRAM for smartphones and mobile devices — a market previously dominated entirely by Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron.

## EUV barrier

As DRAM processes advance into the low 10nm range, [[ASML]] EUV lithography becomes essential. US restrictions make it impossible for CXMT to acquire EUV systems. This is the hard ceiling — domestic equipment cannot substitute for EUV at advanced nodes.

**Potential CHIPS Act escalation:** US lawmakers (bipartisan) introduced a bill prohibiting CHIPS Act subsidy recipients from purchasing Chinese-made semiconductor equipment for 10 years — further isolating Chinese equipment ecosystem.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- National champion status (state backing, Phase 3 IC fund)
- Mobile DRAM milestone validates capability
- Massive domestic market (China smartphones)
- Samsung IP leak accelerates technology catch-up
- $40B IPO valuation anchors future listing
- Equipment localization could unlock 2027+ expansion

**Bear:**
- Equipment export controls create hard capacity ceiling
- 42% yield gap vs Big Three — actual output far below nameplate
- EUV barrier blocks advanced node progression
- 2+ generations behind Samsung/SK Hynix
- Further US restrictions likely (CHIPS Act equipment ban)
- Not yet listed (illiquid)
