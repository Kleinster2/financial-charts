**ChangXin Memory ([[CXMT]])** — [[China]]'s leading DRAM maker. First to mass-produce advanced mobile DRAM. Mulling IPO at ~$40B valuation.

## Why ChangXin Memory matters

[[China]]'s DRAM champion — now competing with Samsung, SK Hynix:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Hefei |
| Focus | DRAM (memory) |
| IPO valuation | ~300B yuan (**~$40B**) |
| IPO target | Onshore (mainland [[China]]) |
| Milestone | First Chinese mobile DRAM mass production |

## Mobile DRAM breakthrough (Jan 2026)

**First in [[China]]:**
- Began mass-producing advanced mobile DRAM
- For smartphones and mobile devices
- Field previously dominated by Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron

This is a significant milestone for [[China]] memory independence.

## IPO consideration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | 300B yuan (~$40B) |
| Exchange | Mainland [[China]] |
| Status | Mulling |

At $40B, would be one of largest [[China]] chip IPOs — comparable to [[YMTC]] ($40B+ also mulling).

## Competitive position

| vs | Status |
|----|--------|
| [[Samsung]] | Still behind on leading-edge |
| [[SK Hynix]] | Still behind on leading-edge |
| [[Micron]] | Still behind on leading-edge |
| [[YMTC]] | Different focus (DRAM vs NAND) |

**Key difference from YMTC:**
- [[CXMT]] = DRAM (volatile memory)
- YMTC = NAND (storage memory)

Both are national champions in their respective memory segments.

---

## Export control impact

**Equipment constraints:**
- Like YMTC, limited access to advanced tools
- Cannot buy from [[ASML]], [[Lam Research]], [[Applied Materials]]
- Forced to use domestic alternatives or stockpiled equipment

But mobile DRAM milestone shows continued progress despite restrictions.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- National champion status (state backing)
- Mobile DRAM breakthrough validates capability
- Massive domestic market ([[China]] smartphones)
- $40B valuation anchors future listing

**Bear:**
- Export controls limit technology access
- 2+ generations behind Samsung/SK Hynix
- Equipment constraints will persist
- Not yet listed (illiquid)
