**Tokyo Electron (TEL)** — #3 global WFE. Japanese semiconductor equipment leader. Coater/developer dominance.

---

## Why Tokyo Electron matters

TEL is the largest Japanese WFE company and #3 globally:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #3 WFE globally |
| Specialty | Coater/developer, etch, deposition |
| HQ | Tokyo, [[Japan]] |
| Market share | ~15% of WFE |

---

## Product portfolio

| Segment | Products | Market position |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Coater/Developer** | Lithography track | #1 globally |
| **Etch** | Plasma etch | #3 (behind Lam, Applied) |
| **Deposition** | CVD, ALD | Strong |
| **Cleaning** | Wet clean | Top tier |

**Coater/developer dominance:** Essential companion to [[ASML]] lithography. Near-monopoly.

---

## ASML symbiosis

**Coater/developer + lithography:**
- ASML does exposure
- TEL does coat (before) and develop (after)
- Every EUV scanner needs TEL track
- Deeply integrated workflow

**Implication:** TEL benefits from every ASML EUV sale.

---

## [[China]] exposure

**Export control impact:**
- TEL subject to [[Japan]] export controls
- Aligned with US restrictions
- Some [[China]] revenue at risk
- But mature-node tools still allowed

**[[Japan]] government stance:**
- Coordinated with US/Netherlands
- Restricted advanced equipment to [[China]]
- TEL compliant

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Segment | TEL vs |
|------------|---------|--------|
| [[ASML]] | Lithography | Partner, not competitor |
| [[Applied Materials]] | Deposition, etch | Competes |
| [[Lam Research]] | Etch | Competes |
| [[KLA]] | Inspection | Different segment |
| Screen | Cleaning | Competes |

TEL is diversified across WFE, less concentrated than peers.

---

## [[Japan]] ecosystem

**Part of [[Japan]] semiconductor revival:**
- [[Rapidus]] uses Japanese equipment
- Government supporting domestic WFE
- TEL = national champion

**Other [[Japan]] WFE:**
- Screen (cleaning)
- [[Advantest]] (test)
- [[Disco]] (dicing)
- Lasertec (inspection)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- #3 global WFE
- Coater/developer near-monopoly
- ASML EUV tailwind
- [[Japan]] semiconductor revival
- Memory recovery benefits

**Bear:**
- [[China]] exposure risk
- Yen volatility
- Cyclical WFE market
- Less leading-edge focus than ASML
