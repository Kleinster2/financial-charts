## Why it matters

Varda represents the convergence of **space, pharma, and defense** — three sectors that rarely overlap. The same reentry vehicle technology that returns drugs from orbit can also serve as a hypersonic weapons testbed. This dual-use nature makes it attractive to both commercial pharma customers and the Pentagon.

Part of the broader defense tech wave emanating from the [[Peter Thiel]]/[[Founders Fund]] network — alongside [[Anduril]], [[Palantir]], and Hadrian.
