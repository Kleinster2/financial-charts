## Advanced ceramics (semiconductor segment)

Electrostatic chucks for cryogenic etching tools used in [[3D NAND]] manufacturing:

- Ceramics remain stable at extremely low temperatures, clamping silicon wafers during precision etching
- As memory chips add more layers, cryogenic etching demand grows — Toto is a key supplier
- Division provides ~40-50% of Toto's operating profit (Register reports >50%; other sources say 40%)
- Technology roots: ceramic expertise from 100+ years of toilet manufacturing, applied to chucks since the 1980s
- Only recently became material to financials as 3D NAND layering intensified

## Palliser Capital activist campaign (Feb 2026)

[[Palliser Capital]] sent letter to Toto's board calling for more disclosure of the advanced ceramics segment:

- Invested ~6 months ago, now top 20 shareholder
- Thesis: ¥554B ($3.6B) valuation disconnect. 55%+ upside from disclosure, capital allocation, operational efficiency
- Estimates 5-year sustainable competitive advantage before rivals can catch up
- Projected 30%+ revenue growth over two years from memory chip upgrade cycle + replacement demand
- Calls Toto a "strategically critical semiconductor materials innovator"

[[Goldman Sachs]] upgraded to "buy" last month (Jan 2026) — citing AI data center investment driving demand.

Stock +39% YTD through mid-Feb 2026. +4.3% on day of Palliser disclosure (Feb 17).

## Comparable: Ajinomoto

Not the first Japanese non-tech company benefiting from AI. [[Ajinomoto]] uses resin derived from umami flavoring expertise to make insulation material (ABF substrate) between chips and motherboards — a critical semiconductor supply chain component.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Hidden semiconductor materials business undervalued — toilet maker trades at consumer staples multiples
- 5-year competitive moat in electrostatic chucks
- 30%+ revenue growth driven by 3D NAND layering trend
- Net cash position (JPY76B)
- Activist pressure for disclosure and capital efficiency

Bear:
- Core bathroom fixtures business is ex-growth
- Japan consumer exposure (aging demographics)
- Stock already +39% YTD — how much upside left?
- Semiconductor cycle risk — memory capex volatile
- Limited analyst coverage (9 analysts)
