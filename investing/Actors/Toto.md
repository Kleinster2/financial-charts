## Evolution

- 1917 — Founded as Toyo Toki by Kazuchika Okura in Kitakyushu. [[Japan]]'s first domestic manufacturer of Western-style flush toilets (prototyped from 1912).
- 1945 — Kokura (now Kitakyushu) was the original target for the second atomic bomb; clouds diverted the B-29 to Nagasaki. Factory survived.
- 1970 — Renamed from Toyo Toki to TOTO LTD. Developed 1.6-gallon water-saving toilet.
- 1980 — Launched Washlet — world's first microcomputer-controlled bidet toilet seat. Took 18 years to sell the first 1M units.
- 1988 — Began mass production of electrostatic chucks for semiconductor manufacturing. Ceramics expertise from 100+ years of toilet porcelain applied to wafer-clamping components.
- 1990 — Entered US market (TOTO Kiki U.S.A.). Atlanta manufacturing facility opened 1992.
- 1994 — Entered China (Beijing TOTO Co.). Nanjing and Dalian operations by 1996.
- 1998-99 — Asian financial crisis: revenue -13%, JPY21B net loss, 1,000 job cuts, six factories suspended.
- 2019-2025 — Washlet acceleration: 50M units (Apr 2019) → 60M (Aug 2022) → 70M (Nov 2025). Pace accelerating — 10M-unit increment took just 3 years 3 months (shortest ever).
- 2025 — Ceramics operating profit target raised to JPY25B (FY2026). JPY56.5B planned investment in ceramics expansion.
- Jan 2026 — [[Goldman Sachs]] upgraded to "buy" citing AI data center investment driving chuck demand.
- Feb 2026 — [[Palliser Capital]] goes public with activist campaign. Stock +39% YTD.

## Price

![[totdy-price-chart.png]]
*TOTDY (ADR) since Jan 2024. Rangebound $24-35 through 2025, then vertical breakout in Jan-Feb 2026 on Goldman upgrade + Palliser activist disclosure. At $40.30, near all-time high.*

![[totdy-vs-esc-peers-price-chart.png]]
*Toto vs ESC peers since Jul 2025 (normalized). [[NGK Insulators]] (NGKIF) +90% leads the group. Toto (+56%), [[Kyocera]] (KYOCY, +56%), [[Entegris]] (ENTG, +55%) tightly clustered. [[SEMCO Technologies]] (ALSEM.PA, +47%) mid-pack. [[Sumitomo Osaka Cement]] (5232.T, +18%) lagging. Entire group is bid — the ESC/advanced ceramics theme is being priced across the board, not just Toto.*

## Financials

### Annual (JPY millions, FY ends March)

| FY | Revenue | Op. Income | Net Income | Op. Margin |
|----|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 2025 | 724,454 | 48,480 | 12,168 | 6.7% |
| 2024 | 702,284 | 42,767 | 37,196 | 6.1% |
| 2023 | 701,187 | 49,122 | 38,943 | 7.0% |
| 2022 | 645,273 | 52,181 | 40,131 | 8.1% |
| 2021 | 580,935 | 41,352 | 27,199 | 7.1% |

FY2025 net income collapsed to JPY12.2B due to JPY34.1B asset writedown in Q4. Revenue growth modest at +3.2% YoY. Operating margins compressing from 8.1% (FY2022) to 6.7% (FY2025) — core bathroom fixtures business is the drag.

### Recent quarters (FY2026, JPY millions)

| Quarter | Revenue | Op. Income | Net Income |
|---------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Q3 (Oct-Dec 2025) | 197,727 | 19,638 | 19,750 |
| Q2 (Jul-Sep 2025) | 183,625 | 12,574 | 2,484 |
| Q1 (Apr-Jun 2025) | 165,747 | 8,208 | 6,306 |

9-month FY2026: revenue JPY547.1B, operating income JPY40.4B, net income JPY28.5B. Q3 beat analyst expectations (reported Jan 30, 2026). Annualized run-rate implies normalized P/E ~27x.

## Business segments

Global Sanitary Ware (~65% of revenue, but <50% of operating profit):
- Toilets, Washlet bidet seats, faucets, bathtubs, bathroom accessories
- Six geographic reporting segments: Japan, China, Asia-Oceania, Americas, Europe
- Japan ~65% of revenue; US is fastest-growing Washlet market
- Overseas revenue ratio crossing 30%+

Advanced Ceramics / New Business (revenue undisclosed, ~40-50% of operating profit):
- Electrostatic chucks for cryogenic etching in [[Memory|3D NAND]] manufacturing
- ~40% operating margin on ceramics (vs low single digits on fixtures)
- FY2025 ceramics OP target: JPY20B. FY2026 target: JPY25B
- Revenue estimated JPY45-55B range (inferred from OP and margin — not disclosed, per Palliser's complaint)
- Segment disclosure gap is precisely what [[Palliser Capital]] is pressuring management to fix

## Washlet business

Cumulative Washlet shipments: 70M+ units (milestone reached Nov 2025).

| Milestone | Date | Time for 10M increment |
|-----------|------|----------------------|
| 1M | ~1998 | 18 years from 1980 launch |
| 50M | Apr 2019 | — |
| 60M | Aug 2022 | 3 yr 4 mo |
| 70M | Nov 2025 | 3 yr 3 mo (fastest ever) |

- Japan household penetration: ~80% of multi-person households own electronic bidet toilet (Cabinet Office, 2018)
- US: fastest-growing Washlet market over last 5 years. COVID toilet paper shortages boosted awareness.
- Product lines: WASHLET bidet seats, WASHLET+ integrated toilets, NEOREST smart toilet systems
- Japan warm-seat toilet market share: ~54% (2012 data) vs [[LIXIL]] ~24%

## Advanced ceramics (semiconductor segment)

Electrostatic chucks for cryogenic etching tools used in [[Memory|3D NAND]] manufacturing:

- Ceramics remain stable at extremely low temperatures, clamping silicon wafers during precision etching
- As memory chips add more layers, cryogenic etching demand grows — Toto is a key supplier
- Division provides ~40-50% of Toto's operating profit (Register reports >50%; other sources say 40%)
- Technology roots: ceramic expertise from 100+ years of toilet manufacturing, applied to chucks since 1988
- Only recently became material to financials as 3D NAND layering intensified
- JPY56.5B strategic investment planned for ceramics expansion

---

## Palliser Capital activist campaign (Feb 2026)

[[Palliser Capital]] sent letter to Toto's board calling for more disclosure of the advanced ceramics segment:

- Invested ~6 months ago, now top 20 shareholder
- Thesis: ¥554B ($3.6B) valuation disconnect. 55%+ upside from disclosure, capital allocation, operational efficiency
- Estimates 5-year sustainable competitive advantage before rivals can catch up
- Projected 30%+ revenue growth over two years from memory chip upgrade cycle + replacement demand
- Demands: (1) ceramics segment disclosure, (2) cross-shareholding sales, (3) more efficient use of net cash, (4) ceramics business expansion

[[Goldman Sachs]] upgraded to "buy" last month (Jan 2026) — citing AI data center investment driving demand.

Stock +39% YTD through mid-Feb 2026. +4.3% on day of Palliser disclosure (Feb 17).

## Comparable: Ajinomoto

Not the first Japanese non-tech company benefiting from AI. [[Ajinomoto]] uses resin derived from umami flavoring expertise to make insulation material (ABF substrate) between chips and motherboards — a critical semiconductor supply chain component.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Hidden semiconductor materials business undervalued — toilet maker trades at consumer staples multiples
- 5-year competitive moat in electrostatic chucks
- 30%+ revenue growth driven by 3D NAND layering trend
- Net cash position (JPY76B) + activist pressure for capital efficiency
- Washlet secular adoption outside Japan (US fastest-growing market)
- Normalized P/E ~27x with ceramics growing at 30%+

Bear:
- Core bathroom fixtures business is ex-growth with compressing margins (8.1% → 6.7%)
- Japan consumer exposure (aging demographics, ~65% of revenue)
- Stock already +39% YTD / +60% over 12 months — how much upside left?
- Semiconductor cycle risk — memory capex volatile
- Limited analyst coverage (9 analysts)
- FY2025 writedown (JPY34.1B) raises questions about asset quality
- 5-year total return -17% vs Topix +93% — long-term track record is poor

---

## Analysis

Toto's valuation puzzle: a JPY1T company where ~half the operating profit comes from an undisclosed ceramics segment with ~40% margins and structural growth tailwinds. The bathroom fixtures business is a low-growth, Japan-heavy drag masking a high-margin semiconductor materials franchise. Palliser's playbook is straightforward — force disclosure, get the ceramics business valued on tech multiples instead of sanitary ware multiples, and unlock the gap. The [[Ajinomoto]] precedent (food company revalued as semiconductor materials supplier) validates the template. The risk is timing: the stock has already moved 39% YTD on this thesis, and memory capex is cyclical. The 5-year underperformance vs Topix (-17% vs +93%) shows the market hasn't sustainably revalued this — the question is whether Palliser's pressure finally forces the disclosure that changes the story.
