## Composition

Very energy-heavy: ~60% energy (WTI dominant), ~15% agriculture, ~15% industrial metals, ~10% precious metals and livestock. More energy-weighted than [[DBC]].

## Use Case

Alternative [[Commodities]] benchmark. GSG vs [[DBC]] in the dashboard — GSG is more energy-tilted, so divergence signals energy vs non-energy commodity dynamics.
