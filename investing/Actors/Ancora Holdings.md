## WBD activism (Feb 2026)

Ancora argues WBD's board did not adequately engage with Paramount Skydance over a rival offer for the whole company, including cable assets (CNN, TNT). Their pressure contributed to WBD opening a 7-day negotiation window with Paramount on Feb 17, 2026.

[[Pentwater Capital]] (~50M WBD shares) is aligned with Ancora in backing the Paramount bid.
