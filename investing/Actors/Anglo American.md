Global mining conglomerate (LSE: AAL). Diversified across copper, iron ore, platinum, and diamonds. Announced spinoff/sale of [[De Beers]] in May 2024, ending nearly a century-long relationship. Posted $3.7B annual loss in 2025 driven by $5.2B+ cumulative De Beers writedowns. Survived a hostile bid from [[BHP]] in 2024 by restructuring.
