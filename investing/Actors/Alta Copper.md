## Canariaco Norte

The deposit sits in the Lambayeque region of northern Peru at ~3,000m elevation. Pre-feasibility study envisions a conventional open-pit mine producing ~100kt Cu/year over a 20+ year mine life. [[Fortescue]] initially acquired a 36% stake before bidding for the remaining 64% in late 2025.

Court approval for the acquisition received January 30, 2026. Completion expected Q1 2026. This gives [[Fortescue]] its first material [[Copper|copper]] asset and begins diversification beyond [[Iron ore|iron ore]], though production is still 5-7 years away.
