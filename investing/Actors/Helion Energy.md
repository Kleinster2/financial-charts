---

## Why Helion matters

Helion is the most credible fusion-for-AI play:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Chairman | [[Sam Altman]] (since 2015) |
| Microsoft deal | First-ever fusion PPA (2028 target) |
| Valuation | $5.4B |
| Total raised | $1B+ |
| Approach | Pulsed non-ignition fusion |

---

## Sam Altman connection

**Altman's largest investment ever:**
- $375M personal investment (2021)
- Board chair since 2015
- Recruited Helion to Y Combinator
- Participated in 2025 $425M round

**The thesis:** Altman runs OpenAI (massive power consumer) and invests in Helion (power producer). He's betting AI needs fusion-scale energy.

> "Decreasing the cost of energy is one of the best ways to improve people's quality of lives." — Altman

## Microsoft PPA (May 2023)

**First-ever fusion electricity agreement:**
- Microsoft to buy power from Helion facility
- Target: 2028 (extremely ambitious)
- 50 MW+ initially
- Signals hyperscaler belief in fusion

**Why it matters:**
- Microsoft also did [[Constellation Energy]] fission deal
- Hedging across fission (works) and fusion (might work)
- Creates accountability — public commitment to 2028

---

## Technology: Pulsed fusion

**Helion's approach:**
- Pulsed, non-ignition fusion
- Deuterium-helium-3 fuel
- Direct electricity conversion (no steam turbine)
- Claims higher efficiency than tokamak designs

**Current status:**
- 7th prototype "Polaris" operating in Everett, WA
- Achieved plasma creation
- Not yet producing net electricity

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Polaris prototype | Operating now |

| Microsoft PPA delivery | 2028 |
| Commercial scale | 2028+ |

**Reality check:** No fusion company has delivered commercial electricity. 2028 is extremely aggressive.

## Helion vs TAE

| | Helion | [[TAE Technologies]] |
|---|---|---|
| **Backer** | Sam Altman | Trump/TMTG |
| **Fuel** | Deuterium-He3 | Hydrogen-boron |
| **Customer** | Microsoft PPA | None yet |
| **Valuation** | $5.4B | $6B (merger) |
| **Credibility** | Higher (PPA, prototype) | Lower (TMTG meme stock) |

---

## Investment case

**Bull (speculative):**
- Altman backing = smart money
- Microsoft PPA = customer validation
- Further along than most fusion
- Direct electricity approach novel

**Bear:**
- Fusion has never worked commercially
- 2028 almost certainly too optimistic
- Even Altman hedges with [[Oklo]] (fission)
- Private — can't invest directly

**Note:** Helion is private. No public stock. Exposure only through eventual IPO or via SoftBank (if it has material stake).
