## Key economic contributions

### Secular stagnation (2013)

At IMF speech in autumn 2013, Summers revived a discredited 1930s theory: the global economy had entered a long-term slump where lowering interest rates could no longer boost growth.

**Core argument:**
- Full-employment real interest rate had declined
- Combined with low inflation, this prevents achieving full employment
- Called it "the defining macroeconomic challenge of our times"

**Policy prescription:** Increased government spending on infrastructure, education, R&D — not austerity.

**Vindication:** 35-year decline in real interest rates across the world before COVID confirmed deep structural forces at work.

### 2021 inflation warning

When most economists celebrated pandemic recovery, Summers warned inflation was coming. He was right.

**March 2021:** Called Biden stimulus "the least responsible macroeconomic policy in forty years."

**His prediction (Bloomberg TV):**
- 1/3 chance: inflation accelerates significantly, stagflation like 1966-1969
- 1/3 chance: no inflation because Fed "hits the brakes hard," markets destabilize, economy skids toward recession
- 1/3 chance: soft landing

**Core argument:**
- Economy was $50B/month short due to pandemic
- Government injected $150-200B/month
- Overflow of demand → inflation

**Historical parallel:** Vietnam War era — expansionary fiscal policy without monetary restraint pushed inflation up substantially.

**Outcome:** Price spikes engulfed US economy, crushed consumers, forced Fed to spike rates to multi-decade highs.
