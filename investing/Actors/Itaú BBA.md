## What makes Itaú BBA, Itaú BBA

**Scale + consistency.** Largest bank in LatAm feeds deal flow. Itaú BBA has led Brazil DCM in 8 of the last 10 years — not a one-year wonder.

**DCM dominance.** When Brazil equity markets shut down (4 consecutive years without IPOs), Itaú BBA pivoted to debt. Record R$709B Brazil debt issuance in 2024 (+77.5% YoY) — Itaú BBA captured the lion's share.

**Full-service platform.** DCM, ECM, M&A, research, sales & trading. Not just advisory — they distribute paper to Itaú's institutional and wealth clients.

**Industry view:** Signs at end of 2025 indicate more promising 2026. Equities showing signs of recovery after 4 years without IPOs. But DCM remains the workhorse.
