## Thrive Capital

Founded 2009 with $5M seed from General Catalyst's Joel Cutler. Thrive has become one of the largest growth-stage tech investors, with a particular focus on AI:

- **[[OpenAI]]** — lead investor in major funding rounds; one of the largest outside shareholders
- **Oscar Health** — Kushner co-founded (health insurance startup, IPO 2021)
- **Early wins:** Instagram, Spotify, GitHub, Stripe, Slack
- **AI era:** Positioned as OpenAI's closest VC partner

Thrive's OpenAI position alone is worth tens of billions — making Kushner one of the biggest individual beneficiaries of the AI boom.

## Political positioning

Unusual position: brother of Trump's son-in-law, but historically Democratic-leaning. His appearance at the [[Hill and Valley Forum]] signals the broader convergence of tech money across party lines around AI and defense priorities.
