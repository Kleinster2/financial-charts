## Epstein investment

Jeffrey Epstein became a limited partner in Valar funds:

| Year | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 2015-2016 | $40M invested |
| 2026 | ~$170M current value |

**How it happened:**
- Epstein used [[Ehud Barak]] to get access to Thiel (2014)
- Nov 2014: Thiel emailed Epstein soliciting $10-20M
- Dec 2014: Meeting at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse with McCormack and Fitzgerald
- Initial $15M commitment grew to $40M across multiple funds

**Current status:** The Valar stake is the largest remaining asset in Epstein's estate (~$170M of ~$200M total). Locked in illiquid VC funds, likely years from distribution. Proceeds expected to go to estate beneficiaries (ex-girlfriends, advisers), not victims.

Valar spokesman confirmed investment occurred when Epstein was considered "a well-known adviser to world leaders, top universities and philanthropic organizations."
