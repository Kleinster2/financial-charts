# Gap

**Largest US specialty apparel retailer** — Old Navy (value, ~50% of revenue), Gap (casual), Banana Republic (workwear), Athleta (athletic). $15.1B revenue (FY24, +1%), all four brands gained market share. Operating income surged +80% YoY. CEO Richard Dickson (from Mattel/Barbie) driving turnaround since Aug 2023. The poster child for "dying middle" in fashion — but showing signs of life under new leadership.

## Brand portfolio

| Brand | Revenue | % of Total | Comp (FY24) | Status |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Old Navy** | ~$8B | ~50% | +3% | Value leader, highest growth |
| **Gap** | ~$3.5B | ~25% | +3% | Core casual, recovering |
| **Banana Republic** | ~$2B | ~15% | +4% | Workwear, culturally repositioning |
| **Athleta** | ~$1.3B | ~10% | +2% | Athletic, longer recovery |

**Old Navy:** The engine. Gained market share every quarter of FY24. Competes with Target, Walmart on value.

**Athleta:** The problem child. Down 13% in FY23, recovering slowly. Competes with [[Lululemon]], Alo, Vuori.

## Dickson turnaround

| Initiative | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Product focus** | Better design, less discounting |
| **Marketing** | "Gap is back" cultural relevance |
| **Inventory discipline** | Less excess, higher full-price selling |
| **Cost cuts** | Leaner operations |
| **Store optimization** | Closing underperformers |

Dickson successfully revived Barbie at Mattel before Gap. Early signs suggest similar playbook working.

## FY25 outlook

| Metric | FY25E |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue growth | +1.7% to +2% |
| Gross margin | ~50bps deleverage (tariffs) |
| Tariff impact | ~100-110bps headwind |

Tariff risk is real — Gap sources heavily from Asia.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Turnaround inflection (op income +80%, gross margin 20-yr high)
- Old Navy gaining share in value segment
- Dickson track record (Barbie turnaround)
- All four brands positive comps first time in years
- Stock cheap (~12x earnings) if turnaround sustains
- $1.5B operating cash flow

**Bear:**
- "Dying middle" structural problem — squeezed by [[Shein]]/Temu and [[TJX]]
- Athleta still struggling (Lululemon, Alo taking share)
- Tariff headwinds (100-110bps to gross margin)
- Revenue still essentially flat (+1%)
- Gap brand relevance — is it permanent or cyclical?
- Banana Republic workwear demand uncertain (hybrid work)
