**Lina Khan** — Former Chair of the FTC (2021-2025). Known for aggressive "Neo-Brandeisian" antitrust enforcement against Big Tech. **Departed January 2026** (or late 2025) as part of the [[Trump II]] deregulation sweep.

## Status (Jan 2026)

*   **Role:** Former FTC Chair.
*   **Replacement:** Replaced by a pro-business/deregulation appointee (likely effectively ending the "Khan era" of blocking M&A).
*   **Legacy:** Attempted to block major tech deals (Microsoft-Activision, etc.) with mixed court success. Her departure signals a "green light" for M&A.

## Impact on Investment Thesis

**The "Khan Constraint" is gone:**
*   **M&A Boom:** Removal removes the primary regulatory headwind for large-cap M&A.
*   **Big Tech:** Companies like [[Amazon]], [[Google]], and [[Microsoft]] face less immediate breakup risk (though DOJ cases continue).
*   **Pharma:** [[Biopharma]] M&A (a key exit for biotech) becomes easier.

## Relationship with Trump II

*   **Tension:** While some MAGA populists (JD Vance) admired her anti-Big Tech stance, the dominant "Deregulation" and "Economic Growth" wings ([[Elon Musk]], Wall Street donors) demanded her removal.
*   **Outcome:** The "Deregulation" pillar won out.
