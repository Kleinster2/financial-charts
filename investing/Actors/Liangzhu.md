**Liangzhu (良渚)** — Hipster suburb of Hangzhou. Indie AI developer hub. "Villagers" building quirky consumer AI apps. Ground zero for AI's lifestyle side.

---

## Why Liangzhu matters

Liangzhu represents [[China]]'s indie AI scene — distinct from frontier labs:

| Aspect | Liangzhu | Six Little Dragons |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Focus | [[Consumer]] apps, lifestyle | [[Robotics]], BCI, enterprise |
| Vibe | Hipster, creative | Technical, VC-backed |
| Products | ADHD calendars, fitness gamification | Humanoid robots, brain interfaces |
| Funding | Bootstrapped, small rounds | Unicorn hunting |
| [[Target]] | Global consumers | Enterprise, government |

---

## The scene

**Who's there:**
- Silicon Valley alumni
- Chinese big tech refugees
- Indie developers
- Aspiring entrepreneurs
- "Villagers" (self-identification)

**The appeal:**
- Low commercial pressure
- Creative, free lifestyle
- Sense of camaraderie
- Cheap to prototype ("1,000 RMB to demo")
- Inclusive — don't need unicorn ambitions

---

## What they're building

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Emotional AI | Apps meeting emotional needs |
| Lifestyle | Gamified fitness trackers |
| [[Productivity]] | ADHD-friendly calendar tools |
| Traditional Chinese | AI divination apps |
| [[Consumer]] hardware | Various AI-enhanced products |

**Philosophy:** AI for comfort, not just productivity.

---

## Business model

**Global-first strategy:**
- Launch in North America first
- Tap [[China]] hardware supply chains
- Offer competitive prices worldwide
- Avoid domestic competition
- Escape Chinese customer reluctance to pay for software

**The arbitrage:** Chinese development costs + hardware supply chain → global consumer prices.

---

## Investor interest

**Monthly demo day:**
- Started in a living room
- Now draws founders and backers from region
- Growing visibility

**Investor warnings:**
- Some startups just "AI washing" products
- Air conditioners, mirrors with AI — not every product will stick
- [[Consumer]] demand is an open question

---

## Hangzhou AI ecosystem layers

| Layer | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Frontier labs | [[DeepSeek]], [[Alibaba]] [[Qwen]] |
| Six Little Dragons | [[Unitree]], Zhiyuan, BCI startups |
| **Indie/consumer** | Liangzhu villagers |
| Hardware | Supply chain for global products |

Liangzhu = the long tail of [[China]] AI.

---

## Investment angle

**Not directly investable** (indie developers, not VC-scale), but signals:

| [[Signal]] | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Talent density | Hangzhou AI ecosystem depth |
| Global ambitions | Chinese AI going overseas |
| [[Consumer]] AI | New product categories emerging |
| Hardware arbitrage | Competitive threat to Western consumer AI |

**Watch for:** Breakout consumer AI product from Liangzhu hitting Western markets.
