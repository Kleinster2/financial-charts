# Nike

**World's largest sportswear company** — in deep turnaround under CEO Elliott Hill (from Oct 2024, a 32-year Nike veteran). FY25 revenue $46.3B (-10%), net income $3.2B (-44%). Lost innovation edge, ceded market share to [[Adidas]], On Running, Hoka. "Win Now" strategy: cut promotions, rebuild wholesale, return to sport-first. Tariff headwinds: $1.5B estimated FY26 impact.

## Competitive landscape

|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Nike** | $46.3B | Declining | Turnaround |
| **[[Adidas]]** | €23.7B | Growing (+12%) | Resurgent |
| On Running | ~$2.5B | +30%+ | Hot challenger |

| New Balance | ~$7B (private) | Growing | Heritage revival |
| [[Lululemon]] | $10.6B | Slowing | Athletic lifestyle |

## Stock performance

| Period | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| 2024 | -27% (vs S&P +27%) |
| Elliott Hill announcement | +8% single day |
| Last 12 months | -12% |
| From ATH (~$179) | Down ~55% |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Elliott Hill is a "Nike lifer" who knows the culture
- Wholesale rebuild = regaining distribution
- Innovation pipeline refilling
- $46B revenue at trough — massive base
- Stock at decade-low valuation (~20x trough earnings)
- Brand still #1 globally in recognition

**Bear:**
- Turnaround "will take a while" (Hill's own words)
- $1.5B tariff headwind compresses margins
- Competitors (On, Hoka, Adidas) have momentum
- DTC strategy reversal = admission of failure
- Consumer may not accept 15-18% price increases
- No quick fix for innovation drought
