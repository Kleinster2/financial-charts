## Why Fourier matters

Fourier represents the **rehab-to-humanoid pipeline** — deep expertise in human biomechanics from years of building exoskeletons and rehabilitation robots, now applied to general-purpose humanoids.

**Differentiation:** While [[Unitree]] targets mass-market affordability and [[AGIBOT]] focuses on industrial applications, Fourier's healthcare DNA gives it a unique angle on "care-bots" — humanoids designed for elderly care, assisted living, and medical settings where trust and soft interaction matter.

**Open-source play:** In April 2025, Fourier released the N1 as their first open-source humanoid, signaling ecosystem ambitions beyond hardware sales.

## Founder: [[Alex Gu]]

| Background | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Education | BS Mechanics, [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] (2003) |
| Early career | National Instruments — data collection, signal processing |
| First startup | Jinghe Robot (2012) — developed Flexbot rehab robot |
| Exit | Acquired by QJ Rehab (2015) |
| Fourier | Founded July 2015 in Zhangjiang, Shanghai |

Gu was on Shanghai Jiao Tong's first robotics team, competing in RoboCup Asia-Pacific 2002. Named the company after mathematician Joseph Fourier, who laid the mathematical foundation for signal processing — fitting for a company that started in rehab robotics (signal processing for human motion).

**Political access:** One of seven tech executives who presented to Xi Jinping during his Shanghai visit, indicating government support for the humanoid push.

### GR-3 "Care-bot" (CES 2026 debut)

Fourier's first CES appearance. Designed for healthcare/elderly care with approachable aesthetics:
- Morandi warm-tone color palette
- Supercar-grade upholstery, eco-friendly lining
- Full-Perception Multimodal Interaction System (visual, audio, tactile)
- Hybrid decision architecture: fast reflexive control + LLM reasoning

CES demos: Tic-tac-toe (visual recognition + logical reasoning), dance routines (whole-body motion control).

Also showed a **desktop companion robot concept** — doll-sized, personalizable, exploring compact AI companionship.

## Competitive position

| vs | Fourier advantage | Fourier weakness |
|----|-------------------|------------------|
| [[Unitree]] | Healthcare expertise, premium positioning | Behind on mass-market, price |
| [[AGIBOT]] | Established revenue (rehab), global reach | Less pure humanoid focus |
| [[Figure AI]] | Shipping product, open-source play | Less funding, no US presence |
| [[Boston Dynamics]] | China cost structure | Capability gap |

**Moat:** 2,000+ medical institution relationships built over years of rehab robotics. Trust matters in healthcare — can't be replicated quickly.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Healthcare positioning differentiated from crowded industrial humanoid space
- Existing revenue from rehab business funds humanoid R&D
- Government backing (Xi presentation)
- Open-source N1 could build developer ecosystem
- [[SoftBank]] backing provides capital + network

**Bear:**
- Private, no direct investment access
- US-[[China]] tensions limit Western market
- Healthcare humanoids = longer sales cycles than industrial
- Valuation unclear ($136M estimate seems low vs funding)
