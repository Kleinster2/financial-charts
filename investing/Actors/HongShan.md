## Sequoia split (2024)

In June 2023, [[Sequoia Capital]] announced split into three independent entities:

| Entity | Region | Rebrand |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Sequoia Capital | US/Europe | Kept name |
| **HongShan** | China | 红杉 = "redwood" in Chinese |
| Peak XV Partners | India/SEA | New name |

Split completed March 31, 2024. Each entity now operates independently with no shared economics or governance.

**Why split:** US-China tensions, LP pressure, regulatory scrutiny on cross-border VC.

## Investment focus

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Technology** | AI, semiconductors, enterprise software |

## Capital deployment

**$9B dry powder** — reportedly slow to deploy (The Information, 2025). Looking for deals outside China given:
- Domestic macro weakness
- Regulatory uncertainty
- US-China decoupling

**Geographic expansion:**
- Singapore office (2023) — SEA base
- London, Tokyo offices

## Leadership

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| **Neil Shen** (沈南鹏) | Founding Managing Partner |

Neil Shen consistently ranked among world's top VCs. Founded Ctrip (TCOM) before joining Sequoia.

## Investment lens

**Not directly investable** (private firm). Matters as:
- Signal of China VC sentiment
- Major backer of Chinese tech ecosystem
- Portfolio companies = investable
- Indicator of where smart China money flows
