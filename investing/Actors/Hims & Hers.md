![[hims-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue ramp from $149M (2020) to ~$2.3B run rate; first profitable year in 2024 ($126M net income, partially from $68M deferred tax benefit). Growth decelerating from 111% (Q1 2025) to ~49% (Q3 2025) as GLP-1 headwinds build.*

## [[GLP-1 receptor agonists|GLP-1]] / weight loss — the central risk

The [[GLP-1 receptor agonists|GLP-1]] story is the reason HIMS trades at 2.3x revenue and not 6x.

- May 2024: Begins prescribing compounded semaglutide under FDA drug shortage rules (semaglutide on shortage list since 2022). Generated ~$225M in 2024 (~15% of revenue).
- Feb 2025: FDA declares semaglutide shortage resolved. Stock drops ~41%.
- Apr 2025: [[Novo Nordisk]] partnership — Wegovy on Hims platform at $599/month. Stock rallies.
- Jun 2025: [[Novo Nordisk]] terminates partnership, accuses Hims of continued compounding and deceptive marketing. Stock drops 34%.
- Sep 2025: FDA warning letter over misleading semaglutide claims on forhers.com.
- Feb 5, 2026: Launches compounded oral semaglutide pill at $49/month.
- Feb 6-7, 2026: FDA restricts compounded GLP-1 ingredients, HHS refers Hims to DOJ. Stock drops ~16%.

2025 weight loss guidance: $725M (~31% of total revenue), but this includes non-semaglutide products (liraglutide generic, oral meds, "personalized" dosing). The compounding loophole is actively closing. Generic semaglutide not available in US until ~2032 due to [[Novo Nordisk]] patents.

## Price

![[hims-vs-lly-vs-nvo-price-chart.png]]
*Since SPAC listing (Jan 2021), HIMS has trailed [[Eli Lilly]] dramatically but outperformed [[Novo Nordisk]]. Extreme volatility — 52-week range of ~$17-$72. The Feb 2025 FDA shortage resolution and Jun 2025 Novo partnership collapse each triggered 30%+ drawdowns.*

## Business segments

- Sexual health (original): ED, premature ejaculation (him), birth control (her). Mature, steady.
- Hair & dermatology: Finasteride, minoxidil, skincare. Growing.
- Mental health: Anxiety, depression, insomnia. Therapy and psychiatry referrals.
- Weight loss: The growth/risk engine. ~31% of 2025E revenue.
- Hers brand: On track for $1B+ by 2026 — dermatology, weight loss, menopause, hormones.

## International expansion

- ZAVA acquisition (announced Jun 2025, closing H2 2025): UK, Germany, France, Ireland — 1.3M customers.
- Livewell (Canada, acquired 2025).
- Honest Health (UK, acquired 2021).
- Management targets $1B+ international revenue opportunity.

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Overlap |
|-----------|---------|
| [[Novo Nordisk]], [[Eli Lilly]] | GLP-1 makers going direct (LillyDirect, NovoCare) |
| Ro (Roman) | Direct DTC competitor across all categories |
| [[Amazon]] (One Medical) | Telehealth + pharmacy; HIMS dropped 20% on Amazon entry |
| LifeMD (LFMD) | Telehealth, GLP-1 prescribing |
| Noom | Weight management + behavioral coaching |

Key differentiator: vertical integration (own pharmacy, fulfillment, medical group) and largest DTC subscriber base. Strong brand among 25-44 demographic.

## Bull case

- Core business (ex-GLP-1) grew 43% YoY in 2024 — platform is not just semaglutide
- Revenue approaching $2.3B with path to $6.5B by 2030 (management targets)
- $1.1B cash, minimal debt — fortress balance sheet
- ARPU rising 19% YoY; multi-condition subscribers growing 80% YoY
- International expansion (ZAVA) adds large addressable markets
- At ~2.3x EV/revenue, cheap for a 50%+ grower if GLP-1 risk is contained
- Personalized treatment plans and multi-condition model reduce single-product dependency

## Bear case

- Regulatory existential risk: FDA crackdown + DOJ referral could eliminate a $725M+ revenue stream and expose company to legal liability
- Novo Nordisk hostility: Terminated partnership, threatening lawsuits, lobbying FDA
- Gross margin compression: 82% (2023) to 74% (Q3 2025) — weight loss mix and fulfillment costs
- Growth deceleration: 111% (Q1 2025) to 49% (Q3 2025) to guided 26-30% (Q4 2025)
- No moat: No proprietary IP, patents, or diagnostics. 39% of revenue spent on marketing.
- Dual-class voting: CEO controls ~90% of votes
- Management credibility: Launched $49 semaglutide pill knowing it would provoke FDA; FDA warning letter; Novo accused them of deceptive marketing
