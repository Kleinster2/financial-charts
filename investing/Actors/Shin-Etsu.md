## Capacity expansion

**Responding to AI demand:**
- 300mm capacity additions ongoing
- [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], US facilities
- Targeting 10%+ capacity growth
- Wafer shortage through 2025-2026

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Upstream monopoly position
- AI chip demand = wafer demand
- Pricing power (shortage)
- Diversified (PVC hedge)
- Strong balance sheet

**Bear:**
- Cyclical (chip cycles)
- Yen exposure
- Samsung/SK vertical integration
- [[China]] capacity risk
