Inertia Enterprises — fusion energy startup building inertial confinement fusion (ICF) power plants based on [[National Ignition Facility]] technology. Founded by [[Twilio]] co-founder [[Jeff Lawson]], NIF lead designer [[Annie Kritcher]], and Stanford laser physicist [[Mike Dunne]]. Raised $450M Series A (Feb 2026) led by [[Bessemer Venture Partners]]. HQ Livermore, California.

## Why Inertia matters

Only fusion company building on ICF — the sole approach that has achieved scientific breakeven (NIF, Dec 2022). Competitors ([[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]], [[Helion Energy]], [[TAE Technologies]]) use magnetic confinement or pulsed approaches that have not yet demonstrated net energy gain.

## Technology: Thunderwall

Inertia's approach scales NIF's ICF physics into a commercial power plant. NIF proved the science; Inertia's challenge is engineering cost and repetition rate.

| Parameter | NIF | Inertia (Thunderwall) |
|-----------|-----|----------------------|
| Lasers | 192 large | ~1,000 small (semiconductor diode) |
| Pulse rate | ~1 shot/day | 10 pulses/second |
| Target cost | Dozens of hours to fabricate | <$1 each (mass-manufactured) |
| Target size | — | 4.5 mm |
| Beam energy | — | 10 kJ per beam |
| Wallplug efficiency | ~1% | 10% (target) |
| Average power | — | 50x NIF-class comparable lasers |

How ICF works: lasers fire on a small target capsule. Laser light converts to X-rays inside a hohlraum, which compress and heat a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet until atoms fuse, releasing energy. NIF achieved this in Dec 2022 — more energy out of the target than laser energy in.

Key engineering challenges:
- Repetition rate (from ~1/day to 10/sec)
- Target mass manufacturing at <$1/unit
- Laser cost reduction via semiconductor diodes
- Tritium breeding and fuel cycle
- Plant-scale heat capture and power conversion

### Cap table (estimated)

| Holder | Est. stake | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Founders (Lawson, Kritcher, Dunne) | Majority | Pre-Series A |
| [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] | Significant | Series A lead |
| [[GV]] | Minor | Series A |
| Other Series A investors | Minor | 7 additional firms |

Ownership percentages undisclosed. $450M at unknown valuation.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|
| Thunderwall laser beamline | Near-term (funded) |
| Target assembly plant | Near-term (funded) |
| Fusion pilot plant | Late 2020s |
| First GW-scale power plant | ~2030 (construction start) |
| Commercial grid power | 2030s |

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | Status | Funding |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Inertia Enterprises | ICF (laser) | Pre-prototype, proven physics | $450M |
| [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] | Tokamak (magnetic) | Building SPARC | $2B+ |
| [[Helion Energy]] | Pulsed FRC | Microsoft PPA for 2028 | $1B+ |
| [[TAE Technologies]] | Field-reversed config | Multiple prototypes | $1.2B+ |
| [[Zap Energy]] | Z-pinch | Early stage | $300M+ |

Inertia's differentiator: ICF is the only approach that has demonstrated scientific breakeven. All competitors are still working toward that milestone. The risk shifts from "does the physics work?" to "can we engineer it commercially?"

## Investment context

Why this matters for the thesis:
- Data centers consuming ~4% of US power, doubling within 5 years at ~15% CAGR
- 44GW power gap ([[Morgan Stanley]] estimate) requires new baseload sources
- Fusion solves the scale problem nuclear fission faces (no meltdown risk, no long-lived waste, abundant fuel)
- $450M Series A is among the largest fusion rounds ever — signals institutional conviction

Risks:
- Engineering gap between NIF proof-of-concept and commercial plant is enormous
- 10 pulses/sec repetition rate is orders of magnitude beyond NIF
- Target manufacturing at <$1/unit at scale is unproven
- Tritium supply constraints affect all D-T fusion approaches
- Timeline risk — "within a decade" may stretch
- Private company — no public market access
