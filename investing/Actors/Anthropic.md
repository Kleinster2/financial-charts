## Recent developments (Dec 2025)

**IPO prep:**
- Engaged Wilson Sonsini (law firm)
- Valuation $300-350B post latest investments

**Product milestones:**
- **Claude Code hit $1B milestone**
- **Bun acquisition** — JavaScript runtime, infrastructure play
- **Agent Skills** open standard launched (Dec 18) — integrations with Notion, Canva, Figma, Atlassian

**Partnerships:**
- **DOE Genesis Mission** — Multi-year partnership across 17 national labs
- **Accenture** — 30,000 professionals to be trained, enterprise deployment focus

**Citi ASIC projections:**
- $0 (F25) → **$20.9B (F26E)** → $4.4B (F27E) via [[Broadcom]]

## Why more efficient than OpenAI

- Enterprise-focused (higher margins, stickier)
- Avoiding costly image/video generation
- More disciplined spending
- Less consumer acquisition cost

---

## Compute strategy

- **1M+ TPU v7 (Ironwood)** commitment starting 2026 — largest TPU deployment ever
- Buying 400k TPUv7 (~$10B from [[Broadcom]])
- Renting 600k TPUv7 through Google Cloud (~$42B)
- Deploying in own facilities with TeraWulf/Cipher Mining (Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI)
- Going TPU route, not NVIDIA
- **Over 1GW of TPU capacity** planned

All flows to [[TSMC]] — TPUs fabbed there.

---

## Strategic dependencies

- **[[Google]]** — Cloud partner, investor
- **[[Amazon]]** — Investor, AWS partnership
- **[[Broadcom]]** — TPU supplier

Less dependent on single partner than OpenAI-Microsoft.

## Agentic code moat

Anthropic is capturing the "agentic code orchestrator" niche:

- **Claude Code** — production agent, not autocomplete
- **Agent SDK** — platform for building agents
- **Trust layer** — enterprise won't let unreliable agents touch code
- **55% of enterprise AI spend** is coding — largest category

See [[Long Anthropic]] for full thesis.

## For theses

**[[Long Anthropic]]**: Agentic code orchestrator moat, enterprise trust
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Locking TSMC capacity via TPUs
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Validates AI capex
**[[Model lab economics]]**: Best-positioned lab for profitability
