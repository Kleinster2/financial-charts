## Recent developments (Dec 2025)

**IPO prep:**
- Engaged Wilson Sonsini (law firm)
- Valuation $300-350B post latest investments

**Product milestones:**
- **Claude Code hit $1B milestone**
- **Bun acquisition** — JavaScript runtime, infrastructure play
- **Agent Skills** open standard launched (Dec 18) — integrations with Notion, Canva, Figma, Atlassian

**Partnerships:**
- **DOE Genesis Mission** — Multi-year partnership across 17 national labs
- **Accenture** — 30,000 professionals to be trained, enterprise deployment focus

**Citi ASIC projections:**
- $0 (F25) → **$20.9B (F26E)** → $4.4B (F27E) via [[Broadcom]]

## Why more efficient than OpenAI

- Enterprise-focused (higher margins, stickier)
- Avoiding costly image/video generation
- More disciplined spending
- Less consumer acquisition cost

## Compute strategy

**~1M TPUv7 commitment** — largest TPU deployment ever, reducing Google dependency.

| Component | Units | Source | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| TPUv7 direct purchase | ~1,000,000 | [[Broadcom]] direct | Anthropic-owned |
| Deployment facilities | — | TeraWulf, Hut 8, Cipher Mining | Crypto miners pivoting |
| Operations | — | [[FluidStack]] | Cabling, burn-in, testing |

**Structure (per SemiAnalysis, Jan 2026):**
- Anthropic buys TPUs directly from Broadcom (not through Google)
- Deploys in **Anthropic-controlled facilities** (not Google Cloud)
- Crypto miners ([[TeraWulf]], [[Hut 8]], [[Cipher Mining]]) provide DC infrastructure
- [[FluidStack]] handles deployment: cabling, burn-in, acceptance testing, remote-hands

**Why this matters:**
- Independence from Google Cloud
- Own infrastructure = lower long-term cost
- Validates crypto-to-AI pivot thesis
- Going TPU route, not NVIDIA

All flows to [[TSMC]] — TPUs fabbed there.

---

## Strategic dependencies

- **[[Google]]** — Cloud partner, investor
- **[[Amazon]]** — Investor, AWS partnership
- **[[Broadcom]]** — TPU supplier

Less dependent on single partner than OpenAI-Microsoft.

---

## Agentic code moat

Anthropic is capturing the "agentic code orchestrator" niche:

- **Claude Code** — production agent, not autocomplete
- **Agent SDK** — platform for building agents
- **Trust layer** — enterprise won't let unreliable agents touch code
- **55% of enterprise AI spend** is coding — largest category

See [[Long Anthropic]] for full thesis.

## For theses

**[[Long Anthropic]]**: Agentic code orchestrator moat, enterprise trust
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Locking TSMC capacity via TPUs
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Validates AI capex
**[[Model lab economics]]**: Best-positioned lab for profitability
