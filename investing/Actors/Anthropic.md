### Harness crackdown + Clawdbot OAuth cutoff (Jan 2026)

Jan 9: Restricted Claude Code OAuth access, blocking third-party tools (OpenCode, [[OpenClaw|Clawdbot]], etc.) from using Max subscription benefits. This broke [[OpenClaw|Clawdbot]] integrations 18 days *before* the Jan 27 cease-and-desist over the "Clawdbot" name (Anthropic trademark claim on "Claude"). The OAuth cutoff - not the naming dispute - was the initial disruption that forced the project to adapt. Sources: HackerNoon, Business Insider, Reddit.

What happened:
- Claude Code enforces token limits client-side: 5-hour rolling windows (~220K tokens for Max20) + weekly token caps
- "Hours" in Anthropic marketing (e.g., "24-40 hrs Opus/week") are estimated usage time, not separate limits - all token-based
- Rate limits are enforced by the Claude Code CLI locally, not server-side. This is the critical design flaw that enabled arbitrage.
- Tools like OpenCode extracted the OAuth token and talked to Anthropic's API directly, getting Max-tier authentication without any of the client-side rate limiting
- Result: overnight autonomous loops consuming weeks of token allocation in hours — $200/mo users burning through what would cost thousands at API rates
- Tools that wrap the actual Claude Code CLI (like [[OpenClaw]]) still hit the normal rate limits because Claude Code's client-side governor is intact

Fallout:
- 147+ GitHub reactions, 245 HN points
- DHH called it "very customer hostile"
- Many Max subscribers canceled
- [[xAI]] employees cut off from Claude via [[Cursor]] - Tony Wu: "rly pushes us to develop our own coding product"
- OpenAI employees already blocked Aug 2025

Official rationale (Shihipar): Technical instability - unauthorized harnesses introduce bugs Anthropic can't diagnose.

Response: OpenCode launched "OpenCode Black" ($200/mo) via enterprise gateways.

Thesis implication: Not harness moat defense - compute arbitrage enforcement. Third-party harnesses still work via enterprise pricing (OpenCode Black). Anthropic protecting margin on Max subscription, not blocking competition.

Feb 20 update: Anthropic revised its legal terms to make the ban explicit. Updated legal compliance page now states: "Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service - including the Agent SDK - is not permitted." OpenCode received a direct legal notice and pushed code the same day removing Claude Pro/Max and API key support, citing "anthropic legal requests." The Register reported the story. OpenAI's Thibault Sottiaux pointedly endorsed Codex subscription use in third-party harnesses - [[OpenAI]], [[GitHub]], and GitLab all explicitly allow subscription use in third-party tools. Anthropic is the only frontier provider actively blocking this. Community backlash intensifying - "vote with your wallets" sentiment growing.

### Pentagon clash over military AI (Jan-Feb 2026)

Anthropic and the Pentagon are in an escalating standoff over a ~$200M contract (via [[Palantir]] partnership). Pentagon pushing all four AI contractors ([[Google]], [[OpenAI]], [[xAI]], Anthropic) to allow "all lawful purposes" military use - including weapons development, intelligence collection, and battlefield operations. Anthropic alone is holding two red lines:
1. Fully autonomous weapons
2. Mass surveillance of Americans

**Timeline:**
- Jan 9: Defense Secretary [[Pete Hegseth]]'s AI strategy memo states Pentagon needs models "free from usage policy constraints"
- Jan 16: Hegseth criticized Anthropic when announcing [[xAI]]'s Grok would join Pentagon AI providers, railing against models that "won't allow you to fight wars"
- Jan 30: Reuters reported the $200M contract standoff
- Feb 12: Reuters reported Pentagon pushing AI companies onto classified networks without standard restrictions
- Feb 13: Axios/WSJ reported Claude was used during the [[Maduro capture operation]] (via [[Palantir]]). An Anthropic employee subsequently asked [[Palantir]] how Claude was being used in the operation
- Feb 15: Axios exclusive - Pentagon "fed up," threatening to cut Anthropic entirely. Administration official: "everything's on the table… but there'll have to be an orderly replacement"
- Feb 17-18: Escalation - Pentagon reviewing entire Anthropic partnership, may ask contractors to **certify they don't use Claude**. Pentagon now designates Anthropic a **"supply-chain risk"** - a term typically reserved for foreign adversaries
- Feb 23: Hegseth summoned [[Dario Amodei]] to the Pentagon for a Tuesday morning meeting
- Feb 24: Tense meeting. Hegseth set **Friday 5:01 PM ET deadline** (Feb 28). Told Dario no private company will dictate how the Pentagon makes operational decisions. Threatened two penalties: invoke the **[[Defense Production Act]]** to compel Claude deployment regardless of consent, and label Anthropic a **supply-chain risk** (normally reserved for foreign adversaries like [[Huawei]]). Anthropic spokesperson called it a "good-faith conversation"
- Feb 25: Anthropic "digs in heels" — no plans to comply. [[xAI]] approved for classified network deployment — Pentagon now has a second supplier. Dario noted valuation and revenue have only grown since taking this stand

See [[Pentagon AI access dispute 2026]] for the full event arc — DPA legal analysis, competitive dynamics, congressional vacuum, investor implications.

**Anthropic's position:** Two hard red lines: no autonomous weapons, no mass surveillance of Americans. Willing to allow missile defense, cyber defense, and other specific uses. [[Dario Amodei]] wrote AI should support national defense "in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries."

**Pentagon's position:** "All lawful use" without case-by-case negotiation. Commercial AI should be deployable the same way any purchased technology is — the military decides.

**Competitive dynamics:** [[OpenAI]], [[Google]], and [[xAI]] have all agreed to deploy for all lawful military uses — Anthropic alone has not. [[xAI]] now approved for classified networks (Feb 25), breaking Anthropic's monopoly.

### Trump AI Czar endorsement at Davos (Jan 23, 2026)

[[David Sacks]] (White House AI/[[Crypto]] Czar) highlighted Claude Code at Davos as the product "everyone's going crazy over":
- Called it "powered by Anthropic's Opus 4.5" - "a real breakthrough in coding"
- Described it as beginning of personal digital assistants - not just code, but all knowledge worker output
- Mentioned "co-work" tab: non-coders can create spreadsheets, PowerPoints, websites
- Can point at user's file drive and email - emulates style and format of existing work
- "Just need one more layer of abstraction on top of a tool like that and you'll have your own personal digital assistant"
- Predicted this could happen in 2026: coding assistants → personal digital assistants
- Referenced movie "Her" (Joaquin Phoenix, voice interface)

Significance: First time a sitting White House official has publicly endorsed a specific AI product by name at a major international forum. Reinforces Anthropic's positioning as the leading coding/agent AI company.

### Claude Opus 4.6 launch (Feb 5, 2026)

Most capable model to date. Key improvements over Opus 4.5:

| Benchmark | Opus 4.6 | Opus 4.5 | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | 65.4% | - | #1 agentic coding eval |
| Humanity's Last Exam | #1 | - | Multidisciplinary reasoning |
| GDPval-AA | +190 Elo vs 4.5 | - | Also +144 Elo vs GPT-5.2 |

### Grid infrastructure pledge (Feb 11, 2026)

Anthropic committed to covering 100% of electricity price increases that consumers face from its data centers:

1. Grid upgrades: Pay 100% of interconnection costs that would otherwise be passed to ratepayers
2. New power generation: Bring new generation online rather than buying credits or contracting existing power
3. Peak demand curtailment: Investing in systems that cut DC power during peak demand + grid optimization tools
4. Utility collaboration: Where new generation isn't yet available, work with utilities and independent experts to assess and offset price increases

[[Dario Amodei]]: American households shouldn't foot the bill for AI development.

Scale context: Training a single frontier model will soon require gigawatts. US AI sector needs 50+ GW of capacity. Data centers currently ~4.4% of US power, could surge to 12% by 2028 (with ~25% generation price increase risk).

DC locations (from Nov 2025 $50B [[FluidStack]] partnership): Mitchell County TX, Niagara County NY, southeast Louisiana. Hundreds of permanent jobs, thousands of construction positions.

Follows [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s Truth Social request for Big Tech to "pay their own way." [[Microsoft]] already showed willingness. [[OpenAI]] also pledged similarly. Anthropic also calling for systemic reform - faster permitting, transmission development, grid interconnection.

### $20M donation to [[Public First Action]] (Feb 12, 2026)

Anthropic donating $20M to [[Public First Action]], a bipartisan 501(c)(4) supporting AI safety regulation in 2026 midterms. Founded by two former members of Congress. Plans to back 30-50 candidates from both parties in state and federal races.

Policy priorities:
- Frontier AI company transparency and public visibility into risk management
- Robust federal AI governance (opposing state preemption without strong federal standard)
- Smart export controls on AI chips
- Targeted regulation on AI-enabled bioweapons and cyberattacks

Initial campaigns: Ads supporting Sen. [[Marsha Blackburn]] (R-TN, running for governor). Affiliated Defending Our Values PAC supporting Sen. [[Pete Ricketts]] (R-NE, reelection).

Opposed by Leading the Future PAC ($125M budget, backed by [[Greg Brockman]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]]) - pushing lighter regulation.

[[David Sacks]] responded on X: Anthropic "running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering" and "principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy."

Polling: 69% of Americans think government "not doing enough to regulate AI."

### Skills platform launch (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)

Anthropic launched **Skills** - packaged instruction folders that teach Claude reusable workflows. Published as an **open standard** designed to be portable across AI platforms, not just Claude. This is Anthropic's developer ecosystem/platform play beyond just selling model access.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launch | Organization-level deployment Dec 18, 2025 |
| API | `/v1/skills` endpoint, `container.skills` parameter in Messages API |
| Format | `SKILL.md` + scripts/references/assets per skill folder |
| Architecture | Three-level progressive disclosure (frontmatter → SKILL.md body → linked files) |
| Surfaces | [[Claude]].ai, [[Claude]] Code, API |
| Built-in tooling | skill-creator skill in Claude.ai |
| Partner directory | [[Asana]], [[Atlassian]], [[Canva]], [[Figma]], [[Sentry]], [[Zapier]] |

**Strategic significance:** Skills are Anthropic's answer to [[OpenAI]]'s custom GPTs and agent SDK approach, but with a key difference - open standard portability vs. platform lock-in. By publishing Skills as a specification any AI platform can adopt, Anthropic is betting that ecosystem gravity (developer tooling, partner integrations) matters more than proprietary lock-in. Same playbook as [[MCP]] - originate the standard, benefit from adoption.

Combined with [[MCP]] (tool connectivity) and [[Claude]] Code (agentic execution), Skills complete a three-layer developer platform: **what Claude can connect to** (MCP) → **what Claude knows how to do** (Skills) → **where Claude runs** (Code/API). This positions Anthropic as a full-stack AI developer platform, not just a model provider.

### Claude Code GitHub penetration (Feb 2026)

4% of GitHub public commits now authored by Claude Code. Projected to reach 20%+ of daily commits by end of 2026. Claude Code business subscriptions quadrupled since start of 2026. More than half of Claude Code revenue ($2.5B run rate) comes from enterprise.

## Why more efficient than OpenAI

Cumulative losses to profitability:

| Company | Cumulative burn | Break-even | Source |
|---------|----------------|------------|--------|
| Anthropic | ~$12-15B | 2028 | WSJ, The Information |
| OpenAI | $115-143B | 2029-2030 | The Information, [[Deutsche Bank]] |

Anthropic needs ~8-10x less capital than OpenAI to reach profitability.

OpenAI also faces a $207B funding shortfall through 2030 ([[HSBC]]).

Daniela Amodei (CNBC, Jan 2026):
> "Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models."

> "We are just much more efficient at how we use those resources."

Dario's investor pitch: build cutting-edge models at 1/10th the cost.

Why:
- Enterprise-focused (higher margins, stickier)
- Avoiding costly image/video generation
- Algorithmic efficiency over brute-force scale
- Less consumer acquisition cost

OpenAI's commitments for comparison:
- Stargate US: $500B over 4 years ([[SoftBank]], [[Oracle]], [[MGX]])
- Stargate Norway: 100,000 GPUs by end 2026
- Total compute commitments by 2033: $1.4T ([[HSBC]]/[[Deutsche Bank]])

## Compute strategy

Multi-cloud approach - AWS Trainium + Google TPUs + NVIDIA GPUs. Diversified to avoid single-vendor lock-in.

### Google Cloud deal (Oct 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TPU commitment | Up to 1M TPUs |
| Deal value | "Tens of billions of dollars" |
| Capacity | 1GW+ online in 2026 |
| Chip cost estimate | ~$35B of ~$50B total DC cost |

Largest expansion of Anthropic's TPU usage to date. Separate from Broadcom direct purchases.

### AWS partnership (Project Rainier)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Chips | Hundreds of thousands of Trainium |
| Facilities | Multiple US data centers |
| Relationship | "Primary training partner and cloud provider" |
| AWS revenue impact | 1-2 pp in late 2024, 5+ pp expected H2 2025 (Rothschild) |

### Broadcom direct TPUs (~1M TPUv7)

| Component | Source | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| TPUv7 chips | [[Broadcom]] direct | Anthropic-owned, not through Google |
| DC infrastructure | TeraWulf, Hut 8, Cipher Mining | [[Crypto]] miners pivoting |
| Operations | [[FluidStack]] | Cabling, burn-in, testing |

Why direct purchase matters:
- Independence from Google Cloud pricing
- Own infrastructure = lower long-term cost
- Validates [[Crypto-to-AI pivot]] thesis

### Summary: Three compute paths

| Path | Chips | Ownership | Use case |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Google Cloud | TPUs | Rented | Flexible capacity |
| AWS | Trainium | Rented | Training, inference |
| Broadcom direct | TPUv7 | Owned | Core training clusters |

All roads lead to [[TSMC]] - TPUs and Trainium fabbed there.

## Strategic dependencies

- [[Google]] - Cloud partner, investor
- [[Amazon]] - Investor, AWS partnership
- [[Broadcom]] - TPU supplier

Less dependent on single partner than OpenAI-Microsoft.

## Agentic code moat

Anthropic is capturing the "agentic code orchestrator" niche:

- Claude Code - production agent, not autocomplete
- Agent SDK - platform for building agents
- Trust layer - enterprise won't let unreliable agents touch code
- 55% of enterprise AI spend is coding - largest category

See [[Long Anthropic]] for full thesis.

[[Long TSMC]]: Locking TSMC capacity via TPUs
[[AI hyperscalers]]: Validates AI capex
[[Model lab economics]]: Best-positioned lab for profitability

## Cowork competitive reception across verticals (Feb 2026)

FT (Anjli Raval, Feb 18): "Are Anthropic's new AI work tools game-changing for professionals?" Article maps the vertical-by-vertical reaction to Claude Cowork's January launch.

**Enterprise adoption:** [[Goldman Sachs]] working with Anthropic on AI agent to automate bank roles. [[Uber]], [[Netflix]], [[Salesforce]], [[Allianz]] also building on Claude. Guillaume Princen (Anthropic, head of digital native businesses): Cowork is "same powerful agent, but much more accessible."

**Market reaction:** Sparked investor worries about industry-specific AI companies. Wealth management share prices fell on disruption concerns. Employees across corporate offices began investigating alternatives.

**Legal vertical - specialists pushing back:**
- [[JPMorgan]]: Claude Cowork "just catching up with [[Harvey]] and [[RELX]]," lacks complete legal library
- [[Harvey]] and [[Legora]] use Anthropic/[[OpenAI]] models underneath but built proprietary tooling on top
- [[Legora]] CEO Max Junestrand dismissed plug-ins
- [[Luminance]]'s Harry Borovick: domain-specific tools increase in value as generalists expand
- Legal workers criticized Cowork's legal plug-in for using Wikipedia as a source

**Advertising - more vulnerable:**
- Generic models may pose MORE threat than vertical tools - enable clients to DIY, cutting out agencies
- [[WPP]] already uses Gemini/[[OpenAI]]/Anthropic under the hood
- Super Bowl 2026 showed AI takeover (Svedka Vodka ad)
- Bigger risk: clients skip agencies entirely

**Business planning - specialist defense:**
- [[Pigment]] CEO Eléonore Crespo: "Generalists are for play, but specialists are for work"
- Specialist providers succeed via unique data structures, workflow integration, governance/auditability
- [[Supercell]] (Finnish gaming): monthly performance report went from 3 hours → 5 minutes with AI analyst agent via [[Pigment]]. No mistakes, references provided.

Investment framing: The [[Horizontal vs vertical AI]] debate is now the central question for AI software investing. Legal and financial planning verticals appear defensible (deep data moats, regulatory requirements). Advertising/creative verticals more vulnerable to horizontal disruption.
