## Competitive position

| Miner | Hash rate | AI pivot status |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Marathon** | ~30 EH/s | Exploring |
| [[Core Scientific]] | ~20 EH/s | [[CoreWeave]] deal |
| [[Riot Platforms]] | ~20 EH/s | Minimal |
| [[TeraWulf]] | ~10 EH/s | [[Anthropic]] consortium |
| [[Hut 8]] | ~5 EH/s | [[Anthropic]] consortium |
| [[Cipher Mining]] | ~8 EH/s | [[Anthropic]] consortium |

Marathon is largest but hasn't announced major AI deal yet.

## AI opportunity

**Bull case:**
- Largest miner = most infrastructure to convert
- Power contracts valuable for AI
- Bitcoin mining margins compressing
- AI/HPC offers diversification

**Bear case:**
- No announced AI deals yet
- Competitors (Core Scientific, TeraWulf) moving faster
- Retrofit costs uncertain
- Management focused on Bitcoin
