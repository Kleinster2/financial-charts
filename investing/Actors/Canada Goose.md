# Canada Goose

CEO Dani Reiss (founder's grandson) stepped down 2023; replaced by Carrie Baker. Strategy shift: from "parka company" to "year-round luxury lifestyle brand." China ~20% of revenue, recovering.

## Financial performance

| Metric | FY23 | FY24 | FY25E |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Revenue (C$M) | 1,217 | 1,333 | ~1,350 |
| Revenue growth (CC) | +4% | +10% | +5% |
| Adj. EBIT (C$M) | ~180 | ~210 | ~200 |
| Adj. EBIT margin | ~15% | ~16% | ~15% |

Growth moderating after strong FY24. DTC transition largely complete.

## Channel mix

| Channel | % Revenue | Trend |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **DTC (retail + e-com)** | ~72% | Core strategy |
| **Wholesale** | ~28% | Deliberately shrinking |

DTC shift is the key margin driver — wholesale partners marked down product, diluting brand equity. Canada Goose has been pulling back wholesale to protect pricing.

## Category expansion

| Category | Status | Goal |
|----------|--------|------|
| Parkas/outerwear | ~70% of revenue | Still core |
| Lightweight/rain | Growing | Spring/fall relevance |
| Knitwear | Launched 2021 | Year-round play |
| Footwear | Launched 2022 | Early, mixed reviews |
| Eyewear | Licensed | Brand extension |

**The challenge:** Canada Goose = parkas in consumer minds. Expanding beyond creates relevance but risks brand dilution.

## Geographic breakdown

| Region | % Revenue | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| North America | ~50% | Stable |
| Asia Pacific | ~30% | China recovering |
| EMEA | ~20% | Growing |

China was ~20% of revenue at peak, declined during COVID/lockdowns, now recovering gradually.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- DTC at 72% = strong margin profile
- Brand equity in luxury outerwear unmatched
- Category expansion creates year-round relevance
- China recovery tailwind
- Stock -60% from 2021 highs, expectations reset
- Pricing power in core parkas

**Bear:**
- Parka dependency — seasonal, weather-dependent
- Category expansion unproven (footwear struggles)
- Warm winters = demand risk (climate change)
- CEO transition risk (Reiss → Baker)
- Growth deceleration (+5% CC)
- Luxury consumers shifting to "quiet luxury" (away from branded outerwear)
