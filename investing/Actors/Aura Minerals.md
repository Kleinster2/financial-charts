## Almas debenture + swap (October 2024)

Textbook example of EM corporate treasury strategy: access cheap local BRL funding, eliminate currency mismatch via swap.

### Debenture terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Issuer | Aura Almas Mineração S.A. |
| Amount | BRL 1.0B (~$175M) |
| Type | Simple, non-convertible, secured with surety guarantee |
| Maturity | 6 years |
| Rate | 100% DI + 1.60% p.a. (252 business days) |

**Deal evolution:** Originally sized at BRL 500M at CDI+1.75%. Oversubscribed order book allowed upsizing to BRL 1.0B at tighter spread (CDI+1.60%).

### Cross-currency swap with [[Itaú BBA]]

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Notional | BRL 1.0B |
| Aura receives | 100% DI + 1.60% (offsets debenture coupon) |
| Aura pays | USD/BRL exchange rate variation |
| Net effect | Synthetic USD debt at ~6.975% equivalent |
| Improvement | Final 6.975% vs initially anticipated 7.13% |

**Why this works:** Gold revenues are USD-denominated. Converting BRL debt to synthetic USD creates natural hedge — liability currency matches revenue currency.

## Financial strategy

### Debt philosophy

- Target leverage: 50-70% debt/total capex for project financing
- Focus on improving banking relationships and reducing cost of debt
- Balance sheet strengthening under CEO Barbosa

### FX/commodity approach

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Cross-currency swaps | Convert local debt to USD |
| Natural hedges | USD revenues vs synthetic USD debt |
| Gold exposure | Unhedged (benefits from spot price) |
| FX sensitivity | Costs in BRL/MXN; 2023 AISC would have been 7% lower at constant FX |

### Dividend policy

Quarterly dividend payments. One of highest dividend yields in mining industry since 2020. Maintains payouts while funding greenfield development.
