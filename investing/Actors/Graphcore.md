**Graphcore** — IPU architecture. UK AI chip hope. Struggling against NVIDIA. Exploring sale.

---

## Why Graphcore matters

UK's AI chip contender (cautionary tale):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | $2.8B peak (2020) |
| Raised | $700M+ |
| Founded | 2016 |
| Status | Struggling, sale talks |

---

## Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU)

**Different architecture:**
- Bulk Synchronous Parallel
- Massive parallelism
- On-chip SRAM
- Graph-based compute

---

## Rise and fall

**Timeline:**
- 2016: Founded in Bristol, UK
- 2020: $2.8B valuation
- 2021-22: NVIDIA dominance grows
- 2023-24: Layoffs, restructuring
- 2024-25: Sale discussions

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| CUDA ecosystem | Developers prefer NVIDIA |
| Funding environment | VC pullback |
| Customer traction | Limited enterprise wins |
| Competition | Cerebras, Groq, etc. |

---

## UK national interest

**Strategic concerns:**
- UK's main AI chip company
- Government interest in saving
- SoftBank/ARM potential buyer
- National security angle

---

## Potential acquirers

| Buyer | Logic |
|-------|-------|
| SoftBank/ARM | UK AI consolidation |
| Qualcomm | Edge AI |
| Strategic buyer | IP acquisition |

---

## Lessons learned

**Why Graphcore struggled:**
- NVIDIA ecosystem too strong
- Software moat underestimated
- Capital intensity of chip business
- Enterprise sales cycles long
