## Structure

The reverse IPO works by having [[Odontoprev]] — listed on [[B3]] since 2006 — absorb Bradesco Gestão de Saúde and rename itself Bradsaúde S.A. [[Odontoprev]]'s dental portfolio transfers to Mediservice so the holding operates as pure holdco. Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi (board chairman) called it the largest reverse IPO in Brazilian history — a R$7B entity absorbing R$30B of assets. Listing expected within 60 days pending shareholder votes (March at [[Bradesco]], April at [[Odontoprev]]) and [[ANS]] regulatory approval.

### Components

| Asset | Role | Scale |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Bradesco Saúde** | Flagship health insurer | R$41B revenue, 3.9M beneficiaries |
| **[[Odontoprev]]** | Dental plans (largest in Brazil) | 9M+ clients |
| **Mediservice** | Corporate health plans | Receives [[Odontoprev]] dental portfolio |
| **Atlântica Hospitais** | Hospital network | 3,600 beds |
| **Meu Doutor Novamed** | Primary care clinics | 35 clinics, 10+ years operating |
| **Orizon** | Healthcare AI/data platform | Claims analytics |
| **Croma Oncologia** | Cancer treatment JV | JV with Atlântica, [[Grupo Fleury]], Beneficência Portuguesa |
| **[[Grupo Fleury]]** (25% stake) | Diagnostics leader | Equity stake, not consolidated |

## Why it matters

**Unlocking hidden value.** Bradesco Saúde was generating billions in profit but buried inside [[Bradesco]]'s consolidated balance sheet — invisible to equity markets. Book value alone was R$15.5B. [[BTG Pactual]] estimates Bradsaúde could trade at 10-12x earnings vs [[Bradesco]]'s consolidated 7.6x, potentially adding R$0.80-1.50 per BBDC4 share.

**Verticalization play.** Not just an insurer spin-off — it's an integrated ecosystem covering insurance → primary care → hospitals → diagnostics → oncology → dental → AI analytics. The "irreplicable" scale (Marinelli's word) comes from owning the full care chain, not just the payer side.

**Market opportunity.** Brazil's supplementary health market: 52.9M beneficiaries across 649 operators as of Sep 2025. Extremely fragmented — no player controls even 8% market share. Bradesco Saúde alone holds ~11.6% by volume of services. The dental gap is the near-term growth vector: 18M Brazilians with health insurance have no dental coverage. TAM estimated at R$435B ($76B).

## Market reaction (Feb 27, 2026)

| Ticker | Move |
|--------|------|
| [[Odontoprev]] | **+26%** (R$12.85 → R$16.57 high) |
| [[Bradesco]] BBDC4 | **+3.7%** (outperformed [[Itaú Unibanco]], [[Banco do Brasil]], [[Santander Brasil]] — all red) |

## Competitive landscape

| Player | Beneficiaries | Market share (by volume) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| [[Unimed]] (cooperative) | — | ~34% |
| **Bradesco Saúde** | 3.9M | ~11.6% |
| [[SulAmérica]] | — | ~9.8% |
| [[Amil]] ([[UnitedHealth]]) | — | ~6.9% |
| [[Hapvida]]-[[NotreDame Intermédica]] | — | ~4.7% |

Bradsaúde's 13M beneficiary count (including dental) makes it the largest single corporate health entity, though the cooperative [[Unimed]] system remains dominant by volume.

## Bull case

- Value unlock: separate listing forces market to price health assets at healthcare multiples, not bank multiples
- Verticalization moat: no competitor owns the full insurance-to-hospital-to-diagnostics chain at this scale
- Dental white space: 18M insured Brazilians without dental = immediate cross-sell
- No dilution: no capital raise, no share offering — pure structural value creation
- [[Bradesco]] retains 91% — aligned long-term, no dump risk

## Bear case

- Healthcare regulation risk: [[ANS]] price controls, coverage mandates squeeze margins
- Medical loss ratios: Brazilian health insurers face persistent cost pressure (40% readjustment demands per Reddit anecdote)
- Execution risk: integrating 7+ entities with different cultures under one holdco
- Minority squeeze: 8.65% float is tiny — liquidity risk until [[Bradesco]] sells down
- [[Hapvida]]-[[NotreDame Intermédica]] proved vertical integration is hard (stock -70% post-merger)
