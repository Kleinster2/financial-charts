## $920M SiPho/SiGe buildout

Total investment: $920M (including additional $270M announced Q4 2025) for silicon photonics capacity and next-gen capabilities. Full qualification targeted Q4 2026, enabling >5x the Q4 2025 annualized wafer run-rate.

Over 70% of capacity presold through 2028, backed by customer prepayments. This is the highest-conviction capex cycle in the specialty foundry space — customers are prepaying for capacity years ahead.

## Investment case

Bull:
- SiPho demand exploding (AI data center optical connectivity)
- 70%+ capacity presold through 2028
- Specialty niches immune to leading-edge competition
- Record margins expanding

Bear:
- Intel NM contract dispute creates uncertainty
- Heavy capex cycle ($920M) execution risk
- Customer concentration in SiPho
- Stock sold off 7.4% on earnings day despite beat
