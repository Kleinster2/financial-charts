## Why V.tal matters

Brazil's fiber backbone connecting DCs to the world:

- **Scale**: 450,000+ km fiber throughout all Brazilian regions
- **Submarine**: 26,000 km connecting Brazil to Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, US, Bermuda
- **Neutral wholesale**: Open access model (though Oi relationship creates tension)
- **DC expansion**: Launching Tecto with $1B investment

## Ownership

| Investor | Stake | Date | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| [[BTG Pactual]] | Controlling | 2021 | Acquired [[Oi]] fiber via Infrastructure Fund II |
| [[GIC]] | 9.9% | Oct 2021 | Singapore sovereign fund |
| [[CPP Investments]] | 9.5% | Nov 2022 | R$2.5B (~C$625M) |

[[GlobeNet]] (submarine cable operator) merged into V.tal in 2022 — BTG consolidated both assets.

**2021 deal**: Oi sold 57.9% of fiber unit to GlobeNet + GIC at R$20B ($3.5B) enterprise value.

## Data center business

**Tecto Data Centers** (new subsidiary):
- $1B initial investment
- Oversees existing + future DCs
- Brazil and Colombia operations
- Expansion to Porto Alegre, Santana de Parnaíba (SP)
- All DCs connected to V.tal's fiber network

---

## Corporate restructuring (2024-25)

V.tal entering new cycle — potentially three independent companies:
1. Neutral Network (fiber wholesale)
2. Wholesale markets
3. Data Centers (Tecto)

**Oi Fibra acquisition**: V.tal close to acquiring Oi's retail fiber customers (ClientCo) — would end neutral wholesale positioning as competitors reluctant to lease from Oi-affiliated network.
