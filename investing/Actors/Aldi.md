## History

### Founding

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 1946 (post-WWII) |
| Founders | Karl and Theo Albrecht |
| Origin | Essen, [[Germany]] (working-class mining neighborhood) |
| Name | "Albrecht" + "Discount" = Aldi |

### The split (early 1960s)

The brothers had different management styles and split the company:

| Entity | Founder | Territory | Key asset |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Aldi Süd** | Karl Albrecht | Southern [[Germany]] | "Aldi" brand in US, [[UK]], [[Australia]], [[China]] |
| **Aldi Nord** | Theo Albrecht | Northern [[Germany]] | [[Trader Joe's]] (acquired 1979) |

**Important:** Aldi and Trader Joe's share lineage but are separately owned by different branches of the Albrecht family.

### US expansion

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1976 | First US store (Iowa) |
| 2011 | First NYC store (Queens) |
| 2013 | Accelerated expansion (Lidl threat) |
| 2015 | Jason Hart becomes US CEO; $5B investment |
| 2024 | Acquired Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket |
| 2024 | $9B investment for 800 new stores announced |
| 2025 | Brooklyn flagship opening; Times Square store announced |

## Business model

### The discount formula

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Limited selection** | One type of rice, one type of beans — fewer SKUs = lower costs |
| **Private-label dominance** | 90%+ store brands — no advertising/marketing costs |
| **No frills** | No music, no decor, products in shipping boxes |
| **Customer labor** | Quarter deposit for carts, bag your own groceries |
| **Efficient workforce** | Fewer workers, paid 18% above retail average, measured on speed |

### The "Aisle of Shame"

Famous middle aisle with rotating non-food items at steep discounts:
- Pizza ovens for $99
- Sequin pants for $16.99
- Random home goods, seasonal items
- Higher-margin impulse buys

Fans post finds on [[Reddit]] (r/aldi) and Facebook groups (4M+ members).

### Private-label strategy

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Copycat products | Benton's cookies vs Oreos (same look, half the price) |
| Multiple barcodes | Faster checkout scanning |
| Supplier efficiency | 1-2 sizes per product vs 10+ at other chains |

## Competitive position

### US grocery landscape

| Chain | 2024 Revenue | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| [[Walmart]] | ~$450B (grocery) | #1 by far |
| Kroger | ~$150B | Traditional supermarket |
| [[Costco]] | ~$100B (grocery) | Membership/bulk |
| **Aldi** | **$29B** | Fastest-growing by store count |
| [[Trader Joe's]] | ~$20B | Sister company (Aldi Nord) |
| Lidl (US) | ~$3B | Struggling in US |

### US foot traffic (2024)

| Chain | Visits | vs Aldi |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Kroger | 1.0B | 1.1x |
| Publix | 1.0B | 1.1x |
| **Aldi** | **924M** | — |
| Safeway | 821M | 0.9x |
| H-E-B | 663M | 0.7x |
| [[Trader Joe's]] | 387M | 0.4x |
| Whole Foods | 339M | 0.4x |
| Lidl | 63M | 0.07x |

**Key insight:** Aldi draws 2.4x the foot traffic of sister chain Trader Joe's despite similar private-label model. Lidl's 63M visits confirms its US struggle — 15x less traffic than Aldi.

### Aldi vs Trader Joe's

|--|------|--------------|

### Aldi vs Lidl

## Challenges

### [[Europe]]: Lidl threat

- Lidl gaining market share in [[Germany]]
- May 2025: Lidl announced permanent price cuts on 500+ products
- German consumer sentiment turning against Aldi:
  - Worker conditions concerns
  - Albrecht family wealth criticism
  - Supplier pressure allegations

### Corporate structure

- Aldi Süd now **3x size of Aldi Nord**
- Merger talks complicated by size disparity
- Nord heirs unlikely to accept minority stake
- Joint online store (2021) shut down Sept 2025 — couldn't compete with [[Amazon]]

### Mondelez lawsuit

- Accused of "blatantly" copying Oreo products
- Seven products specifically cited
- Settlement discussions ongoing (as of Jan 2026)

## Investment relevance

**Not directly investable** (private), but impacts:

| Company | Ticker | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| [[Walmart]] | WMT | Direct competitor for price-conscious shoppers |
| [[Target]] | TGT | Competing for suburban grocery share |
| Albertsons | ACI | Acquired Winn-Dixie/Harveys from Aldi |
| Kroger | KR | Traditional grocery under pressure |
| [[Mondelez]] | MDLZ | Lawsuit over Oreo knockoffs |
| [[Costco]] | COST | Different model but overlapping customers |

**Thesis implications:**
- Aldi's growth = pressure on traditional grocery margins
- Private-label trend benefits Aldi model
- If Aldi stumbles in US, benefits incumbents
- Lidl's European gains don't translate to US (yet)
