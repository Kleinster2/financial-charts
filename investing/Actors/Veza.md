## What Veza does

Veza provides identity security — understanding and controlling who (and what) has access to data, applications, and systems. The platform manages:

- **Human identities** — Employee access rights
- **Machine identities** — Service accounts, APIs
- **AI identities** — [[AI agents]] and their permissions

**Core technology:** Patented Access Graph that maps all access relationships across the enterprise, enabling:
- Identity governance and administration (IGA)
- Privileged access monitoring
- SaaS access security
- Non-human identity management
- Cloud access management

---

## Why identity security matters now

As enterprises deploy [[AI agents]] that can take autonomous actions, identity management becomes critical:
- What can this AI agent access?
- What actions is it authorized to take?
- How do we audit what it did?

Traditional IAM systems weren't built for non-human identities at scale. Veza's modern, API-first approach handles both human and machine identities.

## Customers

Global enterprises including:
- [[Wynn Resorts]]
- [[Expedia]]
- [[Blackstone]]

Focus on banking, hospitality, and FMCG sectors.

## ServiceNow acquisition (Dec 2025)

**Deal terms:**
- Price: >$1B (undisclosed, per reports)
- Announced: December 2, 2025
- Status: Pending regulatory approval

**Strategic rationale:**
- [[ServiceNow]]'s first serious entry into IAM/IGA market
- Extends Security and Risk portfolio
- Critical for [[AI agents]] — must control what agents can access
- Complements [[Armis]] (device security) and [[Moveworks]] (AI assistant)

Amit Zavery (ServiceNow President) highlighted AI agent security as key driver — as more agents perform autonomous actions, controlling their permissions is essential.
