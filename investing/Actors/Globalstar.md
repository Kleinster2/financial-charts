# Globalstar

Satellite communications company and [[Apple]]'s exclusive partner for iPhone Emergency SOS via satellite. Transitioning from legacy satellite operator to capacity supplier for Apple's direct-to-device ecosystem. Also owns valuable Band 53/n53 licensed spectrum for terrestrial private networks.

---

## Why it matters

Apple dependency defines the story. 85% of network capacity allocated to Apple under expanded partnership. The $1.5B Apple investment transformed Globalstar from a struggling LEO operator into a strategic infrastructure play. Band 53 spectrum provides optionality beyond Apple.

## Satellite constellation

| Generation | Satellites | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Current fleet | 31 operational | LEO |
| New order (MDA) | 17 satellites ($327M contract) | Building, options for +9 more |
| Total planned | Up to 57 | SpaceX launching |
| HIBLEO-XL-1 | Next-gen filing | New orbital shells + frequency bands |

**MDA (Canada)** building next-gen satellites at ~$11.4M each. [[SpaceX]] handling launches.

**HIBLEO-XL-1** (announced Sep 2025): Next-era mobile satellite system filing — new satellites, orbital shells, and frequency bands for expanded capacity and advanced capabilities.

## Band 53/n53 spectrum

Globalstar owns rare licensed mid-band spectrum at 2.4 GHz (2483.5-2495 MHz, 11.5 MHz bandwidth). FCC-licensed since 2016, now approved in 12 nations (870M+ people).

**Advantages over alternatives:**
- No interference (unlike Wi-Fi)
- Greater range than Wi-Fi
- No SAS requirement (unlike CBRS) — lower costs
- Licensed = guaranteed quality

**Partnerships:**
| Partner | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| Boingo Wireless (Feb 2026) | Private 5G via XCOM RAN |
| Conekt.ai (Oct 2025) | IoT/private network orchestration |
| Skydio (Dec 2025) | Drone operations on Band n53 |
| Hawk Networks | Spectrum-as-a-service platform |
| Global Telecom / Alliance | CBRS carrier aggregation |

## Commercial IoT

- Average subscribers: 543K (+6% YoY)
- Gross activations: +40% YoY (Q3 2025)
- Total units: +100% YoY
- IoT equipment revenue: +60% YoY (Q3 2025)

## Revenue breakdown (Q3 2025)

| Segment | Revenue |
|---------|---------|
| Service revenue | $69.6M |
| Subscriber equipment | $4.2M |
| **Total** | **$73.8M** |

Growth driven by wholesale capacity services (Apple) and Commercial IoT expansion.

## Competitive landscape

| Competitor | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| [[Starlink]] | Dominant LEO broadband; potential acquirer? |
| [[AST SpaceMobile]] | Direct-to-cell broadband (different market) |
| [[Amazon]] LEO | Enterprise fixed broadband |
| Iridium | Legacy satellite voice/data |

**Deutsche Bank** initiated coverage Dec 2025 with Hold rating, $62 PT. Notes Globalstar's spectrum gained "material" strategic worth after EchoStar-SpaceX arrangement.

**Acquisition rumors:** Reports of Globalstar exploring a sale. Some analysts speculate [[SpaceX]] could acquire Globalstar to secure Apple's business.

## Recent stock action

Feb 4, 2026: GSAT fell ~7% alongside [[AST SpaceMobile]] (-11%) after AT&T announced Amazon LEO satellite partnership. Market feared big-tech vertical integration threat to smaller satellite players. Globalstar less directly affected (Apple relationship, not AT&T), but sentiment dragged sector.

---

## Risks

- **Apple concentration** — 85% of capacity to one customer; Apple has leverage
- **Profitability** — still EPS-negative despite revenue growth
- **Capital intensity** — $486M capex in 9 months; constellation refresh is expensive
- **Competition** — Starlink/Amazon have vastly more capital
- **Execution** — must deliver next-gen constellation on schedule
- **Valuation** — 46x EV/EBITDA for a company still losing money
