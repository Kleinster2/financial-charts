# Gogoro

Taiwan's battery-swap infrastructure company for electric two-wheelers. Founded 2011 by Horace Luke (ex-HTC, ex-[[Microsoft]]/Xbox) and Matt Taylor (ex-HTC CTO). NASDAQ: GGR (via SPAC, Apr 2022). Built a network of swap stations more common than gas stations in Taiwan's major cities — 648K+ subscribers, 1M+ batteries, 90% of Taiwan's EV scooters run on Gogoro's network. Revenue $310M (2024), still loss-making but expects battery-swap business to reach profitability in 2026.

## What makes Gogoro, Gogoro

The bet is that **Gogoro is an energy platform, not a scooter company.**

1. **Network lock-in** — 5 of top 6 Taiwan scooter makers use Gogoro batteries/drivetrains. Once riders subscribe, switching cost is high (different battery format, different stations)
2. **Recurring revenue** — monthly subscription (~$30) for unlimited swaps. [[SaaS]]-like economics. Energy revenue now exceeds vehicle sales (Q4 2024 milestone)
3. **Infrastructure density** — more swap stations than gas stations in Taiwan's major cities. 6-second swap vs. hours of charging
4. **Virtual power plant** — swap stations double as distributed energy storage. Grid balancing potential as battery network grows
5. **Platform extensibility** — same battery format can power delivery robots, portable power, grid storage. Not just scooters

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Battery swap rev | Net loss | Subscribers |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| 2023 | ~$340M | — | — | ~600K |
| 2024 | ~$310M | Growing | — | ~640K |
| Q2 2025 | $77.6M (-11% YoY) | $37.6M (+8.5% YoY) | -$14.9M | 648K+ |
| Q3 2025 | $77.6M (-11% YoY) | Growing | -$14.9M | — |

**Key dynamic:** Hardware revenue declining (-25.5% YoY, vehicle volume -43.7%) but swap service revenue growing (+8.5%). The company is transitioning from selling scooters to operating an energy network. Gross margin improved to 12.2% (vs. 5.4% prior year).

**Path to profitability:** Gogoro expects battery-swap business to reach non-IFRS profitability and deliver non-IFRS net income in 2026.

## Founder: Horace Luke

Born in Hong Kong, raised in US, based in Taiwan. Spent 9 years at [[Microsoft]] — designer of Xbox and Windows XP. Then served as HTC's Chief Innovation Officer / Chief Creative Officer. Left HTC in 2011 to found Gogoro. Pitched battery-swap to investors and OEMs who told him it was impossible. Built the network anyway.

**Sep 2024:** Luke stepped down as CEO amid subsidy fraud allegations. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs cleared the company in Oct 2024 (insufficient evidence of violations). Leadership transition ongoing.

## The Yadea JV

[[Yadea]] + Gogoro + Dachangjiang Group (DCJ) formed a **$50M joint venture** to bring battery-swapping to [[China]]. Yadea builds vehicles using Gogoro Network batteries, drivetrains, and controllers.

**Why it matters:** [[China]] has 300M+ electric two-wheelers. If even a fraction adopt battery-swap, it dwarfs Taiwan's 648K subscriber base. But execution risk is high — [[China]] has its own battery-swap players and regulatory preferences for domestic solutions.

## Global expansion

| Market | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Taiwan** | Dominant (90% of EV scooters) |
| **[[China]]** | JV with Yadea/DCJ ($50M) |
| **[[India]]** | Pilot |
| **Indonesia** | Pilot |
| **Philippines** | Pilot |
| **Singapore** | Pilot |
| **Israel** | Pilot |
| **[[Germany]]** | Pilot |

No market outside Taiwan has achieved meaningful scale yet.

## Bull / Bear

| Bull | Bear |
|------|------|
| Platform, not product — recurring energy revenue | $50M market cap = micro-cap, near-zero liquidity |
| 90% Taiwan EV scooter lock-in | Revenue declining (-11% YoY) |
| Yadea JV could unlock [[China]]'s 300M two-wheelers | [[China]] JV unproven; domestic alternatives exist |
| Expects profitability 2026 | Still losing ~$15M/quarter |
| Energy > vehicle revenue (transition working) | Vehicle volume -44% — hardware business collapsing |
| 648K subscribers, high retention | Taiwan is a small market (24M people) |
| Potential 100:1 reverse split to maintain listing | Reverse split signals distress, not strength |

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Micro-cap** | $50M market cap; potential delisting risk (hence reverse split authorization) |
| **Taiwan-only at scale** | No international market has traction |
| **CEO departure** | Founder left amid scandal; cleared but leadership uncertain |
| **[[China]] competition** | Domestic swap players may be preferred by regulators |
| **Hardware collapse** | Vehicle sales -44%; if swap revenue can't offset, losses widen |
