**PicPay** (NASDAQ: PICS) — Brazil's third-largest digital bank by clients. 67M accounts. Owned by the [[Batista family]] ([[JBS]]). Pivoted from digital wallet to credit-focused fintech after [[Pix]] commoditized payments. IPO'd Jan 29, 2026 at $19/share raising ~$434M — first Brazilian IPO since [[Nubank]] (2021). Stock down ~24% post-IPO ($14.46 as of Feb 12); its weak debut pressured [[Agibank]]'s subsequent listing.

However, stock declined ~24% in first two weeks of trading ($14.46 as of Feb 12), souring sentiment for subsequent Brazilian listings (directly pressured [[Agibank]]'s IPO downsizing).

## Price

*[[Nubank|NU]] · [[StoneCo|STNE]] · [[PagSeguro|PAGS]]*

*PICS down ~24% since Jan 29 IPO — worst of the US-listed Brazilian fintechs. STNE rallied +8% before the Feb 12 broad selloff. NU and PAGS held in a -5% to -10% range. The new listing is clearly underperforming the incumbents.*

## Business model evolution

**Phase 1 (2012-2020): Digital wallet**

PicPay started as a peer-to-peer payment app when wire transfers weren't widely available in Brazil. Growth accelerated during Covid as Brazilians adopted digital banking.

**Phase 2 (2020-present): Credit-focused fintech**

The arrival of Brazil's central bank-powered [[Pix]] transfer system in 2020 eliminated PicPay's competitive advantage — every bank now offers instant free transfers. PicPay pivoted to credit:

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Credit products | Personal loans, credit cards, BNPL |
| Distribution | Bank via app, retail banking |
| Key acquisition | [[Banco Original SA]] retail operations (2024) |
| [[Insurance]] | Acquiring [[Kovr Participacoes SA]] (from failed [[Banco Master]]) |

> **BTG analyst:** "Although PicPay has a comprehensive ecosystem and was initially launched as an asset-light digital wallet, credit is becoming increasingly relevant to its business model, resembling that of digital banks like Nubank." — Eduardo Rosman, Sept 2025

## IPO (January 29, 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchange | NASDAQ |
| Ticker | PICS |
| Shares sold | 22.86M Class A |
| Price | $19/share (top of $16-19 range) |
| Amount raised | ~$434M ($500M w/ overallotment) |
| Valuation | ~$2.5B |
| Underwriters | [[Citigroup]], [[BofA Securities]], [[RBC Capital Markets]] |
| Use of proceeds | Credit expansion, Kovr acquisition |
| Significance | First Brazilian IPO since [[Nubank]] (2021) |
| Post-IPO performance | Down ~24% ($14.46 as of Feb 12) |

**Corporate structure:** Listed as PicS N.V. (formerly PicPay Holdings). Dual-class structure — [[Batista family]] retains control through supervoting shares.

**Post-IPO impact:** The ~20% decline directly caused [[Agibank]] to slash its IPO size by >50% hours before pricing (Feb 10). Bloomberg called it a "bumpy comeback" for Brazilian fintechs.

## Kovr acquisition

PicPay agreed to acquire [[Kovr Participacoes SA]], an insurance company previously owned by the now-failed [[Banco Master]]. The deal:

- Happened after PicPay's own executives bought it from Banco Master
- Pending regulatory approval
- Could be affected by Banco Master's ongoing liquidation
- IPO proceeds would help finance the deal

| [[Nubank]] | 100M+ | Brazil, [[Mexico]], Colombia | Nubank multi-country; PicPay Brazil-only |
| [[Mercado Libre]] | 70M+ fintech | LatAm-wide | MELI has e-commerce flywheel |
| **PicPay** | 67M | Brazil only | Credit-first, insurance expansion |

**Key weakness:** Unlike Nubank and Mercado Libre, PicPay operates only in Brazil — no geographic diversification.
