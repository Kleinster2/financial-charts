## Business model evolution

**Phase 1 (2012-2020): Digital wallet**

PicPay started as a peer-to-peer payment app when wire transfers weren't widely available in Brazil. Growth accelerated during Covid as Brazilians adopted digital banking.

**Phase 2 (2020-present): Credit-focused fintech**

The arrival of Brazil's central bank-powered [[Pix]] transfer system in 2020 eliminated PicPay's competitive advantage — every bank now offers instant free transfers. PicPay pivoted to credit:

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Credit products | Personal loans, credit cards, BNPL |
| Distribution | Bank via app, retail banking |
| Key acquisition | [[Banco Original SA]] retail operations (2024) |
| Insurance | Acquiring [[Kovr Participacoes SA]] (from failed [[Banco Master]]) |

> **BTG analyst:** "Although PicPay has a comprehensive ecosystem and was initially launched as an asset-light digital wallet, credit is becoming increasingly relevant to its business model, resembling that of digital banks like Nubank." — Eduardo Rosman, Sept 2025

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Clients | Geographic scope | PicPay difference |
|------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| [[Nubank]] | 100M+ | Brazil, Mexico, Colombia | Nubank multi-country; PicPay Brazil-only |
| [[Mercado Libre]] | 70M+ fintech | LatAm-wide | MELI has e-commerce flywheel |
| **PicPay** | 67M | Brazil only | Credit-first, insurance expansion |

**Key weakness:** Unlike Nubank and Mercado Libre, PicPay operates only in Brazil — no geographic diversification.
