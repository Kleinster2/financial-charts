## Key theses & frameworks

### Petrodollar decline
Gromen's central thesis: the [[petrodollar]] system — where [[oil]]-producing nations recycle dollar surpluses into [[U.S. Treasuries]] — is breaking down. Key arguments:
- [[China]]'s rising role as the world's largest [[oil]] importer means more [[oil]] trade is settling in [[yuan]] and other non-dollar currencies
- [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[OPEC]] are diversifying away from exclusive dollar pricing
- The [[Russia]]-[[Ukraine]] war and freezing of Russian reserves accelerated this shift
- Without [[petrodollar]] recycling, the US loses a key source of [[Treasury]] demand

### Fiscal dominance
Argues the [[U.S.]] has entered a regime of "[[fiscal dominance]]" where:
- [[Federal debt]]-to-[[GDP]] and interest expense are so large that the [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] cannot raise rates enough to fight [[inflation]] without triggering a [[fiscal crisis]]
- The [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] will ultimately be forced to monetize [[debt]] ([[yield curve control]] or equivalent)
- This is structurally bullish for [[gold]], [[commodities]], and real assets; bearish for [[bonds]] in real terms
- The US is on a path similar to 1940s-style [[financial repression]]

### Energy as the master resource
Gromen emphasizes [[energy]] as the foundation of economic output:
- [[Oil]] and [[natural gas]] underpin global trade and manufacturing
- Nations with energy security ([[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[UAE]]) have structural leverage
- The [[energy transition]] creates inflationary pressure in the medium term as capex requirements are enormous
- [[Gold]]/[[oil]] ratio is a key indicator of dollar system stress

### The "Forest for the Trees" framework
Named after the firm: Gromen focuses on connecting macro dots that specialists miss — linking [[energy]] markets, [[fiscal policy]], [[central banking]], and [[geopolitics]] into a unified framework. He argues most analysts miss the big picture by focusing on trees (individual data points) rather than the forest (structural macro shifts).

## Track record

### Hits
- Gold bull call: Has been bullish on [[gold]] since well before the 2019-2024 run from ~$1,300 to $2,400+
- Petrodollar erosion: [[Saudi Arabia]] began accepting non-dollar payment for [[oil]]; [[BRICS]] explored alternative settlement
- Fiscal dominance recognition: This framework has gone from fringe to mainstream as US debt/GDP exceeded 120% and interest expense topped $1T
- Energy supply constraints: Correctly identified underinvestment in [[fossil fuel]] capex as a structural inflation driver

### Misses / debates
- Dollar collapse timing: The dollar has remained far stronger than his framework would suggest; DXY has held up despite fiscal deterioration
- Treasury market resilience: Despite his structural bearishness, Treasuries have continued to find buyers
- Recession timing: Some of his more dire fiscal crisis scenarios haven't played out on the timeline he suggested
- Crypto skepticism → adoption: Was initially less enthusiastic about [[Bitcoin]] as a dollar hedge vs. [[gold]], though has warmed to it

## Style & influence

Gromen is a systems thinker who excels at connecting disparate macro trends into a coherent narrative. He's a prolific podcast guest and his weekly FFTT research notes have a dedicated institutional following. His style is conversational but data-rich, often using historical analogies (1940s financial repression, 1970s energy crisis) to frame current dynamics. He's part of the "macro Twitter" ecosystem alongside [[Zoltan Pozsar]], [[Russell Napier]], and [[Lyn Alden]].
