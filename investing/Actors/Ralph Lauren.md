# Ralph Lauren

**American luxury lifestyle brand** — quintessential "elevated American" positioning. FY25 revenue $7.1B (+6%, +8% CC), AUR (average unit retail) +12% — successfully executing brand elevation strategy. CEO Patrice Louvet (since 2017) transformed from discounting-dependent wholesale model to full-price DTC-led luxury house. 59% gross margin. Stock at all-time highs (up 3x since 2020 lows).

## Brand elevation strategy

| Lever | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUR** | +12% — less discounting, higher price points |
| **Wholesale exits** | Pulled from off-price/discount channels |
| **DTC growth** | Now ~60% of revenue (up from ~50%) |
| **Full-price mix** | Improving every quarter |
| **Luxury positioning** | Competing with European houses, not [[Gap]] |

Key insight: Ralph Lauren was a $10B+ revenue company at peak (2015) that deliberately shrank to fix the brand. Now growing again from a healthier base.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Brand elevation working (AUR +12%, margins expanding)
- Stock at ATH but still ~18x PE (reasonable for luxury)
- DTC at 60% with room to grow
- [[Europe]]/[[Asia]] underpenetrated
- Gross margin approaching luxury peers (59% vs 65%+ for [[Hermès]])
- Founder still involved as creative force

**Bear:**
- Founder risk — Ralph Lauren is 84, brand identity tied to him
- Accessible luxury segment under pressure (dupe economy)
- North America growth slower (+5% vs +10%+ internationally)
- Competition from European luxury houses moving casual
- Brand elevation has limits — not perceived as "true luxury" by ultra-HNW
- FY25 growth may be peak as comps toughen
