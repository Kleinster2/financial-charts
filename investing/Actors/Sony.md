## The entertainment transformation

A decade ago, entertainment was ~30% of Sony's revenue. By 2024, it reached ~60%. CEO [[Hiroki Totoki]] architected the pivot after returning to HQ in 2013 during "a very severe time" — weak financials, talent exodus. The strategic logic:

- **Consumer electronics in the digital era**: hard to differentiate products → invites low-cost entrants (first Korea, then China)
- **Chinese competition**: massive domestic market enables volume-and-price competition Sony can't match
- **Content is defensible**: unique IP with recurring value, not commoditized by digitalization
- **Three pillars**: gaming (largest), music (growing), film (significant)

### Gaming ([[PlayStation]])

[[PlayStation]] is the largest entertainment segment. Current gen: PS5 (60M+ installed base). Key franchises: God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Helldivers. Platform strategy: "best place to play" (users) and "best place to publish" (developers) — strong first-party studios plus deep third-party publisher relationships.

**PS6 delay risk**: Bloomberg (Feb 2025) reported Sony considering pushing PS6 debut to 2028-2029 due to [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory costs]] at 35%+ of console BOM. Traditional hardware-loss model becomes unsustainable at those levels.

### Music

Sony has made major investments in music catalogs, financed in partnership with [[Apollo]]. Music catalogs are low-risk, low-return assets that fit Apollo's long-dated [[Private credit|private credit]] model. [[Hiroki Totoki|Totoki]]: "Each capital resource has a different risk appetite and time horizon... music capital is relatively low risk and low return... that really fits private credit."

### Film & anime

Sony Pictures active in film production, with [[Netflix]] distribution deals for scale. Anime has gone global: simultaneous worldwide streaming distribution expanded the market and reduced piracy risk. Japan's anime industry is a significant cultural export, and Sony is well-positioned through its distribution infrastructure.

## Sony Semiconductor Solutions

Separate business — **#1 global image sensor supplier:**
- Apple iPhone primary supplier
- [[Automotive]] sensors growing
- Not directly memory-related
- Benefits from smartphone volume but also exposed to memory-driven demand softness

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Entertainment transformation working — 60% revenue, defensible IP moats
- PlayStation ecosystem stickiness (hardware + software + services)
- Music catalog investments with patient capital ([[Apollo]])
- Image sensor dominance (#1 globally, Apple relationship)
- Part of broader [[Japan corporate governance revolution]] — focused, restructuring portfolio

**Bear:**
- PS6 delay risk from [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory costs]]
- Consumer electronics segment under structural pressure from Chinese competitors
- Gaming competition from PC, mobile, cloud
- Memory shortage could compress hardware margins indefinitely
- Yen weakness affects reported earnings for foreign investors
