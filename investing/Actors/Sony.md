**Sony** — PlayStation maker considering next-gen delay. Also major image sensor supplier (different business).

## Why Sony matters for this vault

Sony spans both sides — memory victim (PlayStation) and semiconductor supplier (image sensors):

| Segment | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| Gaming | PS6 delay risk from memory costs |
| Semiconductors | #1 image sensors (separate dynamic) |

## PlayStation memory crisis

**Next-gen delay consideration:**
- Sony reportedly weighing PS6 delay past 2028
- Memory costs 35%+ of console BOM by 2026
- Current pricing model unsustainable

**The math:**
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Memory % of BOM | 35%+ projected |
| Price increase | Would need significant hike |
| Traditional model | Sell hardware at loss, profit on games |
| Problem | Losses too deep with current memory prices |

## Comparison to Nintendo

| Company | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| [[Nintendo]] | Launched Switch 2, eating margin |
| **Sony** | Considering delay |
| Microsoft | Also considering delay |

Sony may wait for memory normalization (2028+).

## Sony Semiconductor Solutions

**Separate business — image sensors:**
- #1 global image sensor supplier
- Apple iPhone main supplier
- Automotive sensors growing
- Not directly memory-related

**Relevance to vault:**
- Supplies smartphone cameras
- Benefits from smartphone volume
- But smartphone demand hurt by memory costs too

## Gaming segment details

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current gen | PlayStation 5 |
| Next gen | PS6 (delayed?) |
| Installed base | 60M+ PS5 |
| Business model | Hardware loss, software profit |

---

## Investment case

**Gaming bear:**
- Memory costs delay next-gen
- Hardware margins impossible
- Competition from PC, mobile

**Gaming bull:**
- Software/services margins strong
- Can wait out memory shortage
- Strong IP and ecosystem

**Semiconductor bull:**
- Image sensor dominance
- Apple relationship
- Automotive growth
