## Strategic direction: AI-native learning

Riparbelli (FT, Feb 2026) frames two phases: (1) replace cameras with AI for faster/cheaper video — the current business; (2) reinvent video as an **interactive, personalized format** — the "$100B question." In phase 2, training videos aren't broadcast — they adapt per learner, include AI tutors for Q&A, and role-play comprehension checks. Enterprise L&D is the beachhead.
