RELX — global information analytics company. Owns LexisNexis (legal), Elsevier (scientific publishing), LexisNexis Risk Solutions (insurance/financial risk), and RX (exhibitions). £9.6B revenue, ~£70B market cap. The incumbent that AI legal startups are trying to displace — and so far, defending well.

## Business segments

| Segment | Focus | Key brands |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Risk | Insurance, financial, identity analytics | LexisNexis Risk Solutions |
| STM | Scientific publishing, research tools | [[Elsevier]], ScienceDirect, Scopus |
| Legal | Legal research, analytics, workflow tools | LexisNexis, Butterworths, JurisClasseur |
| Exhibitions | Trade shows, events | RX (formerly Reed Exhibitions) |

All four segments delivered revenue and profit growth in 2025, with profit growth 1-3 pts ahead of revenue growth in each.

## The data moat

RELX's core defensibility: proprietary content and data at scale.

- LexisNexis legal database: 119 billion documents and records
- 85%+ of revenues are electronic/digital
- Analytics now ~60% of revenue (up from ~2% pre-pandemic)
- Decades of structured legal, scientific, and risk data that can't be replicated

CEO Engstrom (Feb 2026): AI is "enabling us to add more value to customers" — positioned as a tailwind, not a threat. RELX embeds AI into existing products rather than selling AI as a standalone.

## AI strategy — legal

LexisNexis launched Protégé (Q4 2025) — personalized AI-powered legal assistant integrating LexisNexis+ AI in a single platform.

Jan 2026: launched hundreds of pre-built, configurable workflows for disputes, case strategy, and other legal processes — deployable out-of-box or tailored with firm-specific guidance.

JPMorgan (Feb 2026): assessed that [[Anthropic]]'s Claude Cowork "is just catching up" with [[Harvey]] and RELX. Noted Cowork lacks the complete legal library that RELX has built over decades.

## Competitive position

| Threat | RELX response |
|--------|---------------|
| [[Harvey]] | Faster AI iteration, but lacks RELX's complete law library and 119B document corpus |
| [[Anthropic]] (Cowork) | Horizontal plug-ins, but JPMorgan says unlikely to match RELX's agentic solutions |
| [[Legora]] | Niche legal AI, built on same LLMs | 
| [[Thomson Reuters]] (Westlaw) | Direct incumbent competitor — similar data moat |
| Open access movement | Threat to Elsevier's publishing model |

RELX's advantage over AI startups: the data. AI models need training data and retrieval corpora — RELX owns the corpus. Startups build on top of it (Harvey integrates with LexisNexis).

## 2025 financials

| Metric | 2025 | 2024 | Growth |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Revenue | £9,590M | £9,434M | +7% underlying |
| Adj. operating profit | £3,342M | £3,199M | +9% underlying |
| Adj. operating margin | 34.8% | 33.9% | +0.9pp |
| Adj. EPS | 128.5p | 120.1p | +10% cc |
| Reported EPS | 112.6p | 103.6p | +9% |
| EBITDA | £3,846M | £3,724M | |
| Net debt | £7,201M | £6,563M | |
| Cash flow conversion | 99% | — | |

2026 outlook: "another year of strong underlying growth in revenue and adjusted operating profit."

## Investment case

Bull:
- Irreplaceable data moat — 119B documents, decades of structured legal/scientific/risk data
- AI is a tailwind: RELX embeds it into products, charges more, expands margins
- 34.8% operating margin expanding — cost growth managed below revenue growth
- JPMorgan endorsement vs horizontal AI threats
- Steady compounder: 7% revenue growth, 10% EPS growth, £1.5B buybacks

Bear:
- AI startups (Harvey, Legora) iterate faster on UX and workflow
- Elsevier faces open access pressure (academic publishing disruption)
- Premium valuation (~30x+ earnings) prices in continued execution
- Horizontal AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT) could eventually match domain data through partnerships
- Legal profession is conservative — slower AI adoption than predicted
