## Bikes & micromobility (Lyft Urban Solutions)

### How Lyft got here

Nov 2018: Acquired Motivate for $251M — operator of Citi Bike (NYC), [[Divvy]] (Chicago), Capital Bikeshare (DC), and [[Ford]] GoBike (now Bay Wheels, SF). Became America's largest bikeshare service overnight.

2023: New CEO David Risher explored selling the division. WSJ reported buyer interest. Bikes/scooters = only ~5% of revenue ($48M/quarter). Seen as a distraction from rideshare profitability.

Sep 2024: Reversed course. E-bike rides +65% YoY. Risher: "It would be insane not to take it on ourselves." Killed all dockless scooter/bike operations ($34-46M in disposal charges, ~1% layoffs). Kept only docked programs. Combined Motivate systems + PBSC (bikeshare-as-a-service in 49 global markets) into Lyft Urban Solutions.

### Current operations

| System | City | Type |
|--------|------|------|
| Citi Bike | New York City | Docked + e-bikes |
| [[Divvy]] | Chicago | Docked + e-bikes |
| Capital Bikeshare | Washington DC | Docked |
| Bay Wheels | San Francisco | Docked + e-bikes |
| PBSC clients | 49 markets globally | Bikeshare-as-a-service |

Fleet: 68,000+ bikes. E-bike rides growing fastest.

### Financials (segment)

- Revenue: ~3-5% of Lyft total ($5.8B annual)
- Citi Bike revenue +60% from 2023 to 2024
- NYC contract expires 2029 — city evaluating subsidy structure
- E-bike trips surging: +47% globally (2025), +65% YoY in Lyft systems

### Strategic logic

Docked bikeshare solves the problems that killed shared scooters: fixed stations prevent vandalism/clutter, city contracts provide regulatory stability, and the model is profitable at scale in dense cities. Lyft's bet: own the urban mobility stack (rideshare + bikes + autonomous) so users never leave the app.
