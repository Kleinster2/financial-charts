## Why Cencora matters

**Drug distribution oligopoly.** Cencora, [[McKesson]], and [[Cardinal Health]] together supply >90% of the US pharmaceutical distribution market. Their combined revenues approach $900B annually.

**Specialty pharma focus.** Cencora has invested heavily in specialty drug distribution and manufacturer services, capturing higher-margin revenue as biologics and specialty drugs grow.

## Name change

Rebranded from AmerisourceBergen to Cencora in August 2023. Ticker changed from ABC to COR. The rebrand aimed to create unified global identity and shed legacy names.

## Business model

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross margin | ~3-4% |
| Operating margin | ~2% |

Like [[McKesson]], ultra-thin margins on massive volumes. Growth comes from specialty/higher-margin services, not volume expansion in core distribution.

---

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Oligopoly position provides stability
- Specialty services growing 9%+ annually
- Retina acquisition adds high-margin revenue
- Network automation improving efficiency

**Bear case:**
- Customer concentration (Walgreens is major customer)
- Drug pricing pressure could compress margins
- PBM disintermediation risk
- Limited organic growth in core distribution
