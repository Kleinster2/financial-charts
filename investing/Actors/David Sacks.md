## Davos 2026 panel (Jan 23, 2026)

Panel with [[Michael Kratsios]] (US CTO), moderated by Maria Bartiromo. Sacks's most detailed public articulation of Trump administration AI policy.

### US winning the AI race

- Compares Trump's July 2025 AI speech to Kennedy declaring the space race
- US ahead at every layer of the stack, with advantage growing deeper down:
  - Models: ~6 months ahead of [[China]]
  - Chips: ~2 years ahead
  - Semiconductor manufacturing equipment: ~5 years ahead
- Two areas where [[China]] has advantage: (1) energy production — grid doubled in 10 years vs US 2-3% growth, (2) AI optimism — [[Stanford]] poll shows 83% of Chinese believe AI more beneficial than harmful vs only 39% in US

### Infrastructure buildout is demand-driven

- "No such thing as a dark GPU right now" — every GPU deployed is generating tokens
- Not a dot-com/dark fiber repeat — demand is real (chatbots, coding assistants)
- Infrastructure buildout added ~2% to US GDP growth rate in 2025 (helped reach 4-5%)
- Expects similar contribution in 2026
- [[Oracle]], [[Blackstone]] making huge investments — "very savvy market players" who see ROI

### Data centers and power

- Bernie Sanders sent letter saying stop all data centers — "if we do that we will lose the AI race"
- [[China]] spinning up new nuclear/coal plant every single week for data center power
- Trump clear: consumers should NOT pay higher rates because of data centers
- [[Microsoft]] pledged (week of Jan 20) that its DCs won't cause residential rate increases
- Hyperscalers/AI companies never planned to draw off the grid — all planned own power generation
- Biden administration had made behind-the-meter generation impossible as policy — had to be part of larger grid
- Secretary Wright (DOE) + FERC reformed those regulations
- Trump's vision: "Let AI companies become power companies"
- Sacks argues DCs will actually BRING DOWN rates:
  1. DCs can sell excess power back to the grid
  2. Fixed costs of power generation amortized over greater supply → lower meter rate for everybody
  - "The more scale you get in electricity, the price comes down"

### Regulatory philosophy

- Over 1,200 AI bills going through state legislatures — "knee-jerk reaction"
- Patchwork most detrimental to early-stage companies and entrepreneurs (big guys can navigate 50 different rules)
- Working on lightweight federal standard — needs 60 Senate votes (bipartisan)
- States would keep: child safety, data center permitting
- "Can't replace something with nothing" — pushback requires offering federal standard
- Rescinded 100-page Biden executive order + 200-page Biden diffusion rule in first week
- Silicon Valley's magic = "permissionless innovation" — since HP 85 years ago
- Biden regulations would have changed to "go to Washington to get approval for your idea"

### AI optimism gap

- [[Stanford]] polling: [[China]] 83% AI optimism, US only 39%
- Asian countries high, Western countries low
- Explanations: (1) media focuses on doom/gloom, (2) Hollywood dystopian portrayals (Terminator, 2001), (3) tech leaders talking about eliminating 50% of knowledge workers
- This feeds regulatory frenzy — could "shoot ourselves in the foot" and cost the AI race

### AI applications evolution

- Phase 1: AI chatbots (better web search, research)
- Phase 2: Chain of thought (deeper reasoning)
- Phase 3: Coding assistants — "real breakthrough" in past few months, "mind-blowing" per developers
- Phase 4 (2026): Knowledge worker tools — same assistants outputting Excel models, PowerPoints, websites
- Highlighted [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude]] Code (powered by Opus 4.5) as the product "everyone's going crazy over"
- [[Claude]] Code "co-work" tab: non-coders can point to file drive, emulate user's style/format, analyze email
- "Just need one more layer of abstraction" on top → personal digital assistant
- Could happen in 2026: coding assistants → personal digital assistants
- References movie "Her" — voice interface coming

### Winning = market share

- Simple test: if in 5 years American chips and models are everywhere, we won; if Huawei chips and DeepSeek models, we lost
- Silicon Valley companies become huge by creating ecosystems (most apps in app store, most developers on API)
- "Biggest ecosystem wins" — need partner mindset, create value for partners
- This platform thinking is "pretty alien to Washington's command-and-control mindset"

### [[China]] strategy / Huawei as national champion

- [[China]] not allowing [[NVIDIA]] chips into country (Bloomberg, Reuters reporting)
- [[China]] wants to indigenize chip production, stand up [[Huawei]] as national champion
- Creating market subsidy for Huawei by keeping out competition
- Plan: Huawei dominates [[China]] first → uses scale → tries to take over rest of world
- Chip production is a scale-up business — domestic dominance = powerful platform for global push
- Echoes Huawei telecom playbook from first Trump administration

### DeepSeek impact

- About a year ago (early 2025), [[DeepSeek]] "put Chinese AI on the map"
- Before DeepSeek, complacency in the West about relative position
- Global competition wasn't even discussed 2 years ago
- After DeepSeek: realized we're in a competition, must win, must be careful about overregulation

### AI risks: Orwellian misuse by government

- Concerned about government misuse: surveillance, censorship, brainwashing
- "Woke AI" — political bias built in, can be subtle but huge impact on what people learn/think/know
- Biden EO had 20 pages of DEI language promoting AI models need DEI layer → led to "black George Washington" ([[Gemini]])
- Same "trust and safety apparatus" from social media (censor, deplatform, shadowban) could be built into AI
- Trump rescinded Biden EO + signed order: federal government won't procure politically biased AI
- First Amendment: AI companies can make biased AI, but government won't buy it
- Worries about future regime pressuring AI companies to build in political bias

### [[EU]] criticism

- When [[EU]] talks about AI leadership, they mean regulators showing world "the regulatory model"
- "Bad case of main character syndrome" — regulators think they're the main characters
- "Regulators are supporting players. The main characters always have to be the entrepreneurs"
- [[EU]] AI Act passed before [[ChatGPT]] existed — makes no sense in world of frontier models

### Jobs / Elon Musk view

- Elon is a friend, slight disagreement
- Full Musk view includes abundance: everyone has what they want, no money (people leave out this part)
- Sacks: Elon "directionally correct" — heading toward greater abundance, rising living standards, productivity
- Will lead to rising wages, won't put everyone out of work
- Timelines matter — world with no money not in next 5 years
- Star Trek comparison (no money because abundance)
