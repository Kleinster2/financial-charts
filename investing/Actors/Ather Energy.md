## What makes Ather, Ather

1. **IIT pedigree + first-mover** — First Indian company to build a truly premium EV scooter from scratch (not an ICE conversion). Founded in IIT Madras robotics lab
2. **Hero backing** — Hero MotoCorp (world's largest motorcycle maker, 38% stake) provides distribution reach, manufacturing expertise, and credibility
3. **Ather Grid** — Proprietary fast-charging network across India. Infrastructure play alongside hardware
4. **Software-defined** — OTA updates, connected dashboard, ride analytics. Closest to a "smart" two-wheeler in India
5. **India EV tailwind** — 200M+ ICE two-wheelers in India. EV penetration <5%. Massive conversion opportunity

## Founding story

2013: Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, engineering graduates from IIT Madras, disassembled a commercial electric scooter (YO EXL) in their robotics lab. Found it was terrible. Decided they could build a better one. IIT Madras incubator provided early office space, mentorship, and seed investment (₹25 lakh — now worth ₹50 Cr at IPO, a 200x return).

Forbes 30 Under 30 (2018). Fortune 40 Under 40 (2017, 2019, 2021).

## India EV two-wheeler landscape

| Company | Type | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Ola Electric** | Mass-market | Largest Indian EV 2W; aggressive pricing |
| **TVS Motor** | Legacy OEM | iQube series |
| **Bajaj Auto** | Legacy OEM | Chetak series |
| **Ather Energy** | Premium | Design-led, connected |
| **Hero Electric** | Budget | Volume leader in low-speed segment |

**The opportunity:** India has ~200M two-wheelers (mostly ICE). EV penetration <5%. Government FAME subsidies driving adoption. But [[China battery leverage]] means Chinese components dominate the supply chain.

## Key risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Still loss-making** | ₹-764 Cr loss; path to profitability unclear at current scale |
| **Competition** | Ola Electric aggressive on price; legacy OEMs (TVS, Bajaj, Hero) have distribution |
| **China supply chain** | Battery cells and components largely sourced from China |
| **Subsidy dependency** | FAME incentives drive demand; policy changes could stall adoption |
| **Premium niche** | India is extremely price-sensitive; premium positioning limits TAM |
| **Post-IPO pressure** | Listed at ₹328, closed first day at ₹300; market skeptical on losses |
