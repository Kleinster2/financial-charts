## Significance

Belardi is the operational architect of the PE-insurance model. While [[Marc Rowan]] gets credit for the strategic vision and Apollo integration, Belardi built the actual insurance machine — the underwriting, distribution, risk management, and regulatory relationships that make Athene work. His [[AIG]] background provided the institutional knowledge to build a major insurer from scratch.
