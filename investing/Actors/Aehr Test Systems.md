## What Aehr does

**Wafer-level burn-in (WLB):**
- Tests entire wafer at once (not die-by-die)
- Applies stress (heat, voltage) to find defects
- Critical for reliability-sensitive applications
- SiC, GaN, silicon photonics

---

## SiC opportunity

**Silicon Carbide for EVs:**
- EV inverters use SiC chips
- SiC = higher efficiency vs silicon
- Reliability critical (safety)
- Burn-in testing essential

| SiC player | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Wolfspeed | US SiC leader |
| [[Infineon]] | Major player |
| [[STMicro]] | [[Tesla]] supplier |
| [[onsemi]] | Growing |
