## Why Aehr Test matters

SiC testing specialist benefiting from EV adoption:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | AEHR ([[Nasdaq]]) |
| Market cap | ~$500M |
| Focus | Wafer-level burn-in |
| Revenue | ~$100M |
| HQ | Fremont, California |

## What Aehr does

Wafer-level burn-in (WLB):
- Tests entire wafer at once (not die-by-die)
- Applies stress (heat, voltage) to find defects
- Critical for reliability-sensitive applications
- SiC, GaN, silicon photonics

---

## SiC opportunity

Silicon Carbide for EVs:
- EV inverters use SiC chips
- SiC = higher efficiency vs silicon
- Reliability critical (safety)
- Burn-in testing essential

| SiC player | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Wolfspeed | US SiC leader |
| [[Infineon]] | Major player |
| [[STMicro]] | [[Tesla]] supplier |
| [[onsemi]] | Growing |

## FOX-XP system

Flagship product:
- Full wafer contactors
- High-temp testing capability
- Multiple wafer parallel testing
- Designed for SiC/GaN

---

## Beyond SiC

Other applications:
- GaN (gallium nitride) — power, RF
- Silicon photonics — data center optics
- Memory — specialty testing
- AI chips — reliability screening

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- SiC adoption = Aehr demand
- EV growth secular
- Niche monopoly position
- Expanding beyond SiC
- Small cap, high growth

Bear:
- Small, volatile stock
- Customer concentration
- SiC adoption pace uncertain
- Competition from larger players

## Hyperscaler AI ASIC burn-in win (Feb 11, 2026)

Secured initial production order from a "premier large-scale data center provider" for package-level burn-in of next-generation AI ASIC processors:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Systems | Multiple Sonoma ultra-high-power burn-in systems |
| Includes | Turnkey burn-in modules (BIMs) + device-specific sockets |
| Delivery | Summer 2026 |
| Customer | Unnamed hyperscaler designing proprietary AI accelerator ASICs |
| Outlook | "Very large expansion" of Sonoma purchases expected H2 2026 into 2027 |

The customer's current-gen AI processor is already ramping in volume production. This order is for the next-gen, significantly higher-power device used in training and inference.

CEO Gayn Erickson: "We believe this initial production order positions Aehr very well for high-volume system and consumable shipments later this year and into 2027."

Stock surged ~40% on the news. This is the long-awaited validation of Aehr's AI burn-in opportunity beyond SiC — every custom AI ASIC needs production burn-in testing, and Sonoma is the only proven solution for ultra-high-power packages.

Reinstated H2 FY2026 guidance: revenue $25-30M, non-GAAP net loss/share $(0.09) to $(0.05).
