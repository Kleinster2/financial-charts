## Q4 2025 / Rate cap risk

**Credit card rate cap warning:**

CFO Mark Mason delivered starkest warning among big banks:
> "An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly."

Said 10% cap would likely result "in a significant slowdown in the economy."

**BlackRock outsourcing:** Handed ~$80B in wealthy client assets to [[BlackRock]] — one of industry's biggest outsourcing deals.

**Expense guidance:** Declined to provide concrete 2026 expense estimate despite investor questions.
