## Why [[Siemens]] EDA matters

Third player in EDA, different angle:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Siemens]] AG (SIEGY) |
| Acquired | 2017 for $4.5B |
| Focus | PCB, automotive, industrial |
| Position | \#3 EDA |

## History

**Mentor Graphics → [[Siemens]]:**
- Founded 1981
- Long EDA history
- [[Siemens]] acquired 2017
- Rebranded [[Siemens]] EDA 2021

---

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| PCB | PADS, Xpedition |
| IC design | Calibre (DRC/LVS) |
| [[Automotive]] | Capital, Tessent |
| Simulation | ModelSim, Questa |

---

## Calibre leadership

**Manufacturing verification:**
- Calibre = industry standard
- Design rule checking (DRC)
- Layout vs schematic (LVS)
- Used by all foundries

Calibre is the one area where [[Siemens]] leads.

---

## [[Automotive]] focus

**[[Siemens]] synergy:**
- Electrical systems design
- Wire harness
- ADAS verification
- Industrial automation

Different market than Synopsys/Cadence.

---

## Investment implication

**Not directly investable:**
- Part of [[Siemens]] conglomerate
- Industrial + EDA exposure
- [[Automotive]] semiconductor angle
- Less pure-play than SNPS/CDNS

---

## Competitive position

| vs Synopsys/Cadence | [[Siemens]] |
|---------------------|---------|
| Advanced node IC | Weaker |
| PCB design | Competitive |
| [[Automotive]] | Stronger |
| Calibre | Industry standard |

Niche player with specific strengths.
