## The 2021 Independence Law

**Complementary Law 179 (Feb 2021)** — enacted under Bolsonaro, exists because of Dilma.

| Element | Pre-2021 | Post-2021 |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| President term | At president's pleasure | Fixed 4 years (not aligned with presidential term) |
| Removal | Any time | Only "for cause" |
| Mandate | Implicit | Explicit price stability mandate |
| Board | Changed with government | Staggered terms |

**Why it passed:** Dilma's "New Economic [[Matrix]]" (2011-16) destroyed credibility, caused 10.7% inflation, contributed to impeachment. Cross-party consensus that CB needed protection from political pressure.

**K-P mechanism:** Fixed terms = commitment device. President can't fire hawkish governor → markets believe inflation target → expectations anchor → lower actual inflation.

## Time consistency case study

Brazil demonstrates both K-P violation and vindication:

### Violation: Dilma era (2011-2016)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Action | Replaced entire board, cut rates despite above-target expectations |
| Selic | 12.25% → 7.25% (2011-12) |
| Result | [[Inflation]] doubled (5.9% → 10.7%), credibility destroyed |
| Fix | Rates to 14.25%, Dilma impeached, Temer reforms |

See [[Time consistency#Brazil 2011-2016 — Dilma Rousseff]]

### Vindication: Galípolo era (2025-present)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Setup | Lula attacked CB independence, called it "nonsense" |
| Expectation | Lula's appointee would be dovish |
| Reality | Galípolo hiked 450bp, held at 15%, vowed "extended period" |
| Result | Institutional design worked — even partisan appointee prioritized credibility |

**The punchline:** The 2021 law changed incentives. Galípolo knows his reputation depends on inflation outcomes, not pleasing Lula. K-P vindicated.

## Current challenges (Jan 2026)

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| [[Inflation]] above target | 5.53% vs 3.0% target |
| Expectations unanchored | 4.4% for 2025, 4.2% for 2026 (above target) |
| Real weakness | Down 27% in 2024 |
| Fiscal concerns | Lula spending pressures |
| Growth drag | 15% rates slowing economy (2.0% GDP projected) |

**Galípolo's stance:** "Structure of Brazilian economy requires more rigid calibration... transmission channels slower than other economies."
