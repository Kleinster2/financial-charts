**Hill and Valley Forum** — The most powerful tech-government nexus in America. A private bipartisan consortium of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, tech CEOs, and US lawmakers, convened to combat China's influence on the US technology industry and advance American reindustrialization. Founded in March 2023 by [[Jacob Helberg]], [[Christian Garrett]] ([[137 Ventures]]), and [[Delian Asparouhov]] ([[Founders Fund]]/[[Varda Space]]). Core members include [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Vinod Khosla]].

Secretary of the Interior [[Doug Burgum]] called it the *"conclave of Silicon Valley."* Helberg: *"We've made the 2021 counterculture the 2025 mainstream culture."*

## What it represents

Hill & Valley is the operational engine of [[US-China decoupling]] — the institutional expression of Silicon Valley's national security wing merging with Washington's China hawks. Every major US tech-decoupling policy of 2023-2025 was either incubated here or championed by its members: The network runs through the [[Peter Thiel]]/[[Palantir]] orbit:

```
Peter Thiel (Palantir co-founder, Founders Fund)
    ├── Alex Karp (Palantir CEO) → Hill & Valley speaker
    ├── Keith Rabois (Khosla Ventures) → married to Jacob Helberg
    ├── Delian Asparouhov (Founders Fund) → Hill & Valley co-founder
    ├── Palmer Luckey (Anduril founder) → defense tech
    └── Jacob Helberg (Under Secretary of State) → Hill & Valley founder
            └── Pax Silica (State Dept flagship)
```

The forum's policy wins — each a concrete step in [[US-China decoupling]]:
- TikTok forced-sale bill (2024) — directly lobbied for by Helberg and Khosla. The inaugural 2023 dinner was timed to TikTok CEO's congressional testimony.
- [[Pax Silica]] (2025) — Helberg created it after becoming Under Secretary. A 10-nation semiconductor alliance designed to friend-shore the chip supply chain away from China.
- CHIPS Act implementation — [[Todd Young]] (co-author) is a forum speaker. $52B+ reshoring US semiconductor manufacturing.
- Defense tech mainstreaming — [[Anduril]], [[Palantir]], Shield AI went from fringe to default Pentagon partners, partly through relationships built here.
- AI export controls — forum attendees ([[Jensen Huang]], [[Lisa Su]]) are both subject to and consulted on chip export restrictions to China.

## Significance for investors

Hill & Valley is where tech policy gets made before it reaches Congress. If you want to know which companies will get defense contracts, which technologies will get export-controlled, and which supply chain policies are coming — this is the room where it happens.

The forum's attendee list is essentially a portfolio: [[Nvidia]], [[Palantir]], [[Anduril]], [[Oracle]], [[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]], [[Google]] — these are the companies whose executives are writing the rules alongside the lawmakers who will implement them.

Washington Post: *"The tech billionaires who helped ban TikTok want to write AI rules for Trump."*
