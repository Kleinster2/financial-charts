## Strategic context

Positioned as the key beneficiary of [[Brazil]]'s natural gas market liberalization and the shift away from [[Petrobras]] monopoly pricing. Pre-salt gas supply and LNG imports via the Santos terminal provide pricing advantage. ~R$150B addressable investment opportunity in Brazilian gas infrastructure over the next decade.

Dec 2025: [[Cosan]] restructured the Compass holding vehicle (Cosan Dez) — [[Bradesco]] BBI and [[BTG Pactual]] acquired ~23% for R$4B, a partial monetization instead of a full IPO.
