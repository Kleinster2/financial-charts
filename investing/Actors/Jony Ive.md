## Why Ive matters

The designer of the iPhone is now designing AI's hardware future:

| Era | Role | Product |
|-----|------|---------|
| Apple (1992-2019) | Chief Design Officer | iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch |
| LoveFrom (2019-2025) | Founder | Design consultancy |
| OpenAI (2025-) | Hardware lead (via io) | [[Screenless AI]] device |

## io acquisition (May 2025)

**OpenAI acquired Ive's startup for $6.4B:**
- Started as Ive + Altman collaboration (2023)
- LoveFrom team joined
- Building dedicated AI hardware device
- Ive now leading OpenAI hardware efforts

## The AI device

**What we know:**
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Form factor | Screenless, pocket-sized |
| Positioning | "Third core device" (not phone, not laptop) |
| Timeline | Prototypes done, launch <2 years |
| Design philosophy | "Calm" — opposite of notification-heavy smartphones |

**Altman's vision:**
> "Not like walking through Times Square... like sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake."

**Ive's approach:**
> "I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity."

## Apple legacy

**Ive-designed products:**
- iPhone (2007) — defined smartphone era
- iPad (2010)
- MacBook Air, MacBook Pro
- Apple Watch
- AirPods
- iMac G3 (1998) — saved Apple

**Design philosophy:**
- Radical simplicity
- Hardware-software integration
- Premium materials
- Iconic, recognizable forms

---

## Chip implications

**If OpenAI device succeeds:**
- Custom silicon likely (Apple model)
- Edge AI inference chips
- Low-power design critical (screenless = battery life)
- Potential [[TSMC]] customer for custom SoC

**Parallel to Apple:**
- Apple designed custom chips → massive TSMC volume
- OpenAI could follow same path
- Ive understands hardware-chip co-design from Apple

---

## Sam Altman partnership

**Connection:**
- Collaboration started 2023
- Built on "friendship, curiosity, shared values"
- Ive designing, Altman providing AI/business
- Combined: hardware vision + AI capability

**Altman's hardware bets:**
| Venture | Focus | Ive role |
|---------|-------|----------|
| OpenAI device | [[Consumer AI]] | Lead designer |
| [[Oklo]] | Nuclear (fission) | None |
| [[Helion Energy]] | Nuclear (fusion) | None |
| Worldcoin | Biometric orbs | None |

---

## Risks / Considerations

- AI hardware category unproven ([[Humane]], Rabbit failed)
- Screenless paradigm may not resonate
- Apple could compete (Siri device?)
- $6.4B is expensive for pre-product startup
- Ive's best work was with Steve Jobs — can he replicate magic?
