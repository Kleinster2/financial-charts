## Why Hangzhou matters

No longer just "West Lake city" — now [[China]]'s most aggressive AI launchpad:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key platform | [[Alibaba]] (e-commerce, cloud) |
| AI labs | [[DeepSeek]], [[MiniMax]], others |
| [[Robotics]] | [[Unitree]] (quadruped robots) |
| University | Zhejiang University (ZJU) |
| Focus | Software, AI, algorithms |

## Hangzhou vs Shenzhen

| Factor | Hangzhou | Shenzhen |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Focus** | Software, AI, platforms | Hardware, manufacturing |
| **Champions** | Alibaba, DeepSeek, Unitree | [[BYD]], [[DJI]], ZTE, [[Huawei]] |
| **Talent source** | ZJU, Alibaba alumni | Foxconn, supply chain |
| **Investor profile** | VC, growth equity | Industrial, strategic |
| **Advantage** | Data, algorithms, platform effects | Supply chain, scale manufacturing |

**Complementary, not competing** — founders choose based on whether company is software-heavy or hardware-heavy.

## Liangzhu: The indie AI scene

Beyond frontier labs, Hangzhou has an indie AI hub in [[Liangzhu]] suburb:

| Aspect | Frontier (DeepSeek) | Indie (Liangzhu) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Focus | Foundation models | [[Consumer]] apps |
| Products | R1, V3 | ADHD tools, fitness gamification |
| Vibe | Technical, VC-backed | Hipster, bootstrapped |
| [[Target]] | Enterprise, API | Global consumers |

**Liangzhu "villagers":** Silicon Valley alumni + big tech refugees building quirky lifestyle AI.

**Business model:** Chinese dev costs + hardware supply chain → global consumer prices.

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** as a geography, but:
- [[Alibaba]] — public, Hangzhou HQ
- [[DeepSeek]] — private, watch for funding rounds
- [[Unitree]] — private, robotics exposure

**Thesis:** Hangzhou = [[China]]'s AI software stack. If you're bullish on [[China]] AI capability development, Hangzhou companies are the lab.
