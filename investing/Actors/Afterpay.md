# Afterpay

**Afterpay** — Australian buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company acquired by [[Block]] in January 2022 for ~$13.9B in stock (announced at $29B in Aug 2021 — value halved as Block shares fell). Founded in 2014 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen. Operates as Clearpay in UK/Europe.

Block's largest acquisition and its most controversial — the deal closed near the peak of the BNPL bubble. Now integrated into both [[Square]] seller and [[Cash App]] consumer ecosystems.
