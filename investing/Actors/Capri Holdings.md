| Buyer | [[Prada]] S.p.A. |
| Price | $1.375B |

## Failed Tapestry merger

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | Aug 2023 |
| Price | $8.5B |
| Blocked by | FTC (federal court, Oct 2024) |
| Rationale | Would eliminate handbag competition (Coach vs Michael Kors) |
| Terminated | Nov 2024 |

The FTC argued the merger would harm consumers in the "accessible luxury" handbag market. After the block, Capri's stock collapsed as it lost its best exit option.

## Michael Kors — the core problem

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Brand dilution** | Over-distributed, too many outlets |
| **Pricing confusion** | Full-price vs. outlet cannibalization |
| **Competition** | Coach resurgent, Tory Burch growing |
| **Customer loss** | Neither luxury enough nor cheap enough |
| **Target** | $4B revenue, double-digit margins "over time" |

CEO Idol's admitted "self-inflicted missteps" include:
- Repositioning attempts that confused customers
- Too many SKUs, not enough hero products
- Outlet overexposure damaging brand perception

## FY26 outlook

| Metric | FY26 guidance |
|--------|--------------|
| Revenue | $3.375-3.45B |
| Operating income | ~$100M |
| Michael Kors target | $4B (long-term) |
| Jimmy Choo target | $800M (long-term) |

Q2 FY26 showed improvement: revenue -2.5% (vs -6% in Q1). Still declining but decelerating.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stock priced for failure (~$2.5B market cap for $3.4B revenue)
- Versace sale proceeds reduce debt
- Michael Kors brand still has awareness/scale
- Jimmy Choo is niche luxury with growth potential
- New management focus post-merger distraction

**Bear:**
- Michael Kors brand may be permanently impaired
- Accessible luxury = worst segment (barbell problem)
- Still losing money, burning credibility
- No clear creative vision
- Idol's track record of failed repositioning
