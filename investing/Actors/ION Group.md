## AI disintermediation risk (Feb 2026)

ION Group's bonds sold off in February 2026 as the [[AI disintermediation]] thesis spread to financial data providers. [[Dealogic]] and [[Mergermarket]] are classic information intermediaries — deal league tables, M&A intelligence — exactly the business model AI threatens. The leveraged debt structure amplifies revenue risk. ION was already restructuring to refinance expensive private debt; the AI narrative complicates that refinancing.
