# Iron Mountain

Legacy records management company turned **AI-era data center REIT**. One of the more unlikely transformation stories in the market — went from storing boxes of paper in underground vaults to operating 424+ MW of data center capacity with 1.2 GW in the development pipeline. NYSE: IRM.

## The transformation story

Iron Mountain was founded in 1951 literally storing records in an underground vault in a depleted iron mine in upstate New York. For decades it was the boring-but-reliable leader in physical records storage — boxes of paper, tape backups, legal/medical archives. The kind of company nobody thinks about.

Then it pivoted into data centers, leveraging:
1. **Customer relationships** — 95% of the Fortune 1000 already trusted IRM with their physical records
2. **Real estate expertise** — decades of experience acquiring and managing storage facilities globally
3. **REIT structure** — converted to REIT in 2014, giving it tax-advantaged access to capital for data center buildout
4. **Legacy cash flows** — physical records storage is declining but still throws off stable cash (~$4B+ annually) that funds data center expansion

The data center segment is now growing 30%+ YoY while the legacy business provides steady (if slowly declining) revenue. The AI demand surge accelerated this — enterprises need colocation capacity for AI workloads, and IRM's existing relationships give it a privileged position to upsell.

## Segments

| Segment | Role | Trend |
|---------|------|-------|
| Records & Information Management | Legacy paper/tape storage | Stable, slowly declining |
| Data Center | Colocation, powered shell | +33% growth, 52.6% EBITDA margins |
| Asset Lifecycle Management | IT asset disposition, secure destruction | Growing |
| Digital Transformation | Scanning, digitization, cloud services | Growing |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Data center revenue growing 30%+ with 52.6% EBITDA margins — guided 25%+ for 2026
- 1.2 GW pipeline at a time when data center capacity is scarce globally
- Legacy business is a cash cow funding the transition — not dying fast enough to matter
- 95% Fortune 1000 penetration = built-in upsell channel
- REIT structure = growing dividend, tax-advantaged
- AI demand is structural — every enterprise needs more compute

**Bear:**
- Net income only $145M on $6.9B revenue — profitability is thin
- Heavy capex required to build out data center pipeline
- Competing against pure-play data center REITs ([[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]]) with deeper expertise
- Legacy records business is a melting ice cube
- Valuation premium pricing in years of data center growth — execution risk is high
- $16.7M PP&E write-down in 2025 suggests some assets aren't performing
