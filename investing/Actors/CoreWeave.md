**CoreWeave** — GPU cloud provider. NVIDIA-backed. Poster child for AI infrastructure financing risk.

---

## Why CoreWeave matters

CoreWeave is the largest "neocloud" — GPU-focused cloud competing with hyperscalers:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Focus | GPU cloud for AI workloads |
| Revenue concentration | 65% from [[Microsoft]] |
| CDS spread | 773 bps (42% implied default probability) |
| Key backer | [[NVIDIA]] |
| IPO | March 2025 |

---

## Business model

**What they do:**
- Rent NVIDIA GPUs to AI companies
- Compete with AWS/Azure/GCP on GPU availability
- Faster deployment than hyperscalers
- Focus on AI training/inference workloads

**Customers:**
- Microsoft (65% of revenue)
- AI startups
- Enterprise AI teams
- Inference providers

---

## NVIDIA relationship

**NVIDIA is investor and supplier:**
- Strategic investment in CoreWeave
- Priority GPU allocation
- CoreWeave helps absorb GPU production
- Symbiotic: NVIDIA needs buyers, CoreWeave needs GPUs

**The question:** Is CoreWeave a real business or NVIDIA channel stuffing?

---

## Financing

**Debt load:**
- $7.5B+ debt financing (Blackstone, others)
- High leverage for growth-stage company
- GPUs as collateral

**IPO (March 2025):**
- Raised capital to fund GPU purchases
- Stock volatile post-IPO
- Market skeptical of unit economics

## The risk case

CoreWeave is cited in [[AI infrastructure financing risk]] as key vulnerability:

| Metric | Value | Concern |
|--------|-------|---------|
| CDS spread | 773 bps | 42% implied default probability |
| Revenue concentration | 65% Microsoft | Single customer dependency |
| Debt | $7.5B+ | High leverage |
| GPU depreciation | Faster than assumed | Asset value risk |

**If Microsoft pulls back:** CoreWeave faces existential risk.

---

## Bull case

- GPU shortage = pricing power
- Microsoft contract provides visibility
- NVIDIA backing = GPU access advantage
- AI demand is real and growing
- Hyperscalers can't meet all demand

---

## Bear case

- 65% Microsoft concentration is dangerous
- CDS spread implies near-junk credit
- GPU depreciation accelerating (Blackwell → Rubin)
- Competing with hyperscalers long-term is hard
- Could be NVIDIA inventory management vehicle

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Advantage |
|------------|-----------|
| AWS/Azure/GCP | Scale, balance sheet, ecosystem |
| Lambda Labs | Developer-friendly, simpler |
| Crusoe | Cheap power (stranded gas) |
| **CoreWeave** | GPU availability, speed |

CoreWeave wins on availability but loses on cost and scale long-term.

## For theses

**[[AI infrastructure financing risk]]:** CoreWeave is the canary in the coal mine
**[[AI hyperscalers]]:** Neoclouds compete for same GPU demand
