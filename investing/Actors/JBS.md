**Settlements:**

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Global protein demand growing (population, emerging market middle class)
- Diversified across proteins (beef, chicken, pork) and geographies
- NYSE listing improves liquidity, governance perception
- Scale advantages in processing

**Bear:**
- Beef cattle cycle turning (US herd rebuilding = margin pressure)
- Governance concerns despite reforms (Batista family control)
- Climate/[[ESG]] scrutiny on beef production
- Brazil currency exposure
