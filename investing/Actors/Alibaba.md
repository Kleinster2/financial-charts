## Why Alibaba matters

Alibaba Cloud is China's AWS — and a major AI infrastructure spender:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cloud position | #1 in China (~35% share) |
| AI model | Qwen (通义千问) |
| GPU constraints | Export controls limit access |
| Valuation | Depressed vs US peers |

## Alibaba Cloud

**China's largest cloud:**
- ~35% China cloud market share
- Competitor to Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud
- Enterprise + government customers
- International expansion (limited)

**AI infrastructure:**
- Building GPU clusters
- Limited to H200/older chips (export controls)
- Can't access Blackwell
- Investing in custom silicon

---

## Qwen AI model

**Alibaba's LLM:**
- Qwen series (通义千问)
- Open-sourced versions
- Competitive with Chinese peers
- Powers Alibaba's AI products

**Vs competitors:**
| Company | Model |
|---------|-------|
| [[ByteDance]] | Doubao |
| Baidu | Ernie |
| **Alibaba** | Qwen |
| Tencent | Hunyuan |

---

## Export control impact

**What Alibaba can access:**
- H200 (approved Dec 2025)
- Older NVIDIA GPUs
- AMD alternatives

**What Alibaba can't access:**
- Blackwell (B200)
- Future cutting-edge
- EUV-manufactured chips

**Gap widening:** US competitors train on Blackwell while Alibaba stuck on H200.

---

## Custom silicon efforts

**Responding to export controls:**
- T-Head (平头哥) semiconductor subsidiary
- Custom AI accelerators
- Yitian (倚天) ARM-based server CPU
- Hanguang (含光) AI chip

**Reality:** Still behind NVIDIA, but reducing dependency.

## Competitive position in China

| Competitor | Strength | Alibaba vs |
|------------|----------|------------|
| [[ByteDance]] | Consumer AI, TikTok data | More cloud revenue |
| Baidu | Search, autonomous driving | Larger cloud |
| Tencent | Gaming, WeChat | Larger cloud |
| Huawei | Government, telecom | Private enterprise |

Alibaba leads in cloud but trails ByteDance in AI buzz.

---

## Valuation disconnect

**Alibaba trades at steep discount to US peers:**
- China regulatory risk
- Export control impact
- Geopolitical concerns
- Growth slowdown

**Counter:** Cloud + AI growing, core commerce stable.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- China cloud leader
- AI investment ongoing
- Valuation depressed
- Custom silicon reducing dependency
- Qwen model competitive

**Bear:**
- Export controls cap AI capability
- China regulatory risk
- Geopolitics (delisting risk?)
- Competition from ByteDance, Huawei
- Growth deceleration
