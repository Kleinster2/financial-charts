## Why Cardinal Health matters

**OptumRx loss and recovery.** Cardinal lost its major distribution contract with OptumRx ([[UnitedHealth]]) to [[McKesson]], causing FY25 revenue to decline. The FY26 rebound (+12% expected) demonstrates resilience and ability to backfill lost volume.

**Specialty growth pivot.** Cardinal is investing heavily in specialty pharmaceuticals and biopharma solutions to improve margins beyond commodity distribution.
