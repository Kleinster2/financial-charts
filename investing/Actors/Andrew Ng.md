**Andrew Ng** — Stanford professor, Coursera co-founder, former Baidu Chief Scientist. Bridge figure between US and China AI. Not a returnee but influential in both ecosystems.

---

## Why Andrew Ng matters

Uniquely positioned across US-China AI divide:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current | Stanford professor, AI Fund |
| Previous | Baidu Chief Scientist (2014-2017) |
| Founded | Coursera, DeepLearning.AI, Landing AI |
| Education | MIT, Berkeley PhD |
| Influence | Millions of students via Coursera |

---

## Career path

| Period | Role | Significance |
|--------|------|--------------|
| 2002 | Stanford professor | Founded Stanford AI Lab |
| 2011 | Google Brain | Co-founded, deep learning at scale |
| 2012 | Coursera | Co-founded, democratized AI education |
| 2014-2017 | Baidu Chief Scientist | Built Baidu AI, recruited talent |
| 2017- | AI Fund, Landing AI | VC + enterprise AI |

---

## The Baidu years

Ng led Baidu's AI transformation:

| Achievement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Baidu Research | Built Silicon Valley + Beijing labs |
| Recruiting | Brought top talent to Baidu |
| Deep Speech | Speech recognition breakthrough |
| Autonomous driving | Early Apollo foundation |
| Scale | 1,300+ AI researchers by 2017 |

**Why he joined:** China offered scale (data, users, speed) that US couldn't match at the time.

**Why he left:** "Mission accomplished" — Baidu AI established. Returned to entrepreneurship.

## Bridge figure role

Unlike returnees (海归), Ng maintained both positions:

| US presence | China presence |
|-------------|----------------|
| Stanford professor | Baidu Chief Scientist |
| Google Brain founder | Trained China AI teams |
| Coursera (global) | Chinese language courses |
| AI Fund (US VC) | China investments |

**Not politically aligned:** Focused on technical progress, avoided geopolitical positioning.

---

## Educational impact

| Platform | Reach |
|----------|-------|
| Coursera ML course | 5M+ enrolled |
| DeepLearning.AI | Millions of certificates |
| Stanford CS229 | Foundational course |

**Effect:** Trained generation of AI practitioners globally, including many in China.

---

## Current ventures

| Venture | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| AI Fund | VC investing in AI startups |
| Landing AI | Enterprise AI deployment |
| DeepLearning.AI | Education platform |

**Thesis:** AI deployment (not just research) is the bottleneck. Focus on practical implementation.

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (academic, private companies).

**Indirect relevance:**
- AI Fund portfolio companies
- Landing AI customers
- His views influence AI sentiment

**Thesis implications:**
- US-China AI talent flows were bidirectional
- Education democratizes AI capability
- "Applied AI" may be bigger market than frontier research

---

## Views on AI

| Topic | Position |
|-------|----------|
| AI safety | Moderate, not doomer |
| Regulation | Cautious about overreach |
| Open source | Supportive |
| China AI | Respects capability, less political |

**Notable:** Has pushed back on AI extinction concerns as overblown.
