# FTAI Aviation

Jet engine leasing and repair company converting retired [[Boeing]] 737 CFM56 engines into land-based natural gas turbines for [[Data Centers|data center]] power generation.

## Quick stats

| Field | Value |

| **Business** | Jet engine leasing, repair, and power conversion |
| **Key asset** | CFM56 — bestselling commercial aviation engine ever |
| **President** | David Moreno |

## Power business

FTAI is one of the largest owners of the CFM56 engine. In 2025-26, the company began converting these engines into [[Aeroderivative turbines for data centers|aeroderivative gas turbines]] to serve surging data center power demand.

- **Conversion time:** 30-45 days per engine (after 18-month initial design process)
- **Target capacity:** ~100 turbines/year = 2.5 GW
- **Stock impact:** +42% since announcing power business
- **Jefferies estimate:** could add $750M EBITDA/year — ~52% of pre-announcement expected EBITDA
- **Parts advantage:** can remanufacture components with only a few years of flight life remaining — power turbines accumulate less wear than aviation (whether used as peakers or baseload)

The opportunity exists because incumbent heavy-duty turbine makers ([[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]], [[Mitsubishi]]) have years-long wait lists and are deliberately constraining capacity to avoid repeating past oversupply cycles.
