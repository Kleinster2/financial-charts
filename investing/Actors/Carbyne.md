## Controversy

**Epstein connection:** Jeffrey Epstein invested alongside Ehud Barak in 2015 through a limited partnership called Sum (E.B.) 2015. The investment predated Carbyne's institutional rounds and was a relatively small stake. Barak later distanced himself from Epstein.

**Intelligence concerns:** The company's deep ties to Israeli military intelligence (Unit 8200, Mossad-adjacent figures) and access to US 911 infrastructure raised questions from privacy advocates. No evidence of misuse, but the optics complicated US government adoption.

**Intrater/Russia:** Andrew Intrater, a major investor, was questioned in the Mueller investigation regarding Russian election interference. Intrater is cousin to Viktor Vekselberg, a sanctioned Russian oligarch.

## Axon acquisition

[[Axon]] (TASER, body cameras, evidence management) acquired Carbyne in Nov 2025:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deal value | $625M |
| Announced | Nov 4, 2025 |
| Expected close | Q1 2026 |
| Prior valuation | $400M (Sep 2022) |

**Strategic rationale:** Axon already dominates law enforcement hardware (TASERs, body cams) and software (evidence.com). Carbyne adds the 911 dispatch layer — completing the public safety stack from emergency call to arrest to prosecution.
