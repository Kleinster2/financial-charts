## Why Fujimi matters

Dominant in silicon wafer CMP slurries — the polishing step that prepares wafers:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 5384.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~¥150B (~$1B) |
| Silicon wafer CMP share | ~70% (with Entegris, DuPont = 80%+) |
| Founded | 1953 |
| HQ | Nagoya, Japan |

## CMP slurry market position

### Overall CMP slurry market

| Company | Share | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~31% | #1 overall, Cu slurry leader |
| [[Entegris]] | ~25% | #2, CMC acquisition |
| **Fujimi** | ~15% | Japan, silicon wafer focus |
| Others | ~29% | Fragmented |

### Silicon wafer CMP slurry (specialty)

| Company | Share |
|---------|-------|
| **Fujimi** | Dominant |
| Entegris | #2 |
| DuPont/Qnity | #3 |

**Japan = 70% of silicon wafer CMP slurry production.**

## Product focus

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Silicon wafer polishing slurry** | Wafer surface preparation |
| **Oxide CMP slurry** | Dielectric planarization |
| **Metal CMP slurry** | Copper, tungsten |
| **Precision polishing** | Optics, hard disks |

## Why silicon wafer CMP matters

Before any chip is made, the raw silicon wafer must be polished to atomic-level flatness:
- Sub-nanometer surface roughness required
- Defects = yield loss
- Every wafer passes through CMP

Fujimi supplies [[Shin-Etsu]] and [[Sumco]] — the wafer duopoly.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Niche dominance (silicon wafer CMP)
- Japan supply chain position
- Wafer demand = Fujimi demand
- Consumables model
- Small cap, less covered

**Bear:**
- Small market cap, less liquid
- Concentrated in one segment
- Competition from Entegris
- Yen exposure
- Limited growth outside niche
