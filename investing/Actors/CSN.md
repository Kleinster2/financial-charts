## Divestment plan (Jan 15, 2026)

Target: R$16-18B in deleveraging, net debt/EBITDA from 3.14x → 1.83x (then 1.0x long-term), annual interest savings of R$1.5-1.8B.

| Asset | Action | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CSN Cimentos | Sell control | 2nd largest in [[Brazil]] (17Mta); prev. IPO valued at ~US$4B; target signing Q3/Q4 2026 |
| CSN Infra Newco | Sell significant stake | Consolidates ports (Sepetiba, Ceara), Transnordestina rail, MRS stake |
| Steel | Strategic review | Partnerships for cash generation; possible partial/full divestment |
| MRS stake (11%) | Sold to [[CSN Mineracao]] | R$3.35B (completed 2025) |

[[CSN Mineracao]] (CMIN3) is NOT for sale — the crown jewel. CSN holds ~69% after selling 10.74% to [[Itochu]] for R$4.42B (late 2024). P15 expansion targeting 60-65Mt by 2030 (~R$4B/yr EBITDA).

Steinbruch: "It's not because they're bad businesses or unprofitable. On the contrary. But waiting longer doesn't make sense."
