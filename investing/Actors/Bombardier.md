## Business transformation

Bombardier shed its rail division (now [[Alstom]]) and commercial aviation (CRJ → [[Mitsubishi]], CSeries → [[Airbus]] A220) to become a pure-play business jet company. Now competes head-to-head with Gulfstream in the large-cabin segment.

## Gulfstream certification dispute (Feb 2026)

[[Donald Trump]] threatened to decertify all Bombardier jets in the US unless [[Canada]] approved Gulfstream G500/G600/G700/G800. Stock dropped ~6% on the threat. Transport Canada subsequently certified G500 and G600 (Feb 15, 2026); G700/G800 remain pending due to fuel-system icing concerns.

The dispute highlights the competitive tension: Bombardier's Global Express competes directly with Gulfstream G700/G800 in the ultra-long-range segment.

See [[Canada Gulfstream certification]] for full timeline.
