## [[Baidu]] breakthrough

**Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL):**
- Founding engineer under [[Andrew Ng]]
- Co-invented Deep Speech (end-to-end speech recognition)
- Developed Deep Voice (real-time neural TTS)
- Deployed to billions of users in production

**The scaling discovery:**
> "It happened in a very clear relationship you could fit with a physics equation, E equals MC squared kind of equation, a one-parameter equation."

Discovered deep learning systems scale predictably — foundational insight for modern AI scaling laws.
