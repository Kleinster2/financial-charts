# Mayhoola

**Qatari royal family investment vehicle** — owns 70% of [[Valentino]], 100% of [[Balmain]], plus Turkish retailer Beymen. Controlled by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani and associates. Focus on European luxury brands. The Valentino put options (2028-29) could force a sale to [[Kering]] at depressed EBITDA-based valuations.

## Valentino investment

| Date | Event | Amount |
|------|-------|--------|
| Jul 2012 | Acquired from [[Permira]] | **€700M** |
| Jul 2023 | Sold 30% to [[Kering]] | Received **€1.7B** |
| Nov 2024 | Capital injection (pro-rata) | ~€70M (70% of €100M) |

**Returns math:**
- Invested €700M in 2012
- Received €1.7B for 30% in 2023 — already 2.4x return on partial exit
- Remaining 70% valued at ~€4B at 2023 implied EV
- But put option pricing is EBITDA-based, now pointing much lower

**The bind:** Put options exercisable 2028-29 at EBITDA-based pricing. With EBITDA collapsed from €337M (2022) to €246M (2024), the implied price is "substantially below" €4B per Kering. Exercising now would crystallize a poor outcome vs. 2023 peak valuations.

Smaller brand, primarily Paris Fashion Week presence. Less material than Valentino.

## Strategic position

**Strengths:**
- Already cashed out 2.4x on 30% Valentino sale
- Put options give exit path if Valentino recovers
- Long-term holder — no fundraising pressure

**Challenges:**
- Valentino declining double-digits
- Put option pricing tied to depressed EBITDA
- Kering has leverage (can wait out the puts)
- No obvious alternative buyers at €5B+ valuations
