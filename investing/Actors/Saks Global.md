## What happened

**Timeline:**
- Late 2024: Acquired Neiman Marcus for **$2.7B**
- Raised **$2.2B** in bonds to fund deal
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly
- Liquidity crunch → delayed vendor payments
- Vendors pulled back shipments → inventory gaps
- Holiday 2025 season poor → shoppers went to competitors
- Jan 13, 2026: **Chapter 11 filed**

**Vicious cycle:** Couldn't pay vendors → vendors stopped shipping → no inventory → no sales → couldn't pay vendors.

## Creditors

| Creditor | Amount owed |
|----------|-------------|
| Chanel | $100M+ |
| Various fashion brands (via Hilldun) | $66M |
| Gift card holders | $320M |
| Bondholders | $2.2B+ |

**Gary Wassner (Hilldun Corp CEO):** Represents several dozen fashion brands owed ~$66M. Recovery depends on profitability post-emergence.

## Restructuring

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CEO through Ch 11 | Geoffroy van Raemdonck (ex-Neiman) |
| DIP financing | $1.75B |
| Exit financing | $500M committed |
| Expected exit | Later 2026 |

**Potential outcomes:**
- Creditors swap debt for equity
- Asset sales (Bergdorf likely to attract buyers)
- Store closures in mid-size cities

**Mary Ross Gilbert (Bloomberg Intelligence):** "Bergdorf is going to have a number of interested parties. It's really the luxe of luxe."
