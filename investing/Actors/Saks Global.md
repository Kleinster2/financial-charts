## What happened

**Timeline:**
- Late 2024: Acquired Neiman Marcus for **$2.7B**
- Took on **$5B total obligations** to fund deal
- Amazon invested **$475M** equity stake
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly
- Interest rates climbed, luxury sales softened
- Liquidity crunch → delayed vendor payments
- Vendors pulled back shipments → inventory gaps
- Holiday 2025 season poor → shoppers went to competitors
- **Late Dec 2025:** Missed **$100M interest payment** — triggered crisis
- **Jan 14, 2026:** Chapter 11 filed
- **Jan 15, 2026:** Won $400M cash access after 7.5-hour court battle

**Vicious cycle:** Couldn't pay vendors → vendors stopped shipping → no inventory → no sales → couldn't pay vendors.

**Mark Weinsten (CRO, court filing):** Neiman deal led to "immediate liquidity challenges" and "unsustainable" capital structure.

**Mickey Chadha (Moody's):** "Recipe for disaster."

**David Swartz (Morningstar):** "This Saks-Neiman merger has been a disaster."

## Debt breakdown

**The $5B wasn't new debt — it included Neiman's legacy obligations:**

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Junk bonds** (new) | $2.2B | Issued to fund acquisition |
| **Bank loans** | $3.4B | Court filings |
| **Asset-based lending** | $1.8B | $1.1B drawn as of July 2025 |
| **Neiman legacy debt** | Assumed | From Apollo/One Equity Partners era |

**The hidden bomb:** Neiman Marcus came with **$5.5B in legacy debt** from prior private equity ownership. Saks assumed this burden on top of issuing new bonds.

**Interest expense explosion:**

| Period | Interest expense |
|--------|------------------|
| FY 2024 | $234M |
| Post-deal | **~$400M/year** (+70%) |

**Current bond trading levels:**

| Tranche | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Second-out notes ($941M) | **6 cents on dollar** |
| Senior debt ($762M) | **46 cents on dollar** |

**Secured creditors:** Private credit funds hold $4.2B in claims backed by inventory, real estate, and credit card portfolios.

## Amazon's $475M loss

**[[Amazon]] invested $475M in the Neiman acquisition — now "effectively worthless."**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | $475M equity stake |
| Current value | "Worthless" — Amazon |
| Response | Threatening "drastic remedies" |
| Demands | Examiner or trustee appointment |

**Jan 15 court hearing:** After 7.5-hour battle, Saks won access to ~$400M immediate cash. Amazon objected but lost first round. Must return for final approval of full $1.75B package.

## Restructuring

**New leadership team (Jan 14, 2026):**

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| **CEO** | Geoffroy van Raemdonck | Ex-Neiman CEO (replaces Richard Baker) |
| **President/CCO** | Darcy Penick | Ex-Bergdorf Goodman president |
| **Chief Brand Partnerships** | Lana Todorovich | Ex-Neiman CMO |

**Financing:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DIP financing | $1B (operations during Ch 11) |
| Exit financing | $500M committed |
| Total package | $1.75B |
| Expected exit | Later 2026 |

**Potential outcomes:**
- Creditors swap debt for equity
- Asset sales (Bergdorf likely to attract buyers)
- Store closures in mid-size cities
- Amazon equity likely wiped out

**Mary Ross Gilbert (Bloomberg Intelligence):** "Bergdorf is going to have a number of interested parties. It's really the luxe of luxe."
