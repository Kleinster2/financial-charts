## What happened

**Timeline:**
- Late 2024: Acquired Neiman Marcus for **$2.7B**
- Took on **$5B total obligations** to fund deal
- Amazon invested **$475M** equity stake
- Synergies didn't materialize quickly
- Interest rates climbed, luxury sales softened
- Liquidity crunch → delayed vendor payments
- Vendors pulled back shipments → inventory gaps
- Holiday 2025 season poor → shoppers went to competitors
- **Late Dec 2025:** Missed **$100M interest payment** — triggered crisis
- **Jan 14, 2026:** Chapter 11 filed
- **Jan 15, 2026:** Won $400M cash access after 7.5-hour court battle

**Vicious cycle:** Couldn't pay vendors → vendors stopped shipping → no inventory → no sales → couldn't pay vendors.

**Mark Weinsten (CRO, court filing):** Neiman deal led to "immediate liquidity challenges" and "unsustainable" capital structure.

**Mickey Chadha (Moody's):** "Recipe for disaster."

**David Swartz (Morningstar):** "This Saks-Neiman merger has been a disaster."

## Amazon's $475M loss

**[[Amazon]] invested $475M in the Neiman acquisition — now "effectively worthless."**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | $475M equity stake |
| Current value | "Worthless" — Amazon |
| Response | Threatening "drastic remedies" |
| Demands | Examiner or trustee appointment |

**Jan 15 court hearing:** After 7.5-hour battle, Saks won access to ~$400M immediate cash. Amazon objected but lost first round. Must return for final approval of full $1.75B package.

## Creditors

| Creditor | Amount owed |
|----------|-------------|
| **Amazon** | **$475M** (equity, likely wiped) |
| Chanel | $100M+ |
| Various fashion brands (via Hilldun) | $66M |
| Gift card holders | $320M |
| Bondholders | $2.2B+ |

**Gary Wassner (Hilldun Corp CEO):** Represents several dozen fashion brands owed ~$66M. Recovery depends on profitability post-emergence.

## Restructuring

**New leadership team (Jan 14, 2026):**

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| **CEO** | Geoffroy van Raemdonck | Ex-Neiman CEO (replaces Richard Baker) |
| **President/CCO** | Darcy Penick | Ex-Bergdorf Goodman president |
| **Chief Brand Partnerships** | Lana Todorovich | Ex-Neiman CMO |

**Financing:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DIP financing | $1B (operations during Ch 11) |
| Exit financing | $500M committed |
| Total package | $1.75B |
| Expected exit | Later 2026 |

**Potential outcomes:**
- Creditors swap debt for equity
- Asset sales (Bergdorf likely to attract buyers)
- Store closures in mid-size cities
- Amazon equity likely wiped out

**Mary Ross Gilbert (Bloomberg Intelligence):** "Bergdorf is going to have a number of interested parties. It's really the luxe of luxe."

## Beneficiaries

| Competitor | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Macy's / Bloomingdale's** | Sales increase as Saks customers defect |
| Nordstrom | Luxury department alternative |

## Investment implications

**Direct:**
- Bonds trading at distressed levels
- Vendor exposure (fashion brands, Chanel)

**Indirect:**
- Luxury retail stress signal
- Department store model struggles continue
- [[Credit markets]] — another failed LBO/bond deal
