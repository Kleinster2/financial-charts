## Fifth Avenue flagship

The crown jewel asset — worth more than the entire company was bought for. See [[611 Fifth Avenue]] for full building details.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Building | [[611 Fifth Avenue]] (1924 store) + [[623 Fifth Avenue]] (1990 tower) |
| Opened | September 15, 1924 |
| Retail size | ~650,000 sq ft |
| Architect | Starrett & van Vleck |
| Style | Neo-Renaissance palazzo, Indiana limestone |
| Landmark status | NYC designated 1984 |

### The valuation rollercoaster

| Year | Appraisal | Key driver |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **2014** | **$3.7B** | Peak Fifth Ave rents, retail optimism |
| **2019** | **$1.6B** | E-commerce disruption, rent collapse (-57%) |
| **2024** | **$3.6B** | Luxury buying spree, tourism recovery (+125%) |

**Context:** HBC bought all of Saks for $2.9B in 2013. The flagship alone has consistently been worth more than that entire acquisition.

### 100-year history

**1924 — The dream store:**
Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel (cousins, rival Herald Square merchants) opened the flagship on Sept 15, 1924. First large retailer to locate in what was then residential Fifth Avenue. Won Fifth Avenue Association gold medal for "best new building." Horace Saks died suddenly in 1926 (age ~34).

**Ownership carousel:**

| Year | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1923 | Gimbel Brothers | Merger |
| 1973 | Brown & Williamson | Tobacco conglomerate |
| 1990 | Investcorp | PE; 36-story tower added |
| 1998 | Proffitt's/Saks Inc. | Public company |
| **2013** | **HBC / [[Richard Baker]]** | **$2.9B for entire chain** |

**2014 — "Most valuable retail building in the world":**
- $3.7B appraisal
- HBC **originated** $1.25B [[ground lease]] mortgage (not assumed existing debt)
  - Collateral: Land + ground lease only (NOT the building)
  - Terms: 20-year, interest-only, fixed <4.40%
  - Lenders: BofA, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Nova Scotia
  - Use of proceeds: Paid down $1.2B floating-rate corporate debt (4.75%)
- Annual rent: $108M
- Baker: "This valuation seems to indicate that it's the single most-valuable retail building in the world."

**2019 — Retail apocalypse:**
- $1.6B appraisal (-57%)
- Annual rent capacity dropped to $84M (-22%)
- [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] rents down 18% from 2015 peak
- CBRE scenarios: as-is $1.6B, vacated $250M, subdivided $1.18B

**2024 — Recovery:**
- $3.6B appraisal (back to within 3% of 2014 peak)
- Driven by [[Kering]], [[Prada]], [[LVMH]] buying Fifth Ave properties
- Fifth Ave rents hit $2,500/sq ft (world's most expensive)

### Bankruptcy collateral

In bankruptcy, the flagship became central collateral for $1.75B [[DIP financing]] — subordinating [[Amazon]]'s $475M equity stake behind bondholders. See [[Saks bankruptcy]] for the courtroom fight.

## Debt timeline

| Date | Event | Amount | Detail |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **2013** | Saks acquisition | $2.9B | HBC buys entire chain |
| **Nov 2014** | [[Ground lease]] mortgage | $1.25B | 20-year, interest-only; collateral = ground only (NOT building) |
| **Mar 2020** | HBC privatization | $1.1B | Baker took company private at $11/share |
| **2021** | Saks.com spinoff | $500M | Insight Partners invested; digital separated from stores |
| **Aug 2024** | Flagship refinancing | $600M | Used [[611 Fifth Avenue]] — **without [[Amazon]] consent** |
| **Dec 2024** | [[Saks-Neiman merger]] bonds | $2.2B | 11% senior secured notes, due 2029 |
| **Aug 2025** | Debt exchange | $600M | 98% of bondholders swapped for lower principal; $300M new loan |
| **Dec 2025** | Missed interest payment | $100M | Triggered default |
| **Jan 2026** | [[Saks bankruptcy]] / [[DIP financing]] | $1.75B | Flagship pledged as collateral |

**The August 2025 exchange bought 5 months:** With bonds trading at ~30 cents on dollar, Saks convinced bondholders to swap $2.2B in 11% notes for securities with lower principal in exchange for $200M new financing. Not enough to avoid Chapter 11.
