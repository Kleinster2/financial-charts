## The three signature deals

### 1. TNK-BP → Rosneft ($28B exit)

In the 1990s, Blavatnik and partners (Fridman, Vekselberg — the "AAR consortium") acquired Russian oil assets during privatization. In 2003, they formed TNK-BP as a 50/50 JV with BP — one of the largest foreign investments in Russian history. In 2013, Rosneft (state-backed) bought AAR's 50% stake for $27.7B in cash. This was Blavatnik's biggest single payday.

**Controversy**: The deal was signed off at a meeting with Putin. Critics (Guardian, Oxford professors) questioned whether Blavatnik's fortune was built on proximity to Russian state power. He's a US citizen who was living in New York at the time.

### 2. LyondellBasell — "greatest deal in Wall Street history"

Blavatnik orchestrated the $20B merger of Basell (which he owned) with Lyondell Chemical in 2007. The combined company went bankrupt in 2009 (bad timing — financial crisis + commodity crash). Instead of walking away, Blavatnik invested another $2.37B personally during bankruptcy.

Apollo Global also invested $2B during the restructuring, turned it into $12B, and sold. Blavatnik bought Apollo's shares as they exited ("If Apollo is selling, why are you buying?" people asked). His personal profit: **~$8B** from a single asset. Forbes in 2014: "the biggest individual score from a single deal, ever."

### 3. Warner Music Group — the contrarian music bet

Bought WMG for $3.3B in 2011 when consensus said streaming was killing the music industry. Re-IPO'd in June 2020 at ~$15B valuation. Current stake (~72% economic) worth ~$10-11B. **~3-4x return** and he still controls it with 98% voting power via [[Dual-class shares]].

## Investment style

| Trait | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| **Contrarian** | Buys when others sell (WMG in 2011, LyondellBasell in bankruptcy) |
| **Doubles down** | Adds to positions others are exiting (bought Apollo's LyondellBasell shares) |
| **Control-oriented** | Dual-class structures, majority stakes, long hold periods |
| **Patient** | Holds for decades, no activist pressure |
| **Sector-agnostic** | Chemicals, music, sports, tech, biotech — goes where the value is |

## Philanthropy

$1.3B+ given or pledged to 250+ institutions over the past decade:

| Institution | Gift | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Oxford University | £75M | Blavatnik School of Government |
| Harvard | Multiple | Business school, various |
| Stanford | Multiple | Various |
| Yale | Multiple | Various |
| Tate Modern | Major donor | Arts |
| USC | $25M (2025) | Virtual production center |

The Oxford gift was controversial — faculty members resigned in protest over accepting money linked to Russian privatization-era wealth.
