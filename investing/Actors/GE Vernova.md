**GE Vernova** — Largest gas turbine manufacturer. Critical bottleneck for AI power buildout.

---

## Why GE Vernova matters

GE Vernova is THE chokepoint for fast-deploying AI data center power:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#1 gas turbine manufacturer |
| Market share | ~35% (with [[Siemens]], Mitsubishi = 70%+) |
| Waitlist | 3-5 years for LM6000 |
| Stock performance | +239% past year |

## The bottleneck

**Gas turbines can't be built fast enough:**

> "There just aren't enough gas turbines to go around and the problem is probably going to get worse." — Paul Browning (ex-GE Power CEO)

| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Current capacity | ~55 heavy-duty turbines/year |
| Expanding to | 70-80/year by 2026 |
| Demand | Far exceeds supply |
| Projects at risk | $400B+ through end of decade |

---

## AI data center deals

| Partner | Deal | Capacity |
|---------|------|----------|
| **[[Crusoe Energy]]** | 29 LM2500XPRESS turbines | ~1 GW |
| **[[Chevron]]** | 7 HA turbines | 4 GW by 2027 |
| **NRG Energy** | JV | Up to 5.4 GW |
| **[[NextEra Energy]]** | Collaboration | "Gigawatts" |

GE Vernova is powering the AI buildout.

## Product portfolio

| Turbine | Type | Use case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **LM2500XPRESS** | Aeroderivative | Fast-deploy DC power |
| **LM6000** | Aeroderivative | Peaker, DC power |
| **7HA** | Heavy-duty | Baseload, combined cycle |
| **9HA** | Heavy-duty | Largest, utility scale |

**Aeroderivatives** (jet engine-derived) are hot for data centers — faster to deploy than heavy-duty.

## Crusoe partnership

**29-unit deal (2024-2025):**
- 10 units ordered Dec 2024
- 19 units ordered Jun 2025
- LM2500XPRESS aeroderivative
- Powers [[Crusoe Energy]] AI data centers
- ~1 GW total capacity

This is the template for gas-powered AI infrastructure.

## Capacity expansion

**$300M investment announced:**
- South Carolina expansion
- New York expansion
- [[Target]]: 70-80 heavy-duty turbines/year (from 55)
- Still won't meet demand

---

## Spin-off from GE

**GE Vernova spun off April 2024:**
- Power, renewables, electrification businesses
- Pure-play energy company
- No longer conglomerate discount
- Stock has rerated significantly

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Oligopoly (3 players = 70%+ share)
- 3-5 year backlog = visibility
- AI power demand secular
- Capacity expansion underway
- Stock momentum

**Bear:**
- Valuation stretched after +239%
- Execution risk on capacity expansion
- Long-term: renewables/nuclear competition
- Cyclical business historically
