# Fast Retailing

**World's third-largest fashion retailer** (behind Inditex and H&M by revenue, but \#1 by market cap at times). ¥3.4T (~$22B) revenue in FY2025 (Aug year-end), +13% growth. Uniqlo is the core brand (~85% of revenue). Founder Tadashi Yanai is [[Japan]]'s richest person (~$42B). 3,600+ stores globally. "LifeWear" positioning — functional, high-quality basics at accessible prices. Not fashion-forward, but engineered essentials.

## Uniqlo International — the growth engine

| Region | Stores | Growth | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Greater [[China]] | ~1,000 | Recovering | Largest international market |
| [[Southeast Asia]] | 400+ | +20%+ | Fastest growing |
| [[Europe]] | 100+ | +30%+ | Early, high growth |
| North America | 70+ | Growing | Underpenetrated |
| South Korea | 130+ | Stable | Mature |

**[[Europe]] and North America are the whitespace.** Uniqlo has <200 stores combined vs Zara's 2,000+ in those markets.

## Uniqlo vs. peers

| Factor | Uniqlo | [[Inditex]]/Zara | [[H&M]] |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------|
| Positioning | Functional basics | Fast fashion/trend | Value fashion |
| Price point | Mid ($20-$100) | Mid-high | Low-mid |
| Speed to market | Seasonal | 2 weeks | 2-3 weeks |
| Innovation | HeatTech, AIRism, LifeWear | Trend replication | — |
| Revenue growth | +13% | +10.5% | +1% |

Uniqlo doesn't compete on trends — it competes on material innovation and functional design. Different business model than fast fashion.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Double-digit growth with expanding margins
- [[Europe]]/North America massively underpenetrated
- Not fast fashion — "LifeWear" immune to trend risk
- Material innovation moat (HeatTech, AIRism)
- Yanai's operational intensity
- ~$90B market cap = priced as luxury, growing like it

**Bear:**
- Trading at ~35x PE — richly valued for a retailer
- [[China]] recovery uncertain (~1,000 stores exposed)
- Yanai is 75 — succession unclear
- Currency headwinds (yen weakness flatters international)
- North America execution risk (small presence, high competition)
- GU not working internationally
