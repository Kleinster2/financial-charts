## Sector correlation

> [!warning] Sector Orphan
> NU does not trade with US fintech names. LatAm story dominates.

| Sector | Correlation | Fit |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| [[US Retail Trading]] (SOFI, HOOD, COIN) | 0.37-0.46 | Weak |
| [[Payments Networks]] (V, MA) | 0.28-0.31 | Weak |

NU trades on Brazil macro, BRL/USD, and LatAm fintech adoption — not US fintech sentiment. Despite being a "neobank," it has more in common with emerging market banks than SOFI or HOOD.
