Global independent investment bank providing M&A, restructuring, and capital markets advisory.

## Price

![[mc-vs-evr-vs-hli-price-chart.png]]
*MC (blue) vs [[Evercore]] and [[Houlihan Lokey]] since 2020. All three benefiting from the M&A/restructuring cycle, but MC has lagged peers — +260% vs EVR +460% and HLI +380%. The gap reflects MC's higher comp ratio and smaller scale.*

## Financials

![[mc-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked in the 2021 SPAC/M&A boom, contracted through 2022-2023, then recovered sharply in 2024-2025. Q4 2025 revenue of $488M approached the 2021 highs. Net income volatile due to comp structure — advisory firms pay out most revenue as compensation.*
