# H&M

**World's second-largest fashion retailer** (behind [[Inditex]]). SEK 234.6B (~$22B) revenue in 2024, +1% — essentially flat growth. Struggling with structural challenges: slower than Zara (Inditex +10.5%), squeezed by Shein on ultra-cheap end, margin pressure from inventory management issues. CEO Daniel Ervér (since Jan 2024). 4,369 stores globally. Gross margin ~53% vs Inditex's 58%. Restructuring ongoing.

## Financial performance

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue (SEK B) | 223.6 | 232.2 | 234.6 |
| Revenue growth | +6% | +4% | +1% |
| Gross margin | 50.4% | 52.6% | ~53% |
| Operating margin | 5.2% | 7.2% | ~8% |
| Net income (SEK B) | 3.6 | 9.0 | ~10 |

**Margins recovering but growth stalling.** H&M's problem is top-line, not profitability per se — the company is improving operations but can't grow.

## H&M vs. Inditex (Zara)

| Factor | H&M | [[Inditex]] |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Revenue | ~$22B | €38.6B (~$42B) |
| Revenue growth (2024) | +1% | +10.5% |
| Gross margin | ~53% | 57.8% |
| Operating margin | ~8% | ~20% |
| Supply chain speed | 2-3 weeks | 2 weeks |
| Store count | 4,369 | 5,563 |
| Online share | ~30% | ~25% |

**Inditex is pulling away.** Zara's faster supply chain, higher full-price selling, and better store locations create structural advantages.

## Competitive pressures

| Threat | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **[[Inditex]]/Zara** | Faster, better margins, gaining share |
| **Shein** | Ultra-fast, ultra-cheap, Gen Z magnet |
| **Temu** | Chinese cross-border ultra-cheap |
| **Primark** | Physical store value player |
| **Dupe economy** | Mass consumers trade down |

H&M is squeezed in the middle: not fast/cheap enough to compete with Shein, not elevated enough to compete with Zara's premium positioning.

## Strategy under Ervér

| Initiative | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Fewer, better stores | Closing underperformers |
| Brand portfolio | COS, & Other Stories, ARKET (premium) |
| Speed-to-market | Improving but still behind Zara |
| Sustainability | Circulose, recycled materials |
| AI/data | Demand forecasting, personalization |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Margin recovery (+1% → +8% operating in 2 years)
- Premium brands (COS) growing faster than core
- Valuation discount to Inditex (~14x PE vs ~28x)
- New CEO = fresh strategy
- Online growing (+5-6%)
- Dividend yield ~4%

**Bear:**
- Revenue growth essentially zero (+1%)
- Structural disadvantage vs Inditex (speed, margins)
- Shein/Temu disruption on value end
- No clear right-to-win in any segment
- Fast fashion facing [[ESG]]/regulatory headwinds ([[EU]] textile waste laws)
- Family control limits strategic optionality
