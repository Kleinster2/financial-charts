## Jan 27, 2026: Medicare rate shock spillover

**Stock fell ~11%** — dragged down by sector-wide [[Medicare Advantage]] rate shock.

### CVS-specific context

**Less exposed than pure-plays:** Medicare Advantage is ~25% of Aetna revenue (vs 85% for [[Humana]]). Diversified across PBM + retail.

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Aetna MBR | Spiked >90% in 2024, stabilizing |
| Medicare markets | Exiting underperformers |
| Q3 2025 | -$4B quarterly loss (impairments) |

**Analyst view:** Maintain 'Strong Buy' with 22.7% adjusted EPS growth expected despite MA headwinds — diversification provides buffer.

*Middle of the pack at +38% since 2020. Less MA-exposed than [[Humana|HUM]] (-19%) but underperforming [[Cigna|CI]] (+80%) and [[UnitedHealth|UNH]] (+60%). vs XLV.*

## Financials

![[cvs-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue growing but margins volatile. Q3 2025 loss (-$4B) from Aetna Medicare Advantage challenges and impairments.*

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Margin |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| 2024 | $373B | $4.6B | 1.2% |
| 2023 | $358B | $8.3B | 2.3% |
| 2022 | $322B | $4.3B | 1.3% |
| 2021 | $292B | $8.0B | 2.7% |

*Thin margins typical for pharmacy/PBM businesses. Aetna headwinds compressing further.*
