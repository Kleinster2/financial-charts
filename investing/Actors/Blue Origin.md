## Why Blue Origin matters

| Business | Status | Relevance |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **New Glenn** | First launch 2024 | Heavy-lift rocket |
| **New Shepard** | **Paused** (Jan 2026) | Suborbital tourism |
| **Blue Moon** | NASA contract | [[Artemis]] V lander ($3.4B) |
| **[[Space]] data centers** | Vision | 10-20 year timeline |

## New Shepard pause (Jan 2026)

**Halting space tourism to focus on lunar program:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | Jan 30, 2026 |
| Duration | **2+ years minimum** |
| Last flight | Jan 22, 2026 |
| Reason | Redirect resources to [[Artemis]] lunar lander |

New Shepard flew 38 missions, carried 98 humans above Kármán line (including Bezos, Shatner, Katy Perry, Michael Strahan).

**Signal:** Blue Origin prioritizing $3.4B NASA contract over tourism revenue. Blue Moon Mk 1 uncrewed lunar landing targeted for 2026; Mk 2 crewed lander for [[Artemis]] V (~2030).

## [[Artemis]] lunar lander

**Blue Moon program:**

| Variant | Mission | Timeline |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Mk 1** | Uncrewed demo + VIPER delivery | 2026 |
| **Mk 2** | Crewed landing ([[Artemis]] V) | ~2030 |

| Financial | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| NASA contract | **$3.4B** |
| Blue Origin contribution | $3.5B+ additional |
| Total development | ~$7B |

Second human landing system after [[SpaceX]] Starship HLS.

## [[Space]] data center vision

**Bezos promoting orbital compute:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Timeline | **10-20 years** (Bezos, Oct 2025) |
| Quote | "I bet it's not more than 20 years" |
| Strategy | More conservative than Musk |

**Why space:**
- 24/7 solar power
- Bypass Earth [[Power constraints]]
- No land/permitting constraints

See [[Space data centers]] for full concept.

## New Glenn rocket

**Heavy-lift vehicle:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Payload to LEO | 45,000 kg |
| Reusability | First stage |
| First launch | 2024 |
| Engines | BE-4 (methane) |

Competitor to SpaceX Falcon Heavy and Starship.

## Jeff Bezos

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | Founder, Executive Chairman |
| Funding | ~$1B+/year personal investment |
| Other | Amazon founder, Washington Post owner |

Blue Origin funded primarily by Bezos selling Amazon stock.

## vs SpaceX

| Factor | Blue Origin | SpaceX |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Pace | Slower, methodical | Fast, iterative |
| Philosophy | "Gradatim Ferociter" (step by step) | "Move fast, break things" |
| Launch cadence | Low | High (Falcon 9 dominance) |
| [[Space]] DCs | 10-20 years | 4-5 years (Musk) |
| Funding | Bezos personal | Private + govt contracts |

SpaceX far ahead on execution; Blue Origin catching up.

## Investment case

**Not investable** — private, Bezos-funded.

**Watch for:**
- IPO unlikely near-term
- Amazon Kuiper (separate, within Amazon)
- [[Space]] DC progress
