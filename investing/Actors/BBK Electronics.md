## Memory shortage exposure (Jan 2026)

All BBK brands face same margin pressures from DRAM shortage:

| Brand | Nov Forecast | Jan Forecast | Revision |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Oppo | +2% | -1% | **-3pp** |
| Vivo | +1% | -1% | **-2pp** |

**Vulnerability:** Low margins across portfolio, heavy entry-level exposure, limited pricing power vs Apple/Samsung.

## Why it matters

BBK's structure obscures its true market power — when combined, it rivals Samsung in volume. But the multi-brand strategy means:
- No single brand has Apple/Samsung scale advantages
- Each brand competes for same cost-sensitive customers
- Margin pressure hits all brands simultaneously
- Memory shortage impacts aggregate more than any single competitor

## For theses

- [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] — conglomerate-wide vulnerability
- [[Memory shortage victims]] — all brands low-margin
