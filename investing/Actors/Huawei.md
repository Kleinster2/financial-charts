# Huawei

Chinese tech conglomerate and primary target of US export controls. Developing indigenous chips (Kirin, Ascend) despite restrictions. Proof case for China's ability to work around sanctions.

---

## Why it matters

Huawei is the test case for export control effectiveness:
- **Kirin 9000S**: 7nm chip in Mate 60 Pro despite US sanctions
- **Ascend AI chips**: Competing with NVIDIA A100 in China
- **HiSilicon**: Fabless design arm, once top-10 globally

If Huawei succeeds, it validates China's indigenous chip strategy. If it stagnates, it proves restrictions work.

## Chip portfolio

### Mobile (Kirin)
| Chip | Node | Foundry | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Kirin 9000S | 7nm | SMIC | Shipping (Mate 60 Pro) |
| Kirin 9100 | 5nm? | SMIC | Rumored 2025-26 |

**How they did it**: SMIC multi-patterning on DUV (no EUV). Lower yields, higher cost, but functional.

### AI/Data center (Ascend)
| Chip | Comparison | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Ascend 910B | ~A100 performance | Shipping |
| Ascend 910C | Improved 910B | Shipping |
| Ascend 920 | Target H100 | Development |

**Adoption**: Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent using for domestic AI training. Not export-competitive but sufficient for China market.

### Networking
- Still major 5G equipment provider (outside US/allies)
- Banned from US, UK, Australia, others

---

## Supply chain

| Component | Source | Constraint |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Foundry | SMIC | Stuck at 7nm, N5 very limited |
| Memory | Domestic + stockpiles | HBM shortage |
| EDA tools | Domestic alternatives | Years behind Synopsys/Cadence |
| Equipment | Stockpiled + domestic | ASML EUV banned |

**Key constraint**: Cannot access leading-edge nodes. SMIC 7nm is 4-5 years behind TSMC N3.

---

## Strategic positioning

### Strengths
- Massive domestic market (1.4B people)
- Government backing (Big Fund, policy support)
- Proven workaround capability (Kirin 9000S)
- Vertical integration (HiSilicon design + Huawei systems)

### Weaknesses
- Cut off from TSMC, Samsung foundry
- EDA tools lagging
- HBM supply limited
- Export markets shrinking

## Export control history

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| May 2019 | Added to Entity List |
| Aug 2020 | FDPR extended — cut off from TSMC |
| Dec 2020 | SMIC added to Entity List |
| Sep 2023 | Mate 60 Pro launch — proved workaround |
| 2024-25 | Continued restrictions, Ascend adoption grows |

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | Huawei was major customer, now lost |
| [[Long WFE]] | China equipment demand partly driven by Huawei alternatives |
| [[Export controls]] | Huawei success = controls failing; struggle = controls working |

---

## What to watch

- [ ] Kirin next-gen node (5nm on SMIC?)
- [ ] Ascend 920 vs H100 benchmarks
- [ ] Huawei cloud AI adoption in China
- [ ] SMIC yield improvements
- [ ] Potential export control tightening
