## MAU trajectory

| Date | MAU | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Nov 17, 2025 | Launch | Public beta |
| Nov 24, 2025 | 10M downloads | First week |
| Nov 2025 | 18.[[3M]] | +149% MoM |
| Dec 2025 | 30M | Early month |
| **Jan 2026** | **100M+** | Current |

**vs competitors (Nov 2025):**

| App | MAU |
|-----|-----|
| [[Doubao]] | 168M |
| [[DeepSeek]] | ~143M |
| **Qwen** | **100M+** |
| [[Tencent]] Yuanbao | 73M |

Qwen closed the gap fast — from 18M to 100M in ~2 months.

## Pricing

| Tier | Cost |
|------|------|
| API (input) | $0.20-$1.20 per M tokens |
| vs GPT-4.5 | **~0.2%** of cost |
| vs DeepSeek V3 | ~40% of cost |
| Open weights | Free (Apache 2.0) |

Alibaba undercutting everyone on price while open-sourcing the models.

## Distribution

| Channel | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Qwen App | [[Consumer]] chatbot (100M+ MAU) |
| Alibaba Cloud | Enterprise API |
| [[Hugging Face]] | Open weights |
| [[Taobao]]/Tmall | E-commerce integration |
| DingTalk | Enterprise messaging |

**Key advantage:** Alibaba's cloud + commerce ecosystem for distribution.

---

## Open source strategy

**Alibaba's thesis:** Sacrifice short-term API revenue for global adoption.

| Approach | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Apache 2.0 license | Anyone can use commercially |
| Full model weights | Not just API access |
| Multiple sizes | 0.6B to 480B+ |
| Regular releases | Qwen3 family expanding |

**Result:** Qwen + [[DeepSeek]] = 30% of global AI model usage.

## Competitive position

| vs | Qwen advantage | Disadvantage |
|----|---------------|--------------|
| [[Doubao]] | Open source, enterprise | Less consumer distribution |
| [[DeepSeek]] | Alibaba resources, multimodal | Less efficiency cred |
| [[ChatGPT]] | Price, open weights | Brand, global reach |
| [[Claude]] | Price, agentic benchmarks | Less polish |

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Qwen is an Alibaba product.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Alibaba]] (BABA/9988.HK) — parent, directly benefits
- [[NVIDIA]] — Alibaba GPU customer

**Thesis implications:**
- Open source winning in [[China]]
- Alibaba Cloud differentiated by AI
- Price war compressing API margins globally
