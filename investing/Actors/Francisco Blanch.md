## Current views (Feb 2026)

**Oil:** Bearish. Expects ~2M bpd surplus in 2026, Brent avg $60 (down from $68 in 2025). Structural floor from low inventories outside [[China]] and strategic reserve buying. Global consumption projected to hit 108M bpd by 2031 (from 104M in 2025).

**[[Natural gas]]:** Neutral. $4/MMBtu Henry Hub forecast.

**Electricity:** Bullish. Key theme: "electrons over molecules." Sees AI exposure in [[Commodities]] primarily via electricity, particularly [[PJM]] market.

**Gold:** $4,000 target (set mid-2025).

**Industrial metals:** Bullish into 2026+.

**Geopolitical risk:** [[Russia]]-[[Ukraine]] peace deal with sanctions relief would be "pretty bearish for commodity markets broadly, particularly for oil and gas."
