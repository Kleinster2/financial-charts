IPO speculation ongoing — banks pitching London listing aggressively. Francis met UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Oct 2025) for listing discussions. No filing as of early 2026.

## Competitive positioning

| Factor | Gymshark | [[Vuori]] | [[Alo Yoga]] | [[Lululemon]] |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Revenue | ~£607M | Undisclosed | ~$1B (est.) | $10.6B |
| Target | Gym/fitness (Gen Z) | Men's casual | Women's yoga/lifestyle | Women's performance |
| Distribution | DTC + emerging retail | DTC + retail | DTC + retail | Omnichannel |
| Ownership | Private | Private | Private | Public |

Gymshark's core audience skews younger and more gym-focused than [[Athleisure]] peers. Social media community (~18M followers) is the primary moat.
