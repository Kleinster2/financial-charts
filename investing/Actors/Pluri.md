## Business segments

### 1. Cell therapy (PLX platform)

PLX-PAD — placental mesenchymal-like stromal cells:

| Indication | Phase | Status | Key data |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Hip fracture (muscle recovery) | III | Completed | Significant hip abduction strength increase vs placebo; 296m vs 266m 6-min walk (week 52). EU Horizon 2020 grant: EUR 7.4M |
| Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) | III | Terminated (interim) | Post-analysis: statistically significant reduction in amputation/death in non-diabetic/well-controlled patients at 12 months. EU grant: EUR 7.6M |
| Knee osteoarthritis | I | Ongoing (Charite Berlin, PROTO initiative) | EU Horizon Europe grant: EUR 7.5M |
| Steroid-refractory chronic GvHD | I/II | Ongoing (Tel Aviv Sourasky MC) | Investigator-initiated |

PLX-R18 — hematopoietic regeneration cells:

| Indication | Phase | Status | Key data |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) | Preclinical/IND | FDA IND cleared, Orphan Drug Designation | Animal studies: high efficacy recovering all three blood cell counts, increased survival |
| Poor graft function post-transplant | I (completed) | N=21, US/Israel | Mortality reduction 29% → 18%. Statistically significant increase in HGB and platelets at months 6 and 12. Reduced transfusion requirements |

PLX-R18 ARS program had US Department of Defense collaboration (data presented 2019).

### 2. MAIT cell immunotherapy

Emerging platform for "off-the-shelf" cancer immunotherapy. MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T) cells from placenta expanded at scale using the 3D platform. Targets solid tumors. Immune cell engineering market projected at $11.7B by 2030 (third-party estimate).

IP: China patent (CN 119301238 B) granted Feb 2026 for large-scale immune cell expansion and activation. Complements prior US patent. Global family covers US, [[China]], [[Japan]], Korea, Australia, [[Israel]].

### 3. PluriCDMO

Contract development and manufacturing services leveraging the 3D cell expansion platform. Key engagement: [[Resbiomed]] collaboration for placenta-derived collagen-rich biomaterials for regenerative medicine. First phase completed Jan 2026 — process development and feasibility assessments. Advancing to next phase.

### 4. AgTech / cultivated food (Kokomodo)

Acquired ~71% of [[Kokomodo]] Ltd. (cultivated cacao) in April 2025 for $4.5M in Pluri common shares. Kokomodo operates as independent subsidiary under CEO Tal Govrin.

Key milestones:
- Collaboration with [[Cargill]] to explore cell-based cacao across beverages, dairy, confectionery (sensory, scalability)
- International strategic collaborations across Asia, Europe, US — collaborator-funded MVP/POC for scale-up validation (announced Nov 2025)
- Also developing cultivated coffee
- Regulatory submission planned for 2026 (FDA pathway)
- $300K SAFE raised at Kokomodo level (Dec 2025)

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (9 months FY2025) | $938K (vs $230K prior year — ~4x growth) |
| Revenue (TTM, Dec 2025) | $1.34M |
| Revenue (H1 FY2026, ending Dec 2025) | ~$5.3M (broadly flat) |
| Cash (Dec 31, 2025) | $13.6M |
| Working capital | Deficit |
| Going concern | Substantial doubt — <6 months runway from Feb 12, 2026 |

Revenue growth driven by PluriCDMO and AgTech POC collaborations. Still deeply pre-revenue relative to operating costs.

Dec 2025 capital raises:
- $2.5M private placement
- $300K SAFE ([[Kokomodo]] subsidiary)

CEO compensation: Board approved 30% monthly cash salary reduction for Yaky Yanay (NIS 59,400/month) for Jan–Feb 2026.

Nasdaq compliance: Notice received Jan 20, 2026 for not meeting $35M market value of listed securities requirement.

## Analysis

Pluri is a platform-technology company trying to monetize a single core capability (3D placenta-derived cell expansion) across four vertically different markets. The technology appears genuine — EU grants, DoD collaboration, Phase III data, and a growing patent portfolio lend credibility. But the commercialization challenge is immense: the company has $1.34M in TTM revenue against what appears to be $20M+ annual cash burn.

The going concern notice is the dominant near-term reality. With $13.6M in cash and <6 months runway (management's own estimate), Pluri needs either a significant capital raise, a licensing deal, or a strategic transaction in 2026 to survive. The Dec 2025 $2.5M raise barely moves the needle.

The Kokomodo/cultivated cacao angle is the most commercially proximate — Cargill collaboration, multiple funded POCs, and a 2026 regulatory submission suggest this could be the first revenue-generating business at meaningful scale. But "regulatory submission planned" is not "revenue," and the path from POC to commercial product in food tech typically takes years.

The MAIT cell immunotherapy IP could be strategically valuable — China + US patents covering scalable immune cell manufacturing position Pluri as a potential CDMO or licensing partner for cell therapy companies. Whether the company survives long enough to realize that value is the question.

Risk profile: binary. Either the platform gets validated through a partnership or capital injection, or the company runs out of cash. The ~$119M market cap suggests the market is pricing in some probability of the former.
