|-----------|--------|
| LinkNYC Wi-Fi | 2,204 kiosks |
| Subway cellular | 418 miles |
| [[5G]] expansion | Ongoing |
| Fiber backbone | Building out |

### Vendor: Boldyn Networks

| Project | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Subway expansion | Full system coverage |
| LinkNYC | Infrastructure partner |
| [[5G]] | Deployment |

## Data infrastructure

### Scale

| Data source | Volume |
|-------------|--------|
| LinkNYC | 17M+ subscriber records, 1M+ daily sessions |
| 311 system | 30M+ service requests (cumulative) |
| Subway sensors | [[3M]]+ daily rider movements |
| Traffic cameras | 10,000+ feeds |
| Open data portal | 2,400+ datasets |

### Storage & processing

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **NYC data centers** | Citywide IT Services (CWITS) operates municipal DCs |
| **Primary DC** | Brooklyn Army Terminal facility |
| **Cloud migration** | Hybrid approach (on-prem + cloud) |
| **Backup** | Geo-redundant across boroughs |

### Vendor infrastructure

| Operator | Data handling |
|----------|---------------|
| **Intersection (LinkNYC)** | [[Google]] Cloud (Alphabet parent) |
| **Boldyn Networks** | Transit connectivity data |
| **Hudson Yards** | Private data center in development |
| **[[Cloudflare]]** | WAF, DDoS protection for city agencies |

### Cloudflare relationship

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Client | NYC Government Financial Agency (~300K users) |
| Services | WAF, Application DDoS, exploring Zero Trust |
| Protection | **500M malicious requests blocked/month** |
| Edge blocking | 76% of attacks stopped at edge |
| Deployment speed | Active mitigation in <2 hours |
| Origin of attacks | 53% from outside US |

**Investment angle:** Cloudflare provides critical security layer for NYC's digital infrastructure. As smart city attack surface expands (LinkNYC, 311, open data), edge security becomes essential.

### Data governance

| Policy | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Open data law** | Local Law 11 (2012) mandates public datasets |
| **Privacy** | LinkNYC collects anonymized, aggregated data only |
| **Retention** | Varies by system (311: 7 years, 911: permanent) |
| **Sharing** | NYC Open Data portal (2,400+ datasets public) |

### Investment angle

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **[[Google]] Cloud** | Alphabet benefits from Intersection data flow |
| **Edge computing** | Link5G kiosks enable edge processing |
| **Data gravity** | NYC data stays in-region (latency, compliance) |
| **AI training** | Anonymized urban data valuable for smart city AI |
