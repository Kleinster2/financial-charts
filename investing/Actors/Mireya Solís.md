## Key views (Feb 2026)

**On Takaichi's election:**
- "Historic" and "thunderbolt" — first female leader of Japan, achieved LDP supermajority alone (without [[Komeito]] coalition partner for first time in 26 years)
- Best performance in LDP's 70-year history
- Gives Takaichi free reign: no new national election needed for years, can override upper house
- Enormous mandate but markets haven't given a matching one

**On Takaichi vs Abe:**
- Abe focused on monetary easing ([[BOJ]] "Kuroda bazooka") and was restrained on fiscal policy
- Takaichi is more interventionist: big government role, targeted fiscal spending, industrial policy at scale
- Different context: Abe governed in deflation, Takaichi governs in inflation
- For the first time, defense industry identified as priority industrial policy sector — [[Japan]] as defense exporter is new

**On fiscal risk:**
- The main constraint on Takaichi's agenda. Bond markets nervous after she floated a 2-year food consumption tax suspension during campaign
- Once suspended, politically difficult to reinstate
- She's spending more AND potentially taxing less — markets see the arithmetic
- How she navigates fiscal ambition vs bond market discipline is "the story to follow"

**On the lost decades narrative:**
- "Overused image" — significant change happened beneath the surface during the lost decades
- Corporate governance reform showed real progress
- Womenomics produced high female labor participation
- "Undercurrents of change have repositioned where Japan stands today"

**On demographics:**
- Japan brought women, elderly, and foreign workers into the workforce
- But absolute population decline is the serious structural challenge
- Capital market reform can help channel investment into automation and productivity
