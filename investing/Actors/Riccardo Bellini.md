## Track record

**Maison Margiela:** Took over during rocky period after John Galliano's onboarding. Stabilized operations, grew revenue over 100%. Handed off a functional business.

**Chloé:** Four-year tenure focused on sustainability and craft. Achieved B Corp certification (Oct 2021). Worked with Gabriela Hearst on elevated positioning, then hired [[Chemena Kamali]] to revive boho-chic aesthetic.

**Pattern:** Bellini specializes in mid-sized luxury houses needing operational discipline and brand repositioning. Not a cost-cutter — focuses on sustainable growth and creative partnerships.

## Valentino mandate

Appointed to fix a declining business:
- Revenue falling, profits down sharply
- Covenant breach required emergency capital
- Ownership transition postponed to 2028-2029

**Advantages:**
- Trust of [[Mayhoola]] (was their MD)
- Strong rapport with creative director [[Alessandro Michele]] (who transformed Gucci)
- Proven turnaround credentials

**Challenge:** Stabilize financials before put/call options come due in 2028-2029.
