## Investment case

**Bull:**
- +29% growth at $2.3B scale — rare for athletic brands
- ~60% gross margin (premium positioning)
- Federer partnership = brand credibility
- Nike's weakness creates structural opportunity
- [[Asia]]/apparel = large addressable expansion
- DTC shift driving margin improvement

**Bear:**
- ~50x forward PE — priced for perfection
- Growth must sustain 20%+ to justify valuation
- Almost entirely shoes (no diversification)
- Running shoe cycles are fickle (Hoka also surged then cooled)
- Nike turnaround under Elliott Hill could compress share
- [[Swiss franc]] headwinds for non-CHF revenue
- No proven cultural/lifestyle crossover yet (running-only)
