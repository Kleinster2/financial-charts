## What Moveworks does

Moveworks builds AI assistants that autonomously resolve employee requests across IT, HR, finance, and other enterprise functions. The platform combines:

- **AI Assistant** — Conversational interface for employee requests
- **Enterprise Search** — Unified search across company knowledge
- **Reasoning Engine** — Agentic AI that can take multi-step actions

Unlike chatbots that just answer questions, Moveworks agents can actually complete tasks — reset passwords, provision software, update records, route approvals.

## ServiceNow acquisition

**Deal terms:**
- Price: $2.85B (cash + stock)
- Announced: March 10, 2025
- Closed: December 15, 2025
- Largest acquisition in [[ServiceNow]] history

**Regulatory review:**
US antitrust officials issued a "second request" in July 2025, delaying close. CFO Mastantuono characterized it as "a timing issue" — deal ultimately cleared.

**Strategic rationale:**
- Combines ServiceNow's workflow automation with Moveworks' user-facing AI
- Accelerates [[ServiceNow]]'s [[Agentic AI]] strategy
- Adds 500 AI engineers and enterprise search capabilities
- Expected to add 100 bps to subscription revenue growth

---

## Why it matters

Moveworks represents the front-end of enterprise AI — the conversational layer employees interact with. [[ServiceNow]] has the back-end (workflows, data, integrations). Combined, they create end-to-end [[AI agents]] that can understand requests AND execute them.

This is the [[Agentic AI]] vision: AI that doesn't just assist but autonomously completes work.
