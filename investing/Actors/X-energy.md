## Why X-energy matters

X-energy is targeting industrial heat, not just electricity:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Design | Xe-100 (HTGR) |
| Output | 80 MW electric per unit |
| Unique angle | Industrial process heat |
| Key partner | Dow Chemical |
| DOE funding | ARDP recipient |

---

## Xe-100 design

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Type | High-temperature gas reactor |
| Coolant | Helium |
| Fuel | TRISO particles |
| Temperature | 750°C+ |
| Modularity | 80 MW units, scalable |

**Industrial heat advantage**: 750°C output can directly power chemical processes, not just generate electricity. Opens new market.

## Dow Chemical partnership

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Partner | Dow Chemical |
| Site | Texas Gulf Coast |
| Use case | Industrial heat + power |
| Units | Multiple Xe-100s |
| Timeline | 2030s |

First SMR deployment for industrial process heat in US.

---

## DOE support

| Program | Details |
|---------|---------|
| ARDP | Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program |
| Funding | $1.2B+ |
| Purpose | First Xe-100 demonstration |

One of two DOE-backed demonstration projects (other is [[TerraPower]]).

## TRISO fuel

X-energy also manufactures TRISO fuel:
- Tiny uranium kernels in ceramic shells
- "Meltdown-proof" design
- Used in Xe-100 and other advanced reactors
- Vertical integration advantage

---

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Industrial heat = new market
- Dow partnership validates
- DOE backing
- TRISO fuel vertical integration

**Bear:**
- Private (can't invest directly)
- Industrial timeline longer
- First-of-kind risk
- HALEU still needed
