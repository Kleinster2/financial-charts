## Copper growth strategy (CMD Dec 2025)

| Timeline | Copper target |
|----------|--------------|
| 2025 (actual) | ~852kt |
| 2026 | 810–870kt (cut from 930kt, Collahuasi issues) |
| 2028 | >1,000kt |
| 2035 | ~1,600kt |

**Growth rate:** 9.4% CAGR on copper 2026–2029. 4% overall copper-equivalent CAGR.

**Key growth levers:**
- Alumbrera restart (Argentina) — Q4 2026, production H1 2028
- Collahuasi expansion
- DRC copper expansion
- Argentine RIGI applications for incentives

---

## Coal strategy

Glencore kept coal (unlike peers who divested). Steelmaking coal production: 24.7Mt in 2025 including EVR assets from [[Teck Resources]]. Thermal coal guidance higher than consensus. Capex ~$6.5B/year for 2026–2028 (above Street expectations).

The bull case: coal cash flows fund copper growth. The bear case: ESG overhang suppresses multiple.

- Only mining + trading dual model — informational advantage
- 9.4% copper CAGR through 2029
- Coal cash flows fund copper growth transition
- Trading arm provides earnings stability
- $3.2B shareholder returns
- EVR acquisition adds steelmaking coal scale
- ~$1B cost savings being realized

**Bear:**
- $14.5B net debt is substantial
- Coal exposure = ESG discount
- 2026 copper guidance cut (Collahuasi)
- DRC operational/political risk
- Corruption history (2022 guilty plea, $1.5B penalties)
- Complexity discount for conglomerate structure
- Capex guidance above consensus

## ESG / Controversy

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| US/UK bribery plea | 2022, $1.5B in penalties |
| Coal exposure | Largest seaborne thermal coal producer |
| DRC operations | Artisanal mining, community relations |
| Cobalt supply chain | Child labour allegations (industry-wide) |
