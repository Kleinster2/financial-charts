## Key contributions

### Time consistency (1977)

Paper: "Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans" (with Prescott), *Journal of Political Economy*.

**Core insight:** Policymakers who cannot commit to rules in advance produce worse outcomes than those who can — even if they're trying to optimize at each moment.

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time inconsistency** | What's optimal today may not be optimal tomorrow |
| **Credibility problem** | Rational actors anticipate future temptations |
| **[[Inflation]] bias** | Central banks tempted to inflate after wages set |
| **Solution** | Rules, independence, reputation |

**Policy impact:** Directly influenced independent central banks, inflation targeting, and [[Fed independence]].

### Real Business Cycle theory (1982)

Paper: "Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations" (with Prescott), *Econometrica*.

**Core insight:** Business cycles can be driven by real (supply-side) shocks — technology, productivity — not just monetary/demand shocks.

See [[Real Business Cycle theory]] for full concept.
