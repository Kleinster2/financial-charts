**Ascend** — [[Huawei]]'s AI chip line. [[China]]'s leading domestic alternative to NVIDIA. Key to [[China]]'s AI self-sufficiency.

---

## Why Ascend matters

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [[China]] AI independence | Reduces NVIDIA dependence |
| Sanctions bypass | Domestically produced |
| Scale | Major Chinese cloud/AI adoption |
| Geopolitics | US-[[China]] tech competition |

---

## Product line

| Chip | Specs | [[Target]] |
|------|-------|--------|
| Ascend 910B | ~NVIDIA A100 class | Training |
| Ascend 910C | Next-gen (2024+) | Training |
| Ascend 310 | Inference focused | Edge/inference |

**Comparison:** Ascend 910B roughly comparable to A100, but 1-2 generations behind H100/H200.

---

## Ecosystem

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| CANN | Huawei's CUDA alternative |
| MindSpore | ML framework |
| Cloud | Huawei Cloud integration |
| Customers | [[Baidu]], [[Alibaba]], [[Tencent]] testing |

**Challenge:** CUDA ecosystem dominance hard to replicate.

---

## Production

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Fab | [[SMIC]] 7nm (sanctioned) |
| Yield | Lower than [[TSMC]] |
| Volume | Ramping but constrained |
| Packaging | Domestic ([[ASE]] alternatives) |

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (Huawei private, sanctioned), but:

- [[SMIC]] — fabs Ascend chips
- Chinese AI stocks — benefit from domestic chips
- [[NVIDIA]] — Ascend is the competition

---

## Limitations

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Performance gap | 1-2 gens behind NVIDIA |
| Software ecosystem | CANN vs CUDA |
| Yield/volume | SMIC constraints |
| Talent | Huawei under pressure |
