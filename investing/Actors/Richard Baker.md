**Real estate arbitrage thesis:**
- Department stores own valuable urban real estate
- Acquire stores below real estate value
- Monetize properties while operating retail

**The problem:** Retail operations deteriorated faster than real estate could be monetized.

**What went wrong:**
- [[Saks-Neiman merger]] loaded $5B debt
