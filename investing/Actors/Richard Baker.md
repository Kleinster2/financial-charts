## Strategy

**Real estate arbitrage thesis:**
- Department stores own valuable urban real estate
- Acquire stores below real estate value
- Monetize properties while operating retail

### The flagship bet

Baker's crown jewel: Saks Fifth Avenue flagship at 611 Fifth Ave.

| Year | Valuation | Event |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 2013 | — | Bought all of Saks for $2.9B |
| 2014 | **$3.7B** | Flagship alone worth more than acquisition |
| 2015 | — | JVs with Simon, RioCan valued portfolio at C$9.2B |
| 2019 | **$1.6B** | -57% collapse (retail apocalypse) |
| 2024 | **$3.6B** | Recovery (Neiman merger collateral) |

**Baker (2014):** "This valuation seems to indicate that it's the single most-valuable retail building in the world."

**Baker (2015):** "Our largest business is our real estate business. Everyone seems to have forgotten that I was a real estate guy, still am, and that HBC is primarily a real estate company. We own $7 billion worth of real estate."

### Real estate monetization attempts

| Year | Transaction | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 2014 | Saks flagship [[ground lease]] mortgage | $1.25B (20-year, interest-only) |
| 2015 | Simon Property JV | Properties valued at C$3.8B |
| 2015 | RioCan JV | $325M for 10 properties |
| 2024 | Flagship as Neiman merger collateral | — |
| 2026 | Flagship as [[DIP financing]] collateral | $1.75B bankruptcy financing |

### 2014 flagship mortgage (key detail)

Baker **originated** a new $1.25B mortgage in November 2014 — this was new debt, not an assumed existing mortgage:

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Amount | $1.25B |
| Collateral | **Ground + [[ground lease]] only** (NOT the building) |
| Term | 20-year, interest-only |
| Rate | Fixed, <4.40% |
| Lenders | BofA, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Nova Scotia |

**Use of proceeds:** Paid down $1.2B of HBC's floating-rate term loan (4.75%, maturing 2020). Essentially swapped expensive corporate debt for cheap real estate-secured debt.

**S&P noted:** "The Saks Fifth Avenue building is not collateral for the loan (only the land and the lease on the land secure the loan)."

**Strategic implication:** By collateralizing only the ground (not the building), Baker kept the [[611 Fifth Avenue]] building "clean" for future financing. This structure later enabled the $1.75B [[DIP financing]] in bankruptcy — the building could be pledged because it wasn't already encumbered.

**The problem:** Retail operations deteriorated faster than real estate could be monetized. The 2019 flagship collapse (-57%) showed valuations depend on operating performance, not just location.

## Saks Global collapse

**What went wrong:**
- [[Saks-Neiman merger]] loaded $5B debt
- Synergies didn't materialize
- Interest costs consumed cash flow
- Vendors stopped shipping
- [[Saks bankruptcy]] (Jan 2026)

**Replaced as CEO:** Jan 14, 2026 — Geoffroy van Raemdonck took over.

## Key events

- [[Saks-Neiman merger]] — 2024, the fatal deal
- [[Saks bankruptcy]] — Jan 2026, the collapse
