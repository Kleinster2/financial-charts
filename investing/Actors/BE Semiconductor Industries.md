Dutch semiconductor equipment company, global leader in die attach and the frontrunner in hybrid bonding — the next-gen packaging technology for HBM4 and advanced logic. [[Applied Materials]] took a 9% stake in April 2025, signaling strategic importance.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Ticker** | BESI.AS (Euronext Amsterdam) |
| **HQ** | Duiven, Netherlands |
| **CEO** | Richard Blickman (founder, since 1995) |
| **Revenue (2024)** | €607M |
| **Market Cap** | ~€9B |
| **Founded** | 1995 |

## What they make

| Segment | Share | Products |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Die Attach** | ~82% | Flip chip, TC bonders, hybrid bonders |
| **Packaging** | ~12% | Molding, trim & form |
| **Plating** | ~6% | Bumping, plating equipment |

**Market position:**
- **42% global share** in die attach equipment (market leader)
- **~75% share** in advanced die attach
- Leading hybrid bonding technology (100nm accuracy, Gen 2: 50nm)

## The hybrid bonding opportunity

Hybrid bonding directly fuses copper pads between dies without solder bumps — enabling tighter pitch, lower power, better thermal performance. Critical for:
- **HBM4/4E** — 16-layer memory stacks
- **Advanced logic** — chiplet integration

### BESI's position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **2023 hybrid bonding revenue** | €36M |
| **2026E hybrid bonding revenue** | €476M |
| **Target market share** | 30%+ |
| **Total market 2028E** | $2B+ |

At 2025 Investor Day, BESI elevated hybrid bonding to a core business pillar with targets of €1.5-1.9B revenue and 40-55% operating margins long-term.

### Technology lead

- **Gen 1**: 100nm placement accuracy (shipping)
- **Gen 2**: 50nm accuracy, <4μm bump pitch (launching)
- Competitors ([[Hanmi Semiconductor]], [[ASMPT]]) are 1-2 years behind

## Competitive dynamics

BESI is taking share from Korean TC bonder makers:

| Customer | Situation |
|----------|-----------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | Onboarding BESI/ASMPT, reducing [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] share to 20-30% by 2026 |
| [[Micron]] | Expected to use BESI exclusively for HBM4 |
| Major foundries | Follow-on orders for hybrid bonders in Q1-Q2 2025 |

Q4 2025 orders surged **105% YoY** to €250M, with hybrid bonding highlighted.

## History

- **1993**: Management buyout from ASM
- **1995**: Founded by Richard Blickman; IPO on Euronext Amsterdam 7 months later
- **1999**: Acquired Datacon (Austrian die bonding)
- **2000**: Acquired Meco (Dutch plating equipment)
- **2022**: Announced entry into hybrid bonding
- **Apr 2025**: [[Applied Materials]] acquired ~9% stake — signaling co-development potential

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2021 | €749M | €282M | Peak cycle (chip shortage) |
| 2022 | €723M | €241M | Still strong |
| 2023 | €579M | €177M | Cyclical trough |
| 2024 | €607M | €182M | Recovery beginning |
| 2025 Q1-Q3 | €425M | €89M | Hybrid bonding ramping |

Target: €1.5-1.9B revenue long-term with hybrid bonding at ~1/3 of mix.

## Price chart

![[besi-price-chart.png]]
*BESI (blue) +500% vs [[Applied Materials]] (red) +380% since 2020. Both benefited from semiconductor capex boom; BESI's hybrid bonding optionality drove premium. AMAT's 9% stake (Apr 2025) validates technology.*

## Fundamentals

![[besi-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked at ~€225M/quarter in 2021 chip shortage, declined to €130-160M range through 2023-2025 as cycle normalized. Hybrid bonding revenue (€36M in 2023 → €476M by 2026E) not yet visible in topline but is the growth driver.*

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:** Hybrid bonding is the future of advanced packaging; BESI's technology lead translates to 30%+ share of a $5B+ market; AMAT partnership accelerates roadmap.

**Bear case:** HBM4 delays hybrid bonding adoption (JEDEC allowed microbumps); Korean competitors catch up; cyclical downturn compresses multiples before hybrid bonding revenue materializes.

## Risks

- **Timing**: HBM4 stuck with microbumps; hybrid bonding pushed to HBM4E/5
- **Competition**: [[Hanmi Semiconductor]], [[ASMPT]], [[Applied Materials]] all investing heavily
- **Cyclicality**: Semiconductor equipment spending is volatile
- **Customer concentration**: Memory makers drive hybrid bonding demand
