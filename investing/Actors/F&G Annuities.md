## Blackstone sidecar (Aug 2025)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Announced | August 6, 2025 |
| Effective | August 1, 2025 |
| Capital | ~$1B anticipated commitments |
| Structure | Forward flow reinsurance, quota share on FIA |
| Asset manager | Blackstone |
| Purpose | Capital-light, fee-based model |

**Strategic shift:** Transforms F&G from spread-based annuity provider into fee-generating platform. Reduces capital intensity while maintaining earnings growth. Expected to improve ROE over time.

This is [[Blackstone]]'s entry into the PE-insurance sidecar model pioneered by [[Athene]]/[[Apollo]].

## Competitive positioning

F&G is smaller than peers but differentiated by:
1. **Public listing** — only publicly traded PE-linked annuity platform
2. **Capital-light pivot** — sidecar reduces balance sheet usage
3. **FNF backing** — title insurance giant provides distribution and capital
4. **Blackstone asset management** — marquee brand for institutional credibility

| [[Athene]] | [[Apollo]] | $430B | Fully integrated (merged) |
| [[Global Atlantic]] | [[KKR]] | >$200B | Wholly owned subsidiary |
| [[American Equity]] | [[Brookfield]] | $130B | Acquired ($4.3B) |
| [[Fortitude Re]] | [[Carlyle Group]] | $106B | Partial ownership + advisory |
