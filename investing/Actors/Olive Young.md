## Business model

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Curation** | Discovers emerging K-beauty brands |
| **Data** | 20+ years of consumer insights |
| **Private label** | House brands alongside third-party |

Think Sephora/Ulta but K-beauty focused. Became the launchpad for brands that later go global.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Store density | Ubiquitous in Korean cities |
| Brand relationships | First access to emerging K-beauty |
| Consumer trust | 25 years of curation credibility |
| Price point | Accessible vs prestige positioning |
