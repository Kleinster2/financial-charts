## Business model

Secured long-term operating rights via Master Lease Agreements (MLAs) — owner keeps asset, LuxUrban operates and takes cash flows. Focused on NYC properties.

The model required constant deal flow to maintain growth narrative. When deals dried up, management fabricated them.

## The Royalton fraud

**Nov 2023**: Announced 25-year master lease with the Royalton Hotel, a prestigious NYC property. Stock pumped on the news.

**Jan 17, 2024**: Short seller [[Bleecker Street Research]] published "The Bed Sheets Should Be Made Out Of Red Flags" — revealed the Royalton's owner confirmed no lease was ever signed and no letter of credit was provided. Stock dropped 22% over two days.

**Feb 2, 2024**: LuxUrban withdrew all Royalton statements. Admitted the deal never existed.

## What else emerged

- Landlords at four properties suing for unpaid rent
- Reported unit counts were overstated
- Securities fraud class action filed — court denied company's motion to dismiss
- $9.7M litigation reserve booked in Q3 2024

## Lessons

- Short sellers remain the primary fraud detection mechanism in small caps
- No financing + no plan at Chapter 11 = straight to liquidation
- When hotels close without warning guests, it's already over
