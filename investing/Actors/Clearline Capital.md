## Founding and Talpion relationship

[[Marc Majzner]] worked as a Senior Portfolio Manager at [[Talpion Fund Management]] from 2010 to 2011 after joining from [[North Run Capital]]. In 2012, [[Henry Swieca]] seeded Clearline Capital — described as a "Swieca Seedling" — with $50M from Talpion and an additional $20M from the Swieca family, totaling $70M in seed capital.

The arrangement included:
- Infrastructure sharing — Clearline operated from Talpion's offices at 950 Third Avenue, Floor 23, New York (the same address as Talpion's headquarters)
- Profit share — [[Talpion Fund Management|Talpion]] receives a share of Clearline's profits (specific terms not publicly disclosed)
- Fundraising support — Talpion assisted Clearline in raising external capital, potentially from Talpion's former investor base
- Hannah Swieca — a member of the [[Henry Swieca|Swieca]] family, serves as Investor Relations at Clearline (since Jul 2019) and also works as an Investment Professional at [[Talpion Fund Management|Talpion]] (since Dec 2022)

Swieca has said he got the seeding model from [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], who runs a similar structure from his family office.

As of ~2025, Clearline has moved to 750 Lexington Avenue, 25th Floor — part of a wave of ~50,000 sq ft of new leases at that building announced in Feb 2025.

## Strategy

Clearline describes its approach as catalyst-driven, value-oriented:

1. Catalyst identification — seeks securities where the issuer is or will soon undergo change driven by a particular event
2. Valuation gap — targets situations where trading value materially differs from fundamental value
3. Fundamental research — rigorous scenario analysis informed by a macroeconomic view
4. Long/short — takes both long and short positions, primarily in equity and fixed income securities
5. Mid-cap focus — specializes in mid-cap stocks
6. Absolute return orientation — aims for high absolute rates of return while minimizing capital loss risk

This is an event-driven strategy in the classic sense — not activist (no 13D filings found), but rather identifying corporate events (M&A, restructurings, spin-offs, management changes, regulatory catalysts) that create mispricings, then taking concentrated positions. The fund files 13G (passive) rather than 13D (activist) beneficial ownership reports.

## Performance

| Year | Return | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2012 | 26%+ net | First year; partial year from launch |
| Cumulative (all-time) | ~181% | WhaleWisdom backtester estimate based on 13F longs |
| 5-year annualized | ~14.3% | WhaleWisdom estimate based on 13F longs |

Note: The 2012 return of 26%+ net is sourced from the [[Henry Swieca]] note and contemporaneous reporting. WhaleWisdom performance estimates are based on disclosed 13F long positions only and do not capture shorts, fixed income, or non-13F positions, so they understate actual fund performance complexity. Actual fund returns are not publicly disclosed.

## AUM growth

| Period | Approximate AUM | Source |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 2012 (launch) | $70M | Seed capital |
| ~2017–2018 | ~$554M | PrivateFundData snapshot |
| ~2019 | ~$716M | Wallmine / SEC filing reference |
| May 2025 | $1,194M | Form ADV (discretionary) |
| Q3 2025 | $2,179M | 13F securities value |

The gap between discretionary AUM ($1.19B) and 13F value ($2.18B) likely reflects leverage, gross vs net exposure, and/or the inclusion of non-discretionary positions in the 13F.

## Fund structure

The firm manages 3 pooled investment vehicles:

| Entity | AUM | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Clearline Capital Partners LP | $967M | Domestic feeder |

## Marc Majzner — career detail

| Period | Role | Firm |
|--------|------|------|
| ~1999–2000 | Engineer | [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], MSN ([[Microsoft]]) |
| 2000 | BS + MS Computer Science | [[Brown University]] |
| ~2000–2002 | Investment Banking Analyst | [[Credit Suisse]] |
| 2002–2007 | Senior Associate | [[Spectrum Equity]] (growth PE, Boston; $11B raised across 10 funds since 1994) |
| ~2007–2010 | Investment Analyst | [[North Run Capital]] (value + catalyst hedge fund, Boston; founded 2003 by Todd Hammer and Thomas Ellis; ~$2.2B AUM) |
| 2010–2011 | Senior Portfolio Manager | [[Talpion Fund Management]] |
| 2012–present | Founder, Portfolio Manager | Clearline Capital |

The [[North Run Capital]] connection is notable — North Run employs a "value-plus-catalyst" strategy with intensive fundamental research and a "private equity methodology" for valuation, which closely mirrors Clearline's stated approach. Majzner appears to have brought this framework from North Run to Talpion to Clearline.

## Portfolio characteristics (Q3 2025)

Based on 13F filing dated Nov 14, 2025 (reporting period Sep 30, 2025):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total 13F value | $2,179M |
| Total positions | 137 securities |
| Long equity positions | 107 |
| Top 10 concentration | 60.56% |
| Quarterly turnover | 41.6% |
| Largest holding | SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) — 46.8% of portfolio |

### Top holdings (Q3 2025)

| # | Ticker | Company | % of portfolio |
|---|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | SPY | SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust | 46.8% |
| 2 | GTLS | [[Chart Industries]] | 2.3% |
| 3 | LBTYA | [[Liberty Global]] Class A | 1.6% |
| 4 | MU | [[Micron Technology]] | 1.6% |
| 5 | FLS | [[Flowserve]] | 1.6% |
| 6 | SMTC | [[Semtech]] | ~5.7% (estimated from $124M position) |
| 7 | VYX | [[NCR Voyix]] | top 5 |

The massive SPY position (~46.8%) likely serves as a market hedge against concentrated single-stock longs. Excluding SPY, the portfolio is concentrated in mid-cap industrials, semiconductors, and technology — consistent with the stated catalyst-value approach.

### Notable position changes (recent quarters)

- [[Semtech]] (SMTC) — increased 9,102% in Q1 2025 to 2.75M shares ($124M); one of the most aggressive builds in the portfolio
- [[Chart Industries]] (GTLS) — increased position
- [[Core Scientific]] (CORZ) — new position ([[Bitcoin]] mining)
- [[Nebius]] Group (NBIS) — new position
- Cipher Mining (CIFR) — new position
- Reduced: [[NVIDIA]], [[MongoDB]], [[Adobe]]

### PIPE activity

- [[Heron Therapeutics]] (HRTX) — participated in $30M PIPE (Jul 25, 2023) alongside Rubric Capital Management and Velan Capital; 20.7M shares at $1.37/share. Subsequently reduced position in 2024–2025.
