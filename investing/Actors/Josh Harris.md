## Investment significance

Harris demonstrates the trend of financial moguls converting PE wealth into sports empires — similar to [[Steve Cohen]] (Mets), David Tepper (Panthers), and Robert Kraft (Patriots). Sports teams are now alternative assets: trophy properties with media rights upside, real estate development optionality, and inflation protection.
