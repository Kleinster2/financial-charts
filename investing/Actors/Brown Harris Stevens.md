## Investment case

Bull:
- 150+ year brand in NYC luxury — deep relationships and institutional knowledge
- Highest average sales price per agent in the US — quality over quantity
- Private ownership = long-term thinking, no quarterly pressure
- Property management division (400+ buildings, 30K units) provides recurring revenue
- Halstead merger doubled scale without dilution
- Independent positioning as Compass consolidates — some agents/clients prefer independence

Bear:
- Revenue not disclosed — limited transparency
- NYC luxury real estate is cyclical and rate-sensitive
- Compass mega-merger creates scale disadvantage in technology and marketing spend
- Agent retention risk — top agents courted by competitors with sign-on packages
- Private ownership limits growth capital vs public/PE-backed peers
- Geographic concentration on East Coast luxury
