**Japan Semiconductor Revival** — $50B+ government investment. Rapidus, TSMC fabs. National strategy.

---

## Why Japan matters

Semiconductor comeback:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Government investment | $50B+ planned |
| Key project | [[Rapidus]] |
| TSMC fab | Kumamoto |
| Goal | Regain semiconductor leadership |

---

## Historical context

**Rise and fall:**

| Era | Japan share |
|-----|-------------|
| 1980s | 50%+ global |
| 1990s | Decline began |
| 2020 | ~10% |
| 2030 target | Revival |

Lost leadership to [[Taiwan]]/Korea.

---

## Rapidus

**2nm moonshot:**
- Joint venture ([[Toyota]], [[Sony]], etc.)
- [[IBM]] partnership for 2nm
- Government subsidies
- Hokkaido fab
- 2027 production target

---

## TSMC Kumamoto

**TSMC Japan fab:**
- $8.6B investment
- 12/16/22/28nm initially
- [[Sony]] + Denso partners
- [[Automotive]] + industrial
- Second fab announced

---

## Government subsidies

| Project | Subsidy |
|---------|---------|
| Rapidus | $13B+ |
| TSMC Kumamoto | $4B+ |
| [[Micron]] Hiroshima | $1.8B |
| Various | Ongoing |

Massive state support.

---

## Strategic rationale

**Why Japan is investing:**
- National security
- [[Taiwan]] risk (TSMC dependence)
- [[Automotive]] supply chain
- AI compute sovereignty
- Economic revival

---

## Key players

| Company | Role |
|---------|------|
| [[Rapidus]] | Leading edge (2nm) |
| [[TSMC]] | Mature nodes fab |
| [[Sony]] | Investor, customer |
| [[Toyota]] | Investor, automotive |
| [[Tokyo Electron]] | Equipment |

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Risk |
|-----------|------|
| Talent shortage | Engineers lacking |
| Rapidus timeline | Very aggressive |
| Cost overruns | Likely |
| Competition | TSMC/Samsung ahead |

Ambitious but unproven.

---

## Investment implications

**Japan revival = tailwinds for:**
- Tokyo Electron (equipment)
- Screen Holdings (equipment)
- Japanese materials companies
- Construction/infrastructure

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Government spend | $50B+ |
| Key project | Rapidus |
| TSMC fab | Kumamoto |
| [[Target]] | 2nm by 2027 |
