## Business model

Four-pillar ecosystem, pivoting from pure iBuying:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash Offer** | Traditional iBuying |
| **HomePro** | Agent-assisted (asset-light) |
| **Renovate** | B2B renovation services |
| **Direct+** | Institutional buyer channel |

**May 2025 shift:** Now requires seller meetings with HomePro agents before cash offers — pushes toward lower-capital model.

## Why it matters

**Test case for iBuying survival.** If Offerpad dies, proves iBuying only works at massive scale (Opendoor) or not at all.

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Extreme distressed valuation (0.09x P/S)
- Meme stock potential for squeeze
- HomePro pivot reduces capital needs
- If housing recovers, operating leverage

**Bear case:**
- Near-death financial position
- Continued dilution
- iBuying model may be broken
- Much smaller than Opendoor scale
- Could go to zero

**Not investable for most.** Speculative lottery ticket at best.
