## Product

### What Adept built

AI agent that uses software like a human:
- Controls mouse and keyboard
- Navigates web browsers
- Uses enterprise software ([[Salesforce]], etc.)
- Natural language commands → actions

**Vision:** "ACT-1" model to automate knowledge work.

### Why it mattered

Early mover in [[Agentic AI]] — before the 2024-2025 agent boom. Proved the concept but struggled with go-to-market.

## Amazon deal (June 2024)

### Structure

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Acqui-hire (not acquisition) |
| Tech | Amazon licensed Adept's models/data |
| Team | Most executives joined Amazon |
| Payment to Adept | ~$25M |
| Investor outcome | Roughly broke even |

**Why not acquisition:** Amazon avoided regulatory scrutiny by structuring as hiring + licensing. Similar to [[Microsoft]]/Inflection deal.

### FTC scrutiny

FTC sent questions to Amazon about the deal — part of broader probe into Big Tech AI talent acquisitions (also looking at [[Microsoft]]/Inflection).

## Amazon AGI SF Lab (Dec 2024)

Post-deal, Amazon formed new lab led by [[David Luan]]:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Name | Amazon AGI SF Lab |
| Leader | [[David Luan]] |
| Reports to | Rohit Prasad (Amazon AGI head) |
| Focus | [[AI agents]] for digital + physical worlds |
| Capabilities | Computer use, web browsing, code execution |

Adept's vision now lives inside Amazon.

## Lessons

### Why Adept sold

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Burn rate** | $415M raised, needed more |
| **Competition** | OpenAI, [[Anthropic]], [[Google]] all building agents |
| **Go-to-market** | Research-first, enterprise sales lagged |
| **Runway** | Couldn't raise at higher valuation |

### Pattern

Adept joins Inflection (→ [[Microsoft]]), Character.ai (→ [[Google]]) as elite AI startups absorbed by Big Tech via acqui-hire structures that avoid M&A scrutiny.
