## Why EDF matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | State-owned (France) |
| Nuclear fleet | 56 reactors |
| France electricity | ~70% nuclear |
| AI strategy | 2 GW data center sites |

---

## AI data center initiative

**Strategy pivot:** From using AI → powering AI

**Sites program:**
- 4 industrial sites identified (EDF land)
- Total available power: **2 GW**
- 2 additional sites by 2026
- Target: 1 GW computing power by 2028

**Value proposition:**
- Low-carbon nuclear electricity
- Competitive pricing (€70/MWh ceiling from 2026)
- Grid-connected land reduces project time by years
