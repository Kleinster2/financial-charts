## Technology

**Why photonics?**

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Scalability | Uses existing semiconductor fabs |
| Room temperature | Qubits don't need extreme cooling |
| Low error rates | Photons don't interact with environment |
| Manufacturing | Partners with [[GlobalFoundries]] |

**Omega chipset (Feb 2025):**
- Single-photon sources
- Superconducting single-photon detectors
- Barium Titanate (BTO) optical switches
- Manufactured at [[GlobalFoundries]] Fab 8 (Malta, NY)

## Roadmap

| Milestone | [[Target]] |
|-----------|--------|
| Omega chipset | Feb 2025 ✓ |
| IQMP groundbreaking | Sep 2025 ✓ |
| Brisbane facility | 2026-2027 |
| IQMP construction | 2026-2028 |
| Commercial system | **2029** |

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | vs PsiQuantum |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| [[IBM]] | Superconducting | Different physics |
| [[Google]] | Superconducting | Different physics |
| IonQ | Trapped ion | Different physics |
| QuEra | Neutral atom | Different physics |
| [[Quantinuum]] | Trapped ion | Different physics |

**PsiQuantum bet:** Only photonics can scale to million qubits using existing semiconductor infrastructure.

## Applications (target)

| Domain | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| Drug discovery | Molecular simulation |
| [[Materials science]] | Battery, catalyst design |
| Climate | Carbon capture optimization |
| Finance | Portfolio optimization |

## Investment implications

**Private company** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[GlobalFoundries]] (GFS) — manufacturing partner
- [[NVIDIA]] — investor (NVentures)
- [[BlackRock]] — lead investor

**Watch for:**
- Brisbane facility progress
- Additional government deals
- IPO (likely post-2029 commercial milestone)
