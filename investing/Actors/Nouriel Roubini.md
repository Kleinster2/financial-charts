| **Populism** | Rising globally |
| **Geopolitical fracture** | US-[[China]], [[Russia]]-West divides |

## Current views (2025-2026)

**Plot twist: Dr. Doom turned bullish on US**

### The bull case

| View | Roubini position |
|------|------------------|
| US economy | "Best positioned among advanced economies" |
| AI bubble | **No** — productivity gains real |
| US potential growth | 1.8% today → **4% by 2030** |
| American exceptionalism | Gets even stronger with higher growth |
| AGI timeline | 3-5 years away; could **5x valuations** of winners |
| Mag 7 winners | "Maybe three or four" will achieve AGI — not all seven |

### 15 technologies, not just AI

> "Everybody is talking about AI, GenAI, but this is only one of the 15 technologies of the future"

- [[Semiconductors]]
- Biomedical research
- [[Quantum computing]]
- Fusion energy
- [[Defense]] tech
- New materials science

### [[Productivity]] revolution in the data

| Period | [[Productivity]] growth |
|--------|---------------------|
| 2009-2019 (post-GFC) | **1.0%** average |
| Since 2019 | **~2.0%** (doubled) |
| 2024 | **2.4%** |
| Q3 2024 | **~5%** |

**S&P 500 real revenue per worker:** +15% since [[ChatGPT]] launch (Nov 2022) — ~5%/year

**By sector:**
- Tech & communications: ~20%
- Broad-based across sectors

### "Tech trumps tariffs"

| Factor | Impact on potential growth |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Technology upside | **+200bp** |
| Bad policies downside | **-50bp** |
| **Ratio** | **4:1** |

"Bad stagflationary policies of Trump" = trade restrictions, migration limits, fiscal deficit, [[Fed independence]] threats, rule of law concerns

**Net:** Tech benefits overwhelm policy drag.

### Who captures the gains?

> "Most of those productivity gains are gotten by the firms. Real wages are growing less than productivity. Labor costs are falling."

| Stakeholder | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| Corporations | Profitability up |
| Workers | Real wages lag productivity |
| Consumers | Affordability concerns |

**Implication:** Long equities, not labor income.

### On geopolitical risks

| Risk | Market impact |
|------|---------------|
| Israel-[[Iran]] (June 2025) | "12-day war" — oil wobbled, then normalized |
| [[Venezuela]] | "Less than 2M bbl/day" — macro impact ~zero |
| [[Russia]]-Ukraine | Mess, but not 2022 shock repeat |
| US-[[China]] | Competitive, not zero-sum |

> "Every time there is a geopolitical risk, people say stuff could happen. But so far... not a market effect."

### On [[Fed independence]] (Jan 2026)

Markets "shrugged off" DOJ-Powell news because tech thesis dominates.

---

**Key shift:** Bearish on structural risks (debt, geopolitics) but bullish on US relative performance. Technology is first-order; everything else is second-order.

## Views on AI

| Aspect | View |
|--------|------|
| [[Productivity]] | Real benefits for cost-cutting, revenue, profitability |
| Jobs | "Cost-cutting means what? Eliminating jobs." |
| Inequality | Makes it worse — "capital intensive, high-skill bias, labor saving" |
| Bubble | Does not see AI as bubble — productivity gains support valuations |

---

## Views on crypto

**Harsh critic:**

> "All this talk of decentralization is just bullsh*t."

Dismisses Bitcoin and crypto as speculative, not transformative.

---

## Track record

| Call | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **2006: [[Housing]] crash** | ✓ Correct — made his reputation |
| **2010s: Double-dip recession** | ✗ Wrong — recovery continued |
| **2020: COVID worse than 2008** | Partially — severe but shorter |
| **2022: Stagflation coming** | Mixed — inflation spiked, no recession |
| **2024: US exceptionalism** | TBD — bullish turn |

**Pattern:** Famous for one spectacular call, but persistent bearishness led to missed rallies.
