## Competitive position

**US market:** Effective monopoly. DTCC settles the vast majority of US securities transactions.

**Global comparison:**

| Infrastructure | Region | AUC |
|----------------|--------|-----|
| **DTCC/DTC** | US | $100.3T |
| [[Euroclear]] | Europe | EUR 42.5T (~$46T) |
| [[Clearstream]] | Europe | ~$15T |

DTCC, Euroclear, and Clearstream collaborate on digital asset frameworks but dominate their respective regions with no meaningful competition.

## T+1 Settlement (May 2024)

Successfully transitioned US markets from T+2 to T+1:
- CNS fail rate: 2.12% (consistent with T+2 levels)
- DTC non-CNS fail rate: 3.31%
- Led by DTCC with [[SIFMA]] and ICI

- SEC no-action letter approved 3-year pilot
- Partnering with Digital Asset on Canton Network
- MVP targeting H1 2026
- Eligible: Russell 1000, Treasuries, major ETFs

## GameStop controversy (Jan 2021)

- DTCC raised collateral requirements to 100% of trade value
- [[Robinhood]] faced $3B margin call, couldn't meet it
- Result: Trading restrictions on GME, AMC
- DTCC waived $9.7B in collateral requirements (per House committee)
- Criticism: Lacked clear policies on waiver decisions
- Outcome: Accelerated push to T+1 settlement

## Regulatory oversight

| Regulator | Role |
|-----------|------|
| [[SEC]] | Primary regulator (DTC, NSCC, FICC) |
| [[Federal Reserve]] | Supervisory role, SIFMU oversight |
| [[CFTC]] | Derivatives oversight |
| FSOC | SIFMU designation |

---

## Risks

**Systemic concentration:**
- Single point of failure for US securities settlement
- Margin calls can drain liquidity system-wide
- "Too big to fail" infrastructure

**Counterparty risk:**
- If major participant defaults, DTCC must absorb losses
- Clearing fund sized for "Cover 2" (two largest defaults)
