## Competitive landscape

| Product | Company | Position |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Cursor** | Anysphere | Leader, $1B ARR |
| GitHub Copilot | [[Microsoft]] | Incumbent, market share eroding |
| Windsurf | [[Cognition]] (acquired) | Integrated with Devin |
| Devin | [[Cognition]] | AI agent, different approach |

---

## OpenAI acquisition attempt

**Deal failed (2025):**
- OpenAI approached Anysphere
- Acquisition discussions
- Failed to gain traction
- Anysphere stayed independent

Signal: Cursor valuable enough for OpenAI interest.

---

## Semiconductor relevance

**Indirect but significant:**
- Cursor uses cloud AI (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI)
- More AI coding = more inference demand
- Developer productivity = more software = more compute

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Fastest growth ever
- Eating Copilot share
- Developer love
- Massive TAM (all developers)
- AI coding inevitable

**Bear:**
- $29.3B valuation = priced for perfection
- Microsoft can iterate Copilot
- Commoditization risk
- Model providers could compete
