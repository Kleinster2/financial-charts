## Acquisitions

| Date | Target | Deal Value | Strategic Rationale |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Nov 2024 | Supermaven | — | AI coding assistant |
| Jul 2025 | Koala (talent) | — | Enterprise talent acqui-hire |
| Dec 2025 | Graphite | >"$290M" | Code review, stacked PRs |

**Graphite (Dec 2025):**
- Code review startup, $52M Series B at $290M valuation earlier in 2025
- Customers: Shopify, Snowflake, Figma, Perplexity (500+ companies)
- Key feature: "stacked pull requests" — work on dependent changes without waiting for approvals
- Will operate independently, integrate over 2026
- Fills gap: Cursor accelerated code writing, but review process unchanged

## Competitive landscape

| Product | Company | Position |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Cursor** | Anysphere | Leader, $1B ARR |
| GitHub Copilot | [[Microsoft]] | Incumbent, market share eroding |
| Windsurf | [[Cognition]] (acquired) | Integrated with Devin |
| Devin | [[Cognition]] | AI agent, different approach |

---

## OpenAI acquisition attempt

**Deal failed (2025):**
- OpenAI approached Anysphere
- Acquisition discussions
- Failed to gain traction
- Anysphere stayed independent

Signal: Cursor valuable enough for OpenAI interest.

---

## Semiconductor relevance

**Indirect but significant:**
- Cursor uses cloud AI (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI)
- More AI coding = more inference demand
- Developer productivity = more software = more compute

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Fastest growth ever
- Eating Copilot share
- Developer love
- Massive TAM (all developers)
- AI coding inevitable

**Bear:**
- $29.3B valuation = priced for perfection
- Microsoft can iterate Copilot
- Commoditization risk
- Model providers could compete
