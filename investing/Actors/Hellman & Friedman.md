## Why Hellman & Friedman matters

**Elite buyout firm.** One of the oldest and most respected PE firms. Avoids asset-heavy industrial businesses; focuses on software, services, and healthcare where operational improvements drive returns.

**Claritev cautionary tale.** H&F bought MultiPlan in 2016, then sold it to public markets via [[Michael Klein]]'s Churchill Capital III SPAC in October 2020. The $11B valuation (12.9x forward EBITDA) marked peak. [[Muddy Waters]] published a devastating short report one month later. Stock has since fallen ~90%. H&F remained the largest shareholder post-merger — a rare case where PE sellers didn't fully exit before collapse.

## Investment focus

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Software** | Enterprise applications |
| **Financial services** | Insurance, payments |
| **Healthcare services** | [[Claritev]], Medline |
| **Professional services** | Baker Tilly, Moss Adams |
| **Information services** | Data, analytics |

H&F explicitly avoids asset-intensive and industrial businesses.
