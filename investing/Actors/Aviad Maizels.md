## Track record

| Company | Outcome | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [[PrimeSense]] | Sold to Apple, 2013 | Became **Face ID** — defining iPhone feature |
| [[Q.ai]] | Sold to Apple, 2026 (~$2B) | Silent speech for Siri/wearables |

Two successful Apple acquisitions. PrimeSense technology shipped in hundreds of millions of iPhones. Q.ai could follow similar trajectory.

## Q.ai

Co-founded in 2022 with computer scientists Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya. Developed AI that interprets speech from facial micro-movements — enables non-verbal device control.

Grew to ~100 employees before acquisition.

## Apple relationship

Maizels has credibility few founders have: he built technology Apple shipped at massive scale. When he pitched Q.ai, Apple knew his execution capability. The $2B price reflects both the technology and the team.
