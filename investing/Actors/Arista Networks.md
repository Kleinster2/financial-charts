## Product portfolio

| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| EOS | Extensible Operating System — cloud-native, software-defined |
| 7800R3 | Spine switches |
| 7060X | Leaf switches |
| 7130 | Ultra-low latency |
| CloudVision | Network management |

## AI cluster architecture

**Spine-leaf topology:**
```
GPU Servers → Leaf Switches → Spine Switches
                    ↓
            All-to-all connectivity
```

Arista provides the switch fabric.

| Revenue | $2.49B | $1.93B | +28.9% |
| GAAP GM | 62.9% | 63.8% | -90bps |
| Non-GAAP GM | 63.4% | 64.2% | -80bps |
| GAAP net income | $955.8M | $801.0M | +19.3% |
| Non-GAAP net income | $1.047B | $849.6M | +23.2% |
| GAAP EPS | $0.75 | $0.62 | +21% |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $0.82 | $0.66 | +24% |

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2024 | YoY |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Revenue | $9.006B | $7.003B | +28.6% |
| GAAP net income | $3.511B | $2.852B | +23.1% |
| GAAP EPS | $2.75 | $2.23 | +23.3% |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $2.98 | $2.32 | +28.4% |

**Key highlights:**
- 150 million cumulative ports shipped milestone
- Acquired **VeloCloud SD-WAN** portfolio from [[Broadcom]]
- Launched R4 series platforms for AI/data center networking
- Arista AVA: agentic AI for network operations
- ESUN (Ethernet for Scale-Up Networks) initiative with OCP
- Todd Nightingale appointed President
- **Q1 2026 guidance: $2.6B revenue** — implies continued ~25%+ growth

**Margin compression note:** Non-GAAP GM ticked down from 65.2% (Q3) to 63.4% (Q4) — likely mix shift toward higher-bandwidth AI networking equipment (400G/800G), which carries lower margins but higher ASPs.
