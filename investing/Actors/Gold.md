**Gold** — Precious metal and monetary asset. Safe haven, inflation hedge, central bank reserve. At record highs (Jan 2026) driven by Fed independence concerns and central bank accumulation.

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price | $4,641/oz (record high Jan 14) |
| YTD return | +5% |
| 2025 return | +27% |
| 2024 return | +27% |

## Central bank accumulation

**Historic shift:** For first time since 1996, gold now accounts for larger share of central bank reserves than US Treasuries.

| 2022 | 1,082 tonnes | Post-sanctions surge |
| 2023 | 1,037 tonnes | Continued accumulation |
| 2024 | 1,000+ tonnes | Third consecutive year |
| 2025 | ~1,000 tonnes | Estimate |
| 2026E | ~755 tonnes | Forecast |

**Key buyers:**
- Poland — largest European buyer
- Turkey — diversifying from USD
- Uzbekistan — regional leader
- China — strategic reserves (under-reported)
- India — traditional demand

**Why they're buying:**
- De-dollarization post-Russia sanctions
- Geopolitical hedging
- Reserve diversification
- No counterparty risk

## Fed independence correlation

| Scenario | Gold response |
|----------|---------------|
| Fed independence threatened | Rally (safe haven) |
| Political pressure on rates | Rally (credibility concerns) |
| Dovish Fed chair appointed | Rally (inflation fears) |
| Fed credibility restored | Consolidation |

**Julius Baer (Jan 2026):**
> "We see increased interference with the Fed as a key bullish wildcard for the precious metals in 2026."

**El-Erian (Jan 2026):**
> "Price of gold indicates at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."
