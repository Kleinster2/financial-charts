**Kuvare** — Chicago-based insurance holding company. Acquired by [[Blue Owl]] in a **$750 million deal in 2024**, making it a captive insurance platform for Blue Owl's asset management business.

## Why it matters

Kuvare is central to the [[PE-insurance convergence]] model: Blue Owl manages assets, Kuvare provides permanent insurance capital to buy them. In the [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]], Kuvare was one of four buyers of the $1.4B loan portfolio — raising self-dealing questions since Blue Owl owns both the selling fund and the buying insurer. [[Barclays]] warned that some sold assets would likely flow into Blue Owl-managed [[CLO]]s purchased by Kuvare, adding **9-10x leverage** to assets previously held in 1x-levered BDCs.
