## Toto campaign (Feb 2026)

Took stake in [[Toto]] ~6 months before disclosure (Aug 2025). Top 20 shareholder. Thesis: advanced ceramics business (electrostatic chucks for [[3D NAND]]) is "the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary." Calling for disclosure, capital allocation reform, 55%+ upside.
