## Why it matters

The STAR Market is [[China]]'s primary venue for tech IPOs. Registration-based listing (less regulatory gatekeeping than main board), allows unprofitable companies, dual-class shares, and Red Chip structures. Designed to keep Chinese tech companies listing domestically rather than in [[Hong Kong]] or the US.

Target sectors: AI, semiconductors, new materials, new energy, biomedicine, high-end equipment. "New Generation IT" makes up ~35% of listings.
