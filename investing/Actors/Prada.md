## Real estate strategy

Prada bought rather than leased prime Fifth Avenue locations:

| Property | Location | Price | Year |
|----------|----------|-------|------|
| **720-724 Fifth Ave** | NYC | **$835M** | 2023-24 |

724 Fifth Ave was Prada's store since 1997 (previously leased). 720 Fifth Ave was Abercrombie & Fitch location.

**Thesis:** Own flagship real estate as strategic moat. See [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]].

## Versace acquisition

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced | April 2025 |
| Seller | Capri Holdings |
| Enterprise value | €1.25B |
| Status | Pending |

**Strategic rationale:** Add third major brand to portfolio, expand in Americas where Versace is stronger.

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Miu Miu momentum continues
- Outperforming peers in tough environment
- Strong balance sheet (€600M net cash)
- Versace adds scale
- Owned real estate appreciating

**Bear case:**
- Prada brand itself is flat/declining
- Miu Miu growth may normalize
- Versace turnaround uncertain
- Luxury slowdown in [[China]] affects all

**Vs. peers:**
- Prada +15% vs. [[Kering]] -12% in 2024
- Miu Miu cultural relevance vs. Gucci decline
