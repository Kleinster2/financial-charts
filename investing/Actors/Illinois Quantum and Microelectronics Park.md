## Strategic context

**Illinois's quantum bet:**
- Prior $200M investment in [[Chicago Quantum Exchange]] built ecosystem
- $500M IQMP seed is largest state quantum investment in US
- Attracted $280M federal funding for 4 National Quantum Initiative centers (most of any region)
- **The Bloch** — designated US Tech Hub for quantum (EDA)

**Location significance:**
- South Side Chicago economic development
- 12 miles from downtown
- Near world-class research universities
- Former steel site → quantum manufacturing (industrial transition narrative)

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — state-funded, university-managed infrastructure.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[PsiQuantum]] investors: [[BlackRock]], [[Temasek]], [[NVIDIA]] (NVentures)
- [[GlobalFoundries]] (GFS) — [[PsiQuantum]] manufacturing partner
- [[Infleqtion]] — going public via SPAC (INFQ), IQMP tenant
- [[IBM]] — partner
- Real estate: [[Related Midwest]]

**Watch for:**
- [[PsiQuantum]] progress toward million-qubit milestone
- Additional tenant announcements
- Federal funding (CHIPS Act, DARPA contracts)
- [[Infleqtion]] SPAC closing
