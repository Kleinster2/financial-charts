## Stakeholders / Consortium

| Stakeholder | Type | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| **Japanese Government** | Funding | ¥920B+ ($6B+) committed |
| **Toyota** | Founding member | Automotive demand |
| **Sony** | Founding member | Image sensors, PlayStation |
| **NTT** | Founding member | Telecom |
| **Denso** | Founding member | Automotive supplier |
| **[[Kioxia]]** | Founding member | NAND expertise |
| **SoftBank** | Founding member | Tech/telecom |
| **NEC** | Founding member | Enterprise IT |
| **MUFG Bank** | Founding member | Financing |
| **IBM** | Technology partner | 2nm GAA process license |

**Structure:** Consortium of 8 Japanese companies + government backing + IBM technology.

**Government commitment:** ¥920B (~$6B) — largest Japanese semiconductor investment since 1980s.

## Background

- **Founded**: 2022
- **Location**: Hokkaido, Japan
- **Goal**: Restore Japan's semiconductor manufacturing capability
- **Model**: Small batch production (different from TSMC/Samsung volume model)

---

## Strategy: Small batch model

Unlike traditional high-volume fabs (TSMC, Samsung), Rapidus is pursuing a **small batch** approach:

- Faster processing times for baking, cooling steps
- Heavy reliance on metrology and inspection
- May start with small volumes in 2027
- Designed to push Japan's equipment ecosystem forward

This is a different bet — not competing on volume, but on flexibility and ecosystem development.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Pilot line | 2025 |
| Small volume production | 2027 |
| Mass production | TBD |

Supplier sentiment at SEMICON Japan 2024: "high confidence" in 2027 timeline.

## Why it matters for this vault

- Another 2nm entrant alongside [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], [[Intel Foundry Services]]
- Different model (small batch) vs traditional high-volume
- Japan's "Lost 30 Years" potentially ending
- Could serve customers who want geographic diversification from Taiwan

---

## For theses

- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — neutral to bearish Korea; competes with Samsung for "TSMC alternative" positioning
- [[Long TSMC]] — if Rapidus fails, reinforces TSMC's moat durability

---

## Open questions

- Can small batch model scale to meaningful volumes?
- Will customers trust a new entrant for 2nm?
- Is IBM 2nm process competitive with TSMC/Samsung GAA?
- How does Japanese government support compare to [[CHIPS Act]]?

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private (consortium) |
| Government funding | ¥920B+ (~$6B+) |
| Private investment | ~¥7.3B from 8 founding companies |
| Target capex | ~$10B+ through 2027 |
| Revenue | $0 (pre-production) |
| Production target | 2027 (small batch) |

**Funding model:** Government-backed national champion. Japan's largest semiconductor investment since 1980s.
