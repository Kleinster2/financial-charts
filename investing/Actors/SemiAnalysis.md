## Why SemiAnalysis matters

**The go-to source for AI infrastructure intelligence:**

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Supply chain tracking | Satellite imagery of DC construction, shipping data, fab capacity |
| Leak verification | Published Google "No Moat" memo (May 2023), GPT-4 architecture details |
| Bottleneck identification | First to quantify CoWoS/HBM constraints as primary AI limiters |
| Supplier scoops | Broke Vicor losing H100, Credo losing AI socket |
| Cost analysis | Challenged DeepSeek's "$6M training" claim → actual $1.3B capex |

A veteran PM once said every buy-side shop would "drop everything to hire" Doug O'Laughlin.

## Notable reports & scoops

### Leaked documents

| Report | Date | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| **[Google "We Have No Moat"](https://semianalysis.com/2023/05/04/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither/)** | May 2023 | Internal Google doc arguing open-source would beat both Google and [[OpenAI]]. [[Demis Hassabis]] later confirmed authenticity. |
| **GPT-4 architecture leak** | Jul 2023 | Revealed 1.8T parameters, 120 layers, 16 MoE experts (~110B each), 13T training tokens, $63M training cost. "OpenAI keeps it closed because it's replicable." |

### Supply chain analysis

| Report | Key finding |
|--------|-------------|
| **[AI Capacity Constraints - CoWoS and HBM](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and)** | First to identify CoWoS packaging as primary AI bottleneck, not chip fab |
| **[Blackwell rework](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/nvidias-blackwell-reworked-shipment)** | Broke that Blackwell had packaging issues; B200A introduced with single monolithic die |
| **Vicor/Credo losses** | Exclusively detailed Vicor losing H100 power supply to MPS; Credo losing AI socket |
| **SK Hynix-Hanmi dispute** | Reported Hanmi pulling field service from SK Hynix fabs, threatening HBM supply |
| **[TPUv7 analysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the)** | Comprehensive TPU vs NVIDIA comparison showing TPUv7 reaching 94% of GB200 |

### DeepSeek cost analysis

Challenged the viral "$6M training cost" for DeepSeek V3:
- Actual GPU capex: **$1.3B** (not $6M)
- Infrastructure: 50K Hopper GPUs (10K H100, 10K H800, 30K H20, 10K A100)
- $6M only counted pre-training compute, ignored R&D, infra, other costs
