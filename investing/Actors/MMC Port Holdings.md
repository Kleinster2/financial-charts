**MMC Port Holdings** — Malaysia's largest port operator. 7 ports including Port of Tanjung Pelepas. RM4.36B revenue, RM761M net income (FY24). Controlled by billionaire Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary. Planned RM29.5B (~$7B) IPO — would be Malaysia's largest in a decade — but **likely scrapped** due to valuation disputes (40x P/E vs Westports' 20x).

## IPO history

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 2024 | IPO plans announced — largest Malaysia IPO in decade |
| Sept 2025 | Regulatory approval received |
| Q4 2025 | Postponed to 2026 (to include FY25 results) |
| Jan 2026 | **Likely scrapped** — valuation disputes |

---

## Why scrapped?

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Valuation gap** | Promoters wanted RM29.5B (~40x P/E) |
| **Market view** | Fund managers valued at ~RM20B |
| **Comp:** Westports | RM19.8B market cap at 20x P/E |
| **Structure** | Offer for sale only — no fresh capital, all proceeds to Syed Mokhtar |

Fund managers balked at 40x P/E when competitor Westports trades at 20x despite higher profitability.

## Comparison to Westports

| Metric | MMC Port | Westports |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue (FY24) | RM4.36B | RM2.34B |
| Net income (FY24) | RM761M | RM898M |
| Target/Market cap | RM29.5B | RM19.8B |
| P/E | ~40x | ~20x |

MMC has higher revenue but lower profits; was seeking 2x the P/E multiple.
