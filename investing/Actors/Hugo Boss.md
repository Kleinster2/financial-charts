# Hugo Boss

**German premium fashion house** — BOSS (premium, 77% of revenue) and HUGO (contemporary, 23%). €4.31B revenue (2024, +3% CC) — record level but growth slowing sharply. Missed €5B 2025 target. EBIT €361M (margin 8.4%, down from 9.8%). Stock -40% from 2023 highs. Key Coty fragrance license makes it relevant to both fashion and beauty. CEO Daniel Grieder's "CLAIM 5" growth strategy running into macro headwinds.

**The Permira connection:** Hugo Boss and [[Valentino]] were both owned by Italian textile group Marzotto, then acquired together by [[Permira]] in 2007 for a combined €2.6B. Permira exited Hugo Boss via IPO (2011-2014) but held Valentino until selling to [[Mayhoola]] in 2012.

**Current:** No controlling shareholder. ~64% free float. Largest holders are institutional investors.

| 2024 | 4.31 | +3% | 361 | 8% | Deceleration |

**The 2015-2020 crisis:** Revenue flat for 5 years as athleisure disrupted premium menswear. COVID then crushed the business (-32%). CLAIM 5 strategy (2022) drove recovery but momentum now fading.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stock -40% from highs, ~11x PE — cheap for branded fashion
- Q4 acceleration (+6% CC) shows potential recovery
- FCF of €497M — strong cash generation
- Americas growing +8%
- Fragrance license with [[Coty]] growing strongly
- HUGO brand gaining with younger consumers
- Margin recovery guided (9-10% vs 8.4%)

**Bear:**
- Growth collapsed (+27% → +3%) — was it just post-COVID bounce?
- Missed €5B target — credibility damaged
- China weakness (-2%) with unclear recovery
- Premium positioning squeezed (not luxury enough, not mass enough)
- Competition from true luxury (down-trending) and fast fashion (up-trending)
- CEO Grieder's "CLAIM 5" strategy underdelivering
