## Why Form Energy matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Technology | Iron-air battery |
| Duration | **100 hours** (vs 4hr lithium-ion) |
| Key advantage | Low cost, abundant materials |

## Technology: Reversible rusting

**How it works:**
- **Discharge:** Iron + oxygen + water → iron hydroxide (rust)
- **Charge:** Electricity reverses reaction, separates oxygen/water from iron
- **Materials:** Iron, water, air — abundant and cheap

**[[Trade]]-offs:**

| Metric | Iron-air | [[Lithium]]-ion |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Duration | 100 hours | 4 hours |
| Round-trip efficiency | ~60% | 90%+ |
| Fire risk | Very low | Higher |
| Degradation | Less over time | More |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |

## Projects (2025-2026)

| Project | Location | Capacity | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Great River Energy | Minnesota | 1.5 MW/150 MWh | End of 2025 |
| PG&E | California | 1.5 MW/150 MWh | Early 2026 |
| New York State | NY | 10 MW/1,000 MWh | 2026 |
| Puget Sound Energy | Washington | 10 MW/1,000 MWh | End of 2026 |
| Maine project | Maine | 85 MW/8.5 GWh | TBD |

## Manufacturing

**Form Factory 1 (Weirton, WV):**
- 550,000 sq ft facility
- Former steel mill site
- Trial production started
- DOE: $150M grant for expansion
- [[Target]]: 20 GWh/year by 2027

---

## Funding

| Round | Amount | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Series E (2024) | $405M | GE Vernova collaboration |
| DOE grant | $150M | Manufacturing expansion |
| California grant | $30M | PG&E pilot |
| NY grant | $12M | Demonstration project |
| Maine grant | $147M | Rural deployment |

**Total raised:** $800M+

## Why 100-hour matters

**Grid stability problem:**
- Renewables intermittent (solar/wind)
- [[Lithium]]-ion: 4 hours max economically
- Multi-day weather events need longer storage
- 100-hour bridges "dunkelflaute" (dark doldrums)

Form Energy = missing piece for 100% renewable grid.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only commercial 100-hour solution
- Abundant, cheap materials
- Grid desperately needs long-duration
- DOE/utility support
- Manufacturing scaling

**Bear:**
- Still early stage
- Lower efficiency than lithium-ion
- Unproven at scale
- Private (no public investment vehicle)
- Competition from other long-duration tech
