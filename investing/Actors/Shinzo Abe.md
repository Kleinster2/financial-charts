## Legacy

Every PM since Abe has continued his governance reform agenda. [[Hiromi Yamaji]] ([[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]): all successors "were quite big supporters of the governance reform, because all of them were convinced that growth of the private sector is essential."

His market-oriented reforms were necessary but not sufficient — the deflationary environment limited their impact. It took external shocks (Covid, Ukraine) to finally break deflation and create the conditions where Abe's structural reforms could fully express themselves.
