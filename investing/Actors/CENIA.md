**CENIA** — Chile's National Center for Artificial Intelligence. Building **Latam-GPT**, a 50B parameter open-source LLM trained on regional data. First Latin American sovereign AI model. Plans solar-powered Atacama data center.

> **Key insight:** Latam-GPT isn't trying to beat GPT-4 at general tasks. It's optimized for Latin American context—cultural nuances, regional Spanish/Portuguese, indigenous languages. The bet: a model trained on 8TB of regional data will outperform global models on LatAm-specific applications, from legal documents to customer service.

## Latam-GPT

**Latin America's first sovereign large language model.**

### Technical specs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parameters | **50 billion** (GPT-3.5 equivalent) |
| Training data | 8+ TB regionally sourced text |
| Languages | Spanish, Portuguese, Indigenous (Rapa Nui, others) |
| Architecture | Open-source |
| Partners | 33 strategic alliances across 12 countries |

### Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Development start | 2023 |
| Beta release (academic review) | October 2025 |
| Official launch | December 2025 |
| 1B+ documents processed | Pre-launch |

### Funding

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| CENIA | ~$300K |
| [[CAF]] | ~$250K |
| Univ. of Tarapacá | $5M (supercomputer with GPU) |
| **Total** | ~$550K direct + $5M compute |

Remarkably lean budget vs US AI labs spending billions.

## Why Latam-GPT matters

**Digital sovereignty argument:**

Most LLMs are built in US, China, or Europe. They're trained on English-dominant datasets and miss:
- Latin American Spanish/Portuguese variations
- Regional cultural context
- Indigenous languages
- Local legal/regulatory frameworks

**CENIA's pitch:**

> "It won't necessarily be better at topics like biochemistry or business models—unless they are Latin American—but its great strength will lie in knowledge of local contexts. Latam-GPT will know more, and better, about Latin America than any other model."

## Infrastructure plans

### Current: Amazon Cloud

Temporary hosting on AWS during development phase.

### Future: Atacama solar data center

Plans to migrate to a **solar-powered data center in Chile's Atacama Desert**—one of the sunniest places on Earth.

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Solar power | Near-zero marginal energy cost |
| Location | Chile's clean energy advantage |
| Sovereignty | Data stays in LatAm |
| ESG | Carbon-neutral AI |

---

## Partner network

**33 strategic alliances** including:

| Type | Partners |
|------|----------|
| Academic | Universities across 12 countries |
| Government | National AI agencies |
| Development | [[CAF]], ECLAC |
| Tech | Regional compute providers |

Training distributed across facilities including University of Tarapacá (Chile) and cloud platforms.

## Latin American AI Index (ILIA)

CENIA publishes the **Índice Latinoamericano de Inteligencia Artificial**—annual benchmarking of AI progress across the region.

Evaluates:
- Infrastructure
- Data availability
- Human talent
- Regulatory frameworks

Referenced in WEF/McKinsey "Latin America in the Intelligent Age" report.

## Competitive positioning

| Model | Parameters | Focus | Open source |
|-------|------------|-------|-------------|
| **Latam-GPT** | 50B | LatAm context | Yes |
| GPT-4 | ~1.8T (rumored) | General | No |
| Llama 3 | Up to 405B | General | Yes |
| Claude | Undisclosed | General | No |

Latam-GPT competes on **specialization**, not scale.

---

## Applications

Expected use cases:

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Government | Citizen services in regional Spanish |
| Legal | LatAm legal document analysis |
| Education | Culturally relevant content |
| Healthcare | Regional health information |
| Business | LatAm market intelligence |

---

## Investment implications

**CENIA not directly investable** (research center), but Latam-GPT signals:

| Trend | Beneficiaries |
|-------|---------------|
| Sovereign AI movement | Regional cloud providers |
| Specialized LLMs | Fine-tuning service providers |
| LatAm AI adoption | [[Mercado Libre]], [[Nubank]] (potential users) |
| Chilean AI ecosystem | [[Santiago Data Hub]], local tech |
