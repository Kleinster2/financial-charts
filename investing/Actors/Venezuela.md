**Venezuela** — World's largest proven oil reserves. Collapsed production due to nationalization, mismanagement, sanctions. **January 2026:** US captured Maduro in military strike — regime change, oil market uncertainty.

## Why Venezuela matters

Venezuela is a cautionary tale and potential swing factor:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Proven reserves | ~300B barrels (world's largest) |
| Peak production | ~3.5M bpd (late 1990s) |
| Current production | ~900K bpd |
| State company | PDVSA |
| Political system | Post-Maduro (captured Jan 2026) |

---

## The collapse

**From oil giant to basket case:**

| Era | Production | What happened |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| 1990s | 3.5M bpd | Peak, foreign investment |
| 2000s | 2.5M bpd | Chavez nationalizations begin |
| 2007 | — | Major nationalizations, Exxon/Conoco exit |
| 2010s | 2M → 1M bpd | Mismanagement, brain drain |
| 2019 | 700K bpd | US sanctions (Trump) |
| 2023+ | ~900K bpd | Partial recovery, Chevron license |

**Root cause:** Nationalization drove out expertise, PDVSA became patronage vehicle.

---

## 2007 nationalizations

**Chavez forced restructuring:**
- Foreign companies had to become minority partners (max 40%)
- PDVSA took 60%+ control of all projects
- Companies that refused were expropriated

| Company | Response |
|---------|----------|
| [[Exxon]] | Refused, exited, sued |
| ConocoPhillips | Refused, exited, sued |
| [[Chevron]] | Accepted minority role, stayed |
| Total, Statoil, BP | Accepted, stayed |

**Chevron's bet:** Staying would pay off eventually.

---

## Arbitration awards

**Expropriated companies won billions:**

| Company | Award | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| ConocoPhillips | $8.7B | Collecting (seized PDVSA assets) |
| [[Exxon]] | $1.6B | Partial collection |
| Others | Various | Ongoing |

Venezuela/PDVSA largely unable to pay — assets seized in Caribbean.

---

## US sanctions

**Trump era (2019):**
- Banned US companies from dealing with PDVSA
- Chevron got limited "wind-down" license
- Production cratered further
- Goal: Pressure Maduro to leave

**Biden era (2022+):**
- Granted Chevron license to resume operations (Nov 2022)
- Tied to democratic reforms (not delivered)
- Chevron ramping production
- License renewed but uncertain

---

## Chevron's unique position

**Only US company with Venezuela license:**

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Exclusive access | No US competition |
| Existing infrastructure | Never fully left |
| PDVSA relationship | Maintained ties |
| Upside optionality | If sanctions lift fully |

**Risk:** License depends on US politics — could be revoked.

---

## Production potential

**If sanctions lifted and investment returned:**

| Scenario | Production potential |
|----------|---------------------|
| Current (limited) | ~900K-1M bpd |
| Moderate investment | 1.5-2M bpd |
| Full rehabilitation | 2.5-3M bpd (years away) |

**Reality:** Infrastructure degraded, expertise gone, would take years and billions.

---

## Investment angle

**Not directly investable**, but:
- [[Chevron]] — only US company with access
- Oil prices — Venezuela supply affects global market
- Sanctions policy — watch US politics

**Chevron's Venezuela exposure:** ~5-10% of production if ramped up.

---

## Geopolitics (pre-2026)

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Russia/China | Providing support to Maduro |
| Refugee crisis | Millions fled to Colombia, US |
| Elections | Disputed 2024 election, Maduro stayed |
| US policy | Uncertain under new administration |

---

## January 2026 — US captures Maduro

**Major breaking news (January 3, 2026):**

| Event | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| US military strike | Targeted operation in Venezuela |
| Maduro captured | Along with wife Cilia Flores |
| Extradition | Flown to New York |
| Charges | Narco-terrorism indictment unsealed |
| Trump announcement | US will "run" Venezuela, take control of oil |

**Trump's oil statement:**
- US will "run" Venezuela temporarily during transition
- US will take control of Venezuela's oil reserves
- American companies to invest billions to rebuild industry
- "We built Venezuela's oil industry"

**Key implications:**

- **Regime change:** First US military capture of sitting foreign leader
- **PDVSA:** To be run by US during transition
- **[[Chevron]]:** Only current US operator — status uncertain
- **[[Exxon]]:** Could potentially return under new regime
- **Oil prices:** Near-term volatility, long-term bearish if supply grows

**International reaction:** UN "deeply alarmed," called it "illegal abduction" and dangerous precedent.

**Watch:**
- Transition government formation
- US oil company investments
- Chevron operational continuity
- Other majors' interest (Exxon return?)

## Foreign creditors & rivals

**China (~$60B exposure):**

| Actor | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[China]] | ~$60B in loans since 2007 |
| [[CNPC]] | ~$20B loans, Orinoco JVs |
| [[Sinopec]] | Oil buyer, refinery feedstock |
| Repayment | Oil-for-loans arrangements |

**Post-Maduro:** Chinese debt repayment uncertain. US may displace Chinese oil access. JV status in question.

**Russia:**

| Support type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [[Russia]] | Political/military backer |
| Rosneft | Had oil stakes (sold 2020 to avoid sanctions) |
| Arms | Military equipment supplier |

**Post-Maduro:** Russia loses key Latin America ally.

**The shift:**

| Before (Maduro) | After (US control) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| China/Russia primary partners | US companies prioritized |
| Oil to China (sanctions workaround) | Oil to US Gulf Coast refiners |
| Chinese loans serviced | Debt status uncertain |
| Sanctioned from US | US "running" country |

**Where oil went:** China was primary buyer (~300-400K bpd) because US sanctions blocked American buyers. [[Sinopec]], [[CNPC]] refineries in China processed Venezuelan heavy crude. India also bought opportunistically at deep discounts.

**Investment implication:** [[Gulf Coast refiners]] ([[Valero]], [[PBF Energy]]) and [[Chevron]] gain at expense of [[CNPC]], [[Sinopec]].
