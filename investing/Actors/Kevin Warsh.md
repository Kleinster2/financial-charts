## Fed Chair nomination

### Nominated Jan 30, 2026

Trump named Warsh as his pick to replace [[Jerome Powell]].

**Market reaction:**

| Asset | Move | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 10Y yield | +2bp to 4.25% | Less dovish Fed expected |
| 2Y yield | -2bp to 3.53% | Near-term cuts still priced |
| 30Y yield | +3bp to 4.89% | Balance sheet concerns (Warsh opposes Fed holding bonds/MBS) |
| S&P 500 | -0.4% | |
| Nasdaq | -0.6% | |
| Dollar | ↑ | Credibility boost |
| **Gold** | **-9%** | Worst day in decade; safe haven unwind |
| **Silver** | **-26%** | Largest single-day drop on record |
| XLF | Stable | Deregulation, steeper curve |
| KRE | Outperform | Dodd-Frank relief expected |

**Precious metals crash:** The nomination triggered the [[Silver crash January 2026]] — silver plunged 26% ($40/oz) in under 20 hours, the largest single-day drop on record. Gold fell 9%, its worst day in over a decade. The dollar rally unwound a speculative [[Gamma squeeze]] that had driven silver to $121/oz and gold to $5,595/oz.

**Curve steepened** — Warsh seen as more hawkish long-term but aligned with Trump on near-term cuts.

**Analyst reaction:**
- **BMO:** "By selecting Warsh, the Administration has clearly offered a nod to the necessity of Fed credibility"
- **El-Erian:** "Strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills"
- **Jamie Dimon:** Had signaled support, called Warsh candidate with "market credibility"

### "Battle of the Kevins" (resolved)

| Metric | Warsh | [[Kevin Hassett]] |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Kalshi odds (Jan 16) | **60%** | **16%** |
| Trump proximity | Distant | Daily contact (NEC) |
| Independence perception | Higher | Lower |
| Market credibility | Higher | Lower |

**Jan 16 shift:** Trump publicly said he wants Hassett to stay at NEC. Warsh now clear front-runner.

### Market reaction (Jan 16)

| Tenor | Move |
|-------|------|
| 2Y | 3.56% → 3.59% (+3bp) |
| 10Y | 3.96% → 4.02% (+6bp) |
| Warsh odds | 39% → 60% |

Curve steepened — Warsh = fewer rate cuts vs Hassett ("cut early, cut often").

**Evercore:** "Warsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm."

### Warsh advantages

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fed experience | 5 years on Board (2006-2011) |
| Crisis experience | Served through GFC |
| Market credibility | [[Morgan Stanley]] background |
| Independence | Distance from White House |
| Institutional knowledge | Knows how Fed operates |

### Warsh concerns

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Trump relationship | Less close than Hassett |
| Dovish views | May cut aggressively under pressure |

~~Academic since 2011~~ — Countered by [[Stanley Druckenmiller|Druckenmiller]] partnership at [[Duquesne Family Office]].

## Trump's view

**Dec 2025:** "I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great."

**Trump also said** Warsh is "at top of Fed chair candidate list" and that president "should be consulted on rates."

---

## Market view

Traders see Warsh as "Goldilocks" solution:
- Fed experience satisfies institutional concerns
- [[Morgan Stanley]] background provides market credibility
- Distance from Trump preserves independence optics
- Dovish views align with Trump's rate preferences

## Structural risks (Sandbu analysis)

[[Martin Sandbu]] ([[Financial Times]], Jan 31, 2026) argues the key risks aren't about Warsh's policy views:

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Political pressure** | Fed Chair role now under sustained pressure not seen for decades — tilts mandate toward growth/employment regardless of Warsh's orthodoxy |
| **Global public goods** | Swap lines and global bank regulation may be curtailed — Warsh's tolerance for "market self-correction" compounds this |
| **[[Greenspan put]] tension** | Warsh's "tough love" instinct vs Trump's expectation of turbocharged market bailouts |

> "That tension, rather than monetary policy, may be the real challenge Warsh will sooner or later have to face."

The insight: personnel matters less than the structural change in the job itself.
