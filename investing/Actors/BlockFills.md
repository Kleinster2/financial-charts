## Withdrawal suspension (Feb 2026)

Around Feb 7, 2026, BlockFills suspended all client deposits and withdrawals, citing "recent market and financial conditions." [[Bitcoin]] had fallen ~50% from its Oct 2025 ATH of $126K, briefly dipping below $60K.

| Detail | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Deposits | Suspended |
| Withdrawals | Suspended |
| Spot/derivative trading | Still allowed (with restrictions) |
| Margin calls | May force-close positions |
| Timeline to restore | Not given |

Company statement: "Management has been working hand in hand with investors and clients to bring this issue to a swift resolution and to restore liquidity to the platform."

### Why it matters

- Institutional-first distress — Unlike 2022 (Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager hit retail first), BlockFills serves 2,000+ institutional clients including crypto hedge funds and asset managers
- Miner contagion risk — BlockFills is a known lender to [[Bitcoin]] miners operating at thin margins in the current price environment. Forced liquidation of miner collateral could trigger further BTC selling pressure
- Echoes of 2022 — Same pattern as Genesis, BlockFi, Celsius: withdrawal freeze → liquidity crisis → contagion. But this time the distress is hitting institutional plumbing first
- Paper Bitcoin thesis — Bitcoin futures/derivatives markets may operate with less on-chain backing than assumed, creating fractional reserve dynamics in what was designed as a trustless system
