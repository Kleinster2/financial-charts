## Strategy: single-brand vs multi-brand

Li Ning's approach is the opposite of [[Anta Sports]]:

| Factor | Li Ning | [[Anta Sports]] |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Strategy | One brand, multiple categories | Multi-brand portfolio |
| Brands | Li Ning only | Anta, [[Fila]], [[Descente]], [[Kolon Sport]], [[Jack Wolfskin]] |
| Positioning | Professional sports + fashion | Mass to premium spectrum |
| Olympic tie | COC partner 2025-2028 | COC partner until 2024 |
| International target | 30% of revenue by 2025E | Amer Sports handles global |

## H1 2025 outlook

Interim profit fell 11% amid weak consumer sentiment in [[China]]. For full year 2025, Li Ning guided flat revenue and high single-digit net profit margin gain — suggesting further cost-cutting rather than top-line growth.
