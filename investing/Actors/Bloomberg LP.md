## History

**1981 — The severance bet:**
Michael Bloomberg, a general partner at Salomon Brothers, was pushed out after the firm sold to Phibro Corporation. At age 39, he took his **$10M severance** and founded Innovative Market Systems (later Bloomberg LP) with Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar.

**1982 — Merrill Lynch contract:**
Bloomberg secured a **$30M contract** from Merrill Lynch, which also took a 12% ownership stake. The first terminal shipped in December 1982.

**Growth milestones:**

| Year | Terminals | Revenue | Notes |

| 2022 | 325,000 | — | Current subscriber base |
| 2024 | — | ~$13B | Estimated revenue |

**Key insight:** Bloomberg discovered that financial professionals would pay premium prices ($20-30K/year) for a terminal that combined data, analytics, news, and messaging in one system. The chat function ("Bloomberg Message") created network effects — traders needed terminals to talk to other traders.

## What makes Bloomberg, Bloomberg

**The flywheel:**
```
More subscribers → Better chat network → More essential → Higher prices → More R&D → Better product → More subscribers
```

**Moats:**
- **Network effects:** Bloomberg Message is how Wall Street communicates. Can't leave if counterparties are on Bloomberg.
- **Switching costs:** Workflows, keyboard shortcuts, muscle memory built over decades
- **Data breadth:** 35M+ instruments, proprietary indices, historical depth
- **Bundling:** News + data + analytics + trading + chat in one terminal

**The math:** 325,000 terminals × $25K/year = $8B+ just from subscriptions. Add enterprise data licensing and media, and you get to $13B.
