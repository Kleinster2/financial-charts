## Market position

- #1 in China HCM SaaS for 9 consecutive years (IDC, since 2016)
- 11.6% share among ~300 market players — larger than #2 and #3 combined
- China HCM SaaS market projected to grow from ~RMB 4.5B (2022) to ~RMB 18.8B by 2027 (CAGR ~33%)

Competitors:

| Competitor | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| CDP Group | HCM SaaS+, payroll, benefits (Shanghai) |
| Moka | Recruiting-focused (Beijing) |
| [[Workday]] | Limited China penetration (data sovereignty barriers) |
| [[SAP]] SuccessFactors | Limited China penetration |

International vendors ([[Workday]], [[SAP]], [[Oracle]]) have minimal China presence due to data sovereignty and localization requirements — Beisen owns the domestic market.

## Investment case

Bull:
- #1 in China HCM SaaS with widening lead (9 consecutive years)
- 70% Fortune China 500 penetration — enterprise moat
- First profit turnaround — inflection point for re-rating
- AI monetization showing traction (RMB 26M+ contract value, 800+ customers)
- HCM SaaS TAM growing ~33% CAGR through 2027
- Cool College acquisition expands to learning/L&D
- International HCM vendors can't compete on data sovereignty

Bear:
- $645M market cap vs $421M total raised — limited value creation post-funding
- Revenue still under $200M/year — small scale
- Chinese SMB/mid-market unwilling to pay for SaaS
- FY2024 impairment losses signal earlier overvaluation of assets
- [[SoftBank]] Vision Fund overhang
- China macro weakness reduces enterprise HR spending
