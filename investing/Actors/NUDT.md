**NUDT (National University of [[Defense]] Technology)** — [[China]]'s top military research university. Built Tianhe supercomputers. PLA-affiliated. On US entity list.

---

## Why NUDT matters

The military side of [[China]]'s AI ecosystem:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Changsha, Hunan |
| Affiliation | People's Liberation Army (PLA) |
| Focus | [[Defense]] tech, supercomputing, AI |
| Status | Entity List (US export controls) |
| Significance | Tianhe supercomputers |

## Tianhe supercomputers

NUDT's flagship achievement:

| System | Year | Peak performance | Note |
|--------|------|------------------|------|
| Tianhe-1 | 2009 | 2.5 PFLOPS | First [[China]] #1 ranking |
| Tianhe-1A | 2010 | 4.7 PFLOPS | World #1 (briefly) |
| Tianhe-2 | 2013 | 54.9 PFLOPS | World #1 for years |
| Tianhe-2A | 2018 | 100+ PFLOPS | Upgraded |
| Tianhe-3 | 2021+ | Exascale target | In development |

**Tianhe-2 used [[Intel]] Xeon + Xeon Phi** — until US export controls (2015) forced domestic chip development.

## AI and military applications

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Autonomous systems | Drone swarms, autonomous vehicles |
| Computer vision | Satellite imagery, surveillance |
| Simulation | Weapons testing, war games |
| Cryptography | Code breaking, secure communications |

**Civil-military fusion:** NUDT research flows to both PLA and commercial applications. Boundaries are blurred by design.

---

## Entity List status

NUDT was added to the US Entity List in 2015:

| Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| US chips | Cannot purchase directly |
| US software | Restricted |
| Collaboration | US researchers cannot collaborate |
| Impact | Forced domestic chip development |

**Response:** NUDT accelerated work on domestic processors:
- [[Matrix]]-2000 (DSP accelerator)
- Collaboration with domestic chip firms
- Less dependent on [[Intel]]/[[AMD]]

---

## Relationship to commercial AI

| Connection | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Talent flow | Graduates join defense + commercial |
| Research | Dual-use AI published openly |
| Startups | Alumni in surveillance, robotics |
| Compute | Tianhe available for select projects |

**Key tension:** Some NUDT research is open, some classified. Hard to trace lineages.

---

## Comparison to US

| Aspect | NUDT ([[China]]) | US equivalent |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Military university | Yes (PLA) | Service academies, NPS |
| Supercomputing | Tianhe | DOE labs (Oak Ridge, Livermore) |
| AI research | Integrated | Separate (DARPA funds universities) |
| Civil-military | Fused | Separated (nominally) |

---

## Investment implications

**Not investable** (military institution).

**Indirect relevance:**
- Represents compute capacity not in commercial metrics
- Alumni in commercial surveillance/AI
- Explains why some [[China]] AI advances seem to "appear suddenly"

**Thesis implications:**
- [[China]] AI capability includes non-commercial compute
- Entity List forces domestic innovation
- Civil-military fusion means commercial AI has defense applications

---

## Risks (for [[China]] watchers)

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Opacity | Hard to assess true capability |
| Sanctions | Could expand to more affiliates |
| Talent | Graduates may face visa issues |
