# Ember

British energy think tank focused on accelerating the global electricity transition from coal to clean. Known for authoritative open-source data on electricity generation, capacity, and emissions worldwide. Cited by [[Adam Tooze]] as a model for how Western expertise can constructively engage with the China-led energy transition.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Type** | Independent not-for-profit (Community Interest Company) |
| **Founded** | 2008 as Sandbag; rebranded Ember March 2020 |
| **Founder** | Baroness Bryony Worthington |
| **HQ** | England & Wales |
| **Focus** | Electricity transition data and policy |

**Name origin:** "Ember" evokes the dying age of coal, but also the start of something new.

## History

**2008 — Sandbag era:** Founded by Baroness Bryony Worthington to reform the EU carbon market (ETS). Successfully pushed reforms that raised carbon price from €2 to €30.

**2010s — Coal focus:** Deeper emissions data analysis revealed coal power as Europe's biggest climate problem. Shifted focus from carbon market mechanics to coal phase-out.

**March 2020 — Ember rebrand:** Marked global expansion beyond Europe and laser focus on electricity transition. Established policy teams across Europe and Asia.

**2025 findings:**
- Renewables generated more power than coal globally for first time ever
- Low-carbon sources reached 40.9% of global electricity (2024)
- Solar + wind now meeting all new electricity demand growth

### Electricity Data Explorer

Interactive tool for electricity demand, generation, capacity, and emissions by country. Open-source data infrastructure.

### Regional reviews

- European Electricity Review
- Asia-Pacific analysis
- Country-specific deep dives

## Key data (2025)

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Global renewable capacity added (2025) | 793 GW projected |
| Solar + wind share of global electricity | 17.6% (Q1-Q3 2025) |
| Low-carbon total | 43% of global electricity |
| H1 2025 demand growth | +2.6% (+369 TWh) |
| Solar generation growth | +31% (+306 TWh) |

**Key finding (H1 2025):** Global emissions fell slightly (-12 MtCO2) despite demand growth. China (-46 MtCO2) and India (-24 MtCO2) drove declines; US (+33 MtCO2) and EU (+13 MtCO2) increased.

## Why Tooze cites Ember

In his 2025 LRB lecture, Tooze identifies Ember as exemplary of how Western expertise should engage with China's dominance:

> "Not from the position of panda-hugging CCP groupies, but from the position of experts who make it their job to document around the world the flow of Chinese funds in ways that the Chinese themselves don't understand... equipping their counterparts in recipient countries with the tools to haggle, to negotiate, to force the Chinese to terms."

Ember's contribution: mapping [[Electrostate]] dynamics (electrification vs decarbonization) that show where each country sits in the transition.
