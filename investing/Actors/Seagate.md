**Seagate** — HDD leader. Nearline drives for hyperscaler data centers. AI data storage play.

---

## Why Seagate matters

HDDs are the "cold storage" layer of AI infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | STX |
| Market cap | ~$20B |
| Business | Hard disk drives (HDD) |
| Customers | Hyperscalers, enterprise, consumer |
| Competitor | [[Western Digital]] |

---

## Product focus

| Segment | Products | Trend |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Nearline** | High-capacity datacenter HDDs | Growing (AI data) |
| **Enterprise** | Mission-critical storage | Stable |
| **[[Consumer]]** | External drives, gaming | Declining |

**Nearline is the story** — 20TB+ drives for hyperscaler cold storage.

---

## AI storage angle

Every AI model needs data:

| Stage | Storage need |
|-------|--------------|
| Training data | Petabytes of raw data |
| Checkpoints | Model snapshots during training |
| Inference logs | User interaction data |
| Data lakes | Long-term retention |

**HDDs vs SSDs**: HDDs are 5-10x cheaper per TB. Cold data lives on spinning rust.

## Hyperscaler customers

| Customer | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Azure cold storage |
| [[Amazon]] | S3 Glacier backend |
| [[Google]] | Cloud storage, YouTube archive |
| [[Meta]] | Photo/video archive |

Hyperscaler nearline demand is the growth driver.

## Competitive position

| Factor | Seagate | [[Western Digital]] |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| HDD focus | Pure-play | HDD + NAND |
| Nearline share | ~50% | ~50% |
| Technology | HAMR (heat-assisted) | ePMR, MAMR |
| Margin profile | Higher (pure HDD) | Mixed |

Seagate bet on HAMR technology for capacity scaling.

---

## HAMR technology

**Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording:**
- Uses laser to heat disk during write
- Enables higher areal density
- 30TB+ drives shipping
- Roadmap to 50TB+

**Risk**: Technology transition. HAMR ramp had delays.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI data explosion drives nearline demand
- [[Hyperscaler capex]] growing
- HDD cost advantage vs SSD persists
- HAMR technology leadership
- Dividend yield (~3%)

**Bear:**
- SSD prices falling, closing gap
- [[Consumer]] HDD declining
- Cyclical demand
- HAMR execution risk
- [[China]] exposure

## Q2 FY2026 earnings (Jan 27, 2026)

**Stock +19% on AI-driven storage demand beat.**

| Metric | Q2 FY26 | vs Estimate | YoY |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Revenue | **$2.83B** | Beat ($2.71B) | +22% |
| EPS (adj) | **$3.11** | Beat ($2.83) | — |
| Gross margin | **42.2%** | +6.7 ppts | — |
| Operating margin | **31.9%** | +8.8 ppts | — |

**Q3 FY26 guidance:**
- Revenue: $2.9B ± $100M
- EPS: $3.40 ± $0.20

**Why the beat:**
- Record gross and operating margins
- Robust data center demand for nearline HDDs
- HAMR (Mozaic) product ramp accelerating
- Strong pricing power — demand up, supply limited

**Analyst upgrades:**
| Firm | Action | New PT |
|------|--------|--------|
| Morgan Stanley | Raised PT | **$468** (from $372) |
| Mizuho | Raised PT | **$440** (from $400) |
