## Digital Currency Initiative (DCI)

Launched 2015 by Joichi Ito under the MIT Media Lab. Became the institutional home for [[Bitcoin]] Core developers after the Bitcoin Foundation's bankruptcy:

| Developer | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Gavin Andresen | Lead maintainer (post-[[Satoshi Nakamoto]]) |
| Wladimir van der Laan | Core maintainer |
| Cory Fields | Core developer |

Funded in part by $525K from [[Jeffrey Epstein]] donations to MIT Media Lab. Ito used Epstein's gift funds to move quickly on recruiting developers. Epstein also co-invested in [[Blockstream]] ($500K) with Ito via Kyara Investments III.

**Controversy:** A convicted sex offender's donations effectively underwrote the institutional home of Bitcoin's core development. No evidence of protocol-level interference, but the funding relationship was concealed until the 2019 Media Lab scandal forced Ito's resignation.
