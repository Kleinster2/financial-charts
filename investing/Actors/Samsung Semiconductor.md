**[[Samsung]] Semiconductor** — World's largest memory maker, \#2 foundry. Aggressive but struggling vs TSMC. Part of [[Samsung]] Electronics conglomerate.

## Why [[Samsung]] Semiconductor matters

[[Samsung]] is the only company competing across memory AND logic:

| Business | Position |
|----------|----------|
| DRAM | \#1 globally (~40% share) |
| NAND | \#2 (behind SK Hynix in value) |
| Foundry | \#2 (distant behind TSMC) |
| HBM | \#3 (behind SK Hynix, Micron) |

---

## Foundry struggles

**Losing ground to TSMC:**

| Node | [[Samsung]] status |
|------|----------------|
| 3nm GAA | First to market, low yields |
| 2nm | Targeting 2025, behind schedule |
| [[Advanced packaging]] | Behind TSMC CoWoS |

**Key problems:**
- Yield issues at advanced nodes
- Customer defections ([[Qualcomm]], NVIDIA)
- TSMC moat widening
- Talent drain

See [[Can Samsung ever catch TSMC]] for analysis.

## Memory dominance

**Still the memory king:**

| Product | Position |
|---------|----------|
| DRAM | \#1 market share |
| NAND | \#2 (SK Hynix gaining) |
| HBM | **\#3** — struggling |

**HBM problem:** SK Hynix dominates AI memory. [[Samsung]] late, quality issues with NVIDIA qualification.

---

## HBM crisis

**Critical for AI thesis:**
- HBM is memory for AI accelerators
- [[SK Hynix]] supplies most HBM to NVIDIA
- [[Samsung]] struggling for NVIDIA qualification
- May have finally qualified HBM3E (late 2025)
- Losing the AI memory boom

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| [[Apple]] | Was foundry, now mostly memory |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Foundry (some defected to TSMC) |
| [[Google]] | TPU foundry (some) |
| [[NVIDIA]] | Memory (limited HBM) |

**Lost:** Many customers defected to TSMC due to yield issues.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Memory cycle upturn
- HBM qualification progress
- Foundry investment ($300B+ over decade)
- Vertical integration advantage
- Undervalued vs peers

**Bear:**
- Foundry gap widening vs TSMC
- HBM behind SK Hynix
- Yield problems persistent
- Management/governance issues
- Conglomerate discount

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Samsung]] Electronics (005930.KS) |
| Semiconductor revenue | ~$70B |
| Memory share | DRAM \#1, NAND \#2 |
| Foundry share | ~12% (vs TSMC ~60%) |
| HBM share | ~15% (vs SK Hynix ~50%) |
| Foundry capex | $300B+ planned over decade |

**Note:** [[Samsung]] Semiconductor is division of [[Samsung]] Electronics — includes mobile, display, appliances.

## vs Competitors

| Aspect | [[Samsung]] | [[TSMC]] | [[SK Hynix]] |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Memory | \#1 DRAM | None | \#2 DRAM, \#1 HBM |
| Foundry | \#2 (struggling) | \#1 (dominant) | None |
| HBM | \#3 | None | \#1 |
| Focus | Both | Logic only | Memory only |
