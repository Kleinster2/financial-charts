**PDVSA (Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.)** — Venezuela's state-owned oil and natural gas company. Historically one of the world's largest oil companies, now a shadow of its former self due to nationalization, mismanagement, and sanctions. Under US control post-[[Maduro capture 2026]].

## Current Status (Jan 2026)

*   **Ownership:** Technically still state-owned by Venezuela, but effectively controlled by the interim US-backed government.
*   **Management:** Old, politicized management (often military officers) being purged. US/Western expertise expected to be brought in.
*   **Production:** Around 150K bpd (Chevron's share) to ~1M bpd total. Far below potential of [[3M]]+ bpd.
*   **Infrastructure:** Severely degraded. Refineries operate at minimal capacity. Pipelines, storage, and drilling equipment require massive investment.
*   **Financials:** Deeply indebted (tens of billions). Creditors ([[China]], [[Russia]], bondholders) are major stakeholders. Assets (like Citgo) are collateralized or under legal challenge.
*   **Strategic Role:** The vehicle for Venezuela's oil production. Rebuilding PDVSA is synonymous with rebuilding Venezuelan oil.

## History & Decline

*   **1976:** Nationalized by Venezuela.
*   **1990s-early 2000s:** Highly efficient, world-class oil company.
*   **2007 (Chavez Era):** Nationalization of foreign stakes, politicization. Funds diverted to social programs. Expertise driven out.
*   **2014+:** Oil price crash exacerbates decline.
*   **2019+:** US sanctions (targeting PDVSA) cripple ability to sell crude internationally, further reducing production.
*   **2026 (Post-Maduro):** Under US control, focus shifts to capacity rebuild and financial restructuring.

## Challenges to Rebuild

*   **Security:** Ensuring safety of personnel and infrastructure in a post-conflict environment.
*   **Expertise:** Re-attracting skilled engineers and managers.
*   **Capital:** Billions in investment needed for maintenance, upgrades, and new drilling. Requires resolving debt and legal disputes.
*   **Corruption:** Deep-seated issues that require systemic overhaul.
*   **Legal:** Resolving claims from past nationalizations (e.g., Exxon, ConocoPhillips).

## Key Assets

*   **Oil Reserves:** World's largest proven reserves (303B barrels), primarily heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt.
*   **Refining:** Amuay, Cardón (Paraguaná Refining Complex), El Palito, Puerto la Cruz. All operating significantly below capacity.
*   **Export Terminals:** Jose, Punto Fijo.
*   **[[Citgo]]**: US refining and marketing arm (currently in legal limbo, but still a critical asset).
