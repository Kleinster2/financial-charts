**Nanya Technology** — Taiwan's largest DRAM maker. 4th globally. [[Formosa Plastics Group]] subsidiary. Primary beneficiary of DDR4 pricing inversion as Big Three shift to [[HBM]].

## Why Nanya matters

Structural winner of the [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]]:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2408.TW (TWSE) |
| DRAM rank | #4 globally |
| Global DRAM share | ~2-3% |
| Parent | [[Formosa Plastics Group]] (~50%+ ownership) |
| HQ | New Taipei City, [[Taiwan]] |
| Founded | 1995 |
| Employees | ~3,600 |
| Fab capacity | ~70,000 12-inch wafers/month |

Small by global DRAM standards, but uniquely positioned: as [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], and [[Micron]] shift wafers to [[HBM]], Nanya is one of the few remaining dedicated DDR4 suppliers outside [[China]].

## The DDR4 pricing inversion

The defining dynamic for Nanya in 2025-2026:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DDR4/16G spot price | ~$45.50/unit |
| DDR5/16G spot price | ~$27.20/unit |
| DDR4 premium over DDR5 | **+67%** |

DDR4 now costs more than DDR5 because supply collapsed as Big Three reallocated capacity to [[HBM]] and DDR5. [[CXMT]] also retreating from DDR4. Nanya and [[Winbond Electronics]] are the primary non-Chinese suppliers left.

US cloud hyperscalers reportedly seeking DDR4 supply from Nanya directly — a first for a company of this scale.

## Technology and independence

| Generation | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 20nm (1A) | Production |
| 1B nm (2nd gen 10nm) | Current main node |
| 1C nm (3rd gen 10nm) | Trial production, first 16Gb DDR5 designed |
| 1D nm (4th gen 10nm) | In development |

**Key milestone:** Nanya achieved independent 10nm-class DRAM technology in 2020, ending dependence on [[Micron]] licensing. The [[Micron]] license had capped Nanya's market share at ~3% of global DRAM and was non-transferable with a change-of-control termination clause.

## Micron relationship history

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2003 | Joint venture **Inotera Memories** with [[Infineon]] |
| 2008 | [[Micron]]-Nanya JV MeiYa Technology ($1.1B combined) |
| 2009 | [[Micron]] begins 50nm tech transfer to Nanya/Inotera |
| 2015 | Nanya sells Inotera stake to [[Micron]] for ~$4.1B |
| 2017 | Nanya announces independent 10nm development |
| 2020 | Independent 10nm trial production |

The divorce from [[Micron]] was strategically necessary — the license terms were restrictive and capped growth.

## Products

| Line | Details |
|------|---------|
| Standard DRAM | DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 |
| Low Power | LPDDR4, LPDDR5 |
| MCP / eMCP | Multi-chip packages |
| Known Good Die | Bare die for packaging |
| Modules | SODIMM, UDIMM, RDIMM (Elixir brand) |
| Automotive | AEC-Q100, IATF16949, -40C to 105C |

**Revenue mix (Q4 2025):** DDR4/LPDDR4 >50% of revenue. DDR5 ~10% of shipments. Consumer ~60% of sales.

## Financials

**Q4 2025 — record quarter:**

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue (NT$B) | 18.8 | 30.1 |
| QoQ growth | +78% | +60% |
| YoY growth | +131% | +357% |
| Gross margin | 18.5% | 49.0% |
| Operating margin | 6.0% | 39.1% |
| Net income (NT$B) | 1.6 | 11.1 |
| EPS (NT$) | 0.50 | 3.58 (record) |
| Free cash flow (NT$B) | 3.8 | 12.9 |

**Full year 2025:** Revenue NT$66.6B (+95% YoY), net income NT$6.6B.

The margin expansion from Q3 to Q4 is extraordinary — gross margin went from 18.5% to 49.0% in a single quarter, driven entirely by DDR4 ASP increases with flat shipment volumes.

## New fab and expansion

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Taishan Nanlin Technology Park, New Taipei City |
| Total investment | ~NT$300B (~$10.1B), three phases over seven years |
| Target capacity | 45,000 wafers/month (on top of current 70K) |
| Equipment install | Early 2027 (delayed from 2024) |
| Jobs | 2,000+ direct |
| 2026 capex | ~NT$50B (2.7x 2025 level) |

## Edge AI strategy

Nanya is not pursuing server [[HBM]] (can't compete with Big Three on scale). Instead targeting customized HBM for edge AI:

| Initiative | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| [[PieceMakers Technology]] | NT$660M investment (~38% stake), Dec 2024. Custom ultra-high-bandwidth memory for edge AI. |
| [[Etron Technology]] JV | 80:20 Nanya:Etron, NT$500M. AI memory design for edge computing. Aug 2025. |
| First custom HBM product | End of 2026 target |
| Target markets | PCs, smartphones, robotics, automotive — not servers |

President Lee Pei-ing: Nanya cannot compete on capacity/cost with major players or [[China]]; differentiation via custom products is the path.

---

## Supply outlook

Nanya expects DRAM shortage through **first half of 2027**. Customers overbooking and seeking long-term supply commitments. DDR5, DDR4, DDR3, LPDDR5, LPDDR4 all in short supply.

## Price

![[2408tw-price-chart.png]]
*Parabolic from TWD 27 to 326 in a year — driven entirely by DDR4 pricing inversion as Big Three exit commodity DRAM for [[HBM]].*

![[2344tw-vs-2408tw-vs-2337tw-price-chart.png]]
*Taiwan memory trio normalized since Jan 2024. Nanya (red) and [[Winbond Electronics]] (blue) tracked closely at +300%, [[Macronix]] (green) lagged at +170% — reflecting DRAM shortage benefiting more than NOR flash.*
