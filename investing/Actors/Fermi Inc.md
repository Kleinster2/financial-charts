**Fermi Inc** — Texas data center developer. 11GW planned capacity. Rick Perry-backed. Lost $150M anchor tenant.

## Why Fermi Inc matters

Cautionary tale of speculative AI infrastructure buildout:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Planned capacity | **11GW** |
| Location | Texas |
| Key figure | Rick Perry (former US Energy Secretary) |
| Status | Lost anchor tenant |

---

## The project

**Texas mega-scale:**
- 11GW planned data center capacity
- One of largest announced US projects
- Rick Perry involvement (former Texas governor, Energy Secretary)
- Betting on Texas power grid and business environment

---

## Setback: Lost anchor tenant

**$150M tenant walked:**
- Major prospective tenant backed out
- ~$150M lost revenue commitment
- Illustrates risk of building without locked contracts
- Example of overbuild risk materializing

---

## Risk profile

**Speculative buildout:**

| Risk | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Anchor tenant | **Lost $150M commitment** |
| Capacity | 11GW is enormous |
| Competition | Many Texas projects |
| Power | ERCOT grid constraints |

**Key concern:** Building at scale without secured demand.

---

## Texas context

**Why Texas:**
- Business-friendly regulatory environment
- Independent ERCOT grid (deregulated)
- Abundant land
- Lower costs than coasts

**Risk:** ERCOT reliability (2021 winter crisis), power competition with crypto miners.

---

## Investment relevance

**What Fermi shows:**
- Not all AI infrastructure plays will succeed
- Hyperscaler anchor tenant = critical differentiator
- 11GW capacity is ambitious without contracts
- Political connections (Rick Perry) not sufficient
