## Relationship to [[Unit 8200]]

Talpiot and Unit 8200 are distinct but connected:
- **Talpiot** = elite training program (science/engineering focus)
- **Unit 8200** = signals intelligence unit (cyber/intel focus)

Many Talpiot grads serve in or alongside Unit 8200. The [[Wiz]] founders went through both.

---

## Investor interest

VCs specifically seek Talpiot/8200 founders:
- **Glilot Capital Partners** — founded by alumni
- **Axon Ventures** — strategy to fund fellow veterans

The credential signals: extreme selection, technical depth, military discipline, network effects.
