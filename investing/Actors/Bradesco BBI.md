## Investment relevance

**Why BBI matters:**

1. **Best of both worlds** — Parent bank struggles with fintech disruption, but BBI is winning. If Bradesco stock is a value trap, BBI is the hidden asset.

2. **Brazil infrastructure proxy** — Want exposure to Brazil capex cycle? BBI touches every major deal — energy, roads, data centers, sanitation.

3. **Green bond leadership** — Early mover on ESG-linked issuances. As sustainability mandates grow, BBI's expertise compounds.

4. **Privatization wave** — Sabesp done, Copasa coming (1Q 2026). BBI positioned for every major Brazil privatization.
