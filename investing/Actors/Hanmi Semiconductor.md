Korean semiconductor equipment maker, dominant in thermal compression (TC) bonders used for HBM packaging. The picks-and-shovels play on AI memory demand — but facing share erosion to [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] and [[ASMPT]].

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Ticker** | 042700.KS |
| **HQ** | Incheon, South Korea |
| **CEO** | Kwak Dong Shin |
| **Revenue (TTM)** | ~₩644B (~$489M) |
| **Market Cap** | ~$7.1B |
| **Founded** | 1980 |

## What they make

**TC bonders** — thermal compression bonding equipment that stacks memory dies for HBM production. When you see "HBM3E 12-layer stack," Hanmi's machines did the stacking.

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **TC bonders** | HBM die stacking (core business) |
| **2.5D big-die bonders** | Advanced packaging for AI chips (120mm x 120mm interposers) |
| **Hybrid bonders** | Next-gen HBM4/4E (in development) |

Six factories in Incheon producing TC bonders.

## Market position

**90%+ share** in HBM3E 12-layer TC bonder market — but that's the peak.

### Customer concentration

| Customer | Relationship | Trend |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | Historically sole TC bonder supplier | Share falling to 20-30% by 2026 |
| [[Micron]] | Current supplier | Losing to BESI for HBM4 |
| Chinese producers | Supplier | Geopolitical risk |

### The BESI problem

[[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] and [[ASMPT]] are taking share on precision requirements:

- **BESI** leads hybrid bonding with 100nm accuracy (Gen 2: 50nm, <4μm bump pitch)
- SK Hynix onboarding ASMPT for HBM3E/HBM4, phasing out Hanmi
- Micron expected to use BESI exclusively for HBM4

Hanmi's response: developing mild hybrid bonders (H2 2025) and full hybrid bonders (2026) — but playing catch-up.

## Product roadmap

| Timeline | Product |
|----------|---------|
| **H2 2024** | 2.5D big-die TC bonders (6x conventional size) |
| **H2 2025** | Mild hybrid bonders |
| **2026** | Full hybrid bonders |

Target: ₩2T (~$1.5B) revenue by 2026 — requires ~3x current run rate. Ambitious given share losses.

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2023 | ~₩183B | ~₩168B | Includes large one-time gains |
| 2024 | ~₩559B | ~₩153B | Revenue 3x; Q2 loss |
| 2025 Q1-Q3 | ₩494B | ₩185B | Run rate ~₩650B |

*Note: Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 net income exceeded revenue due to investment gains — not operating results.*

## Price chart

![[hanmi-semiconductor-price-chart.png]]
*Hanmi (blue) +4900% vs [[BE Semiconductor Industries|BESI]] (red) +450% since 2020. Hanmi's HBM dominance drove extraordinary returns, but the gap may narrow as BESI wins hybrid bonding.*

## Fundamentals

![[hanmi-semiconductor-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue ramped from ~₩30-50B/quarter (2023) to ~₩160-180B (2025) on HBM demand. Net income volatile — Q4 2023/Q1 2024 spikes were one-time gains, Q2 2024 was a loss, now stabilizing ~₩55-65B/quarter.*

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:** HBM demand explodes further; Hanmi defends share and successfully transitions to hybrid bonding; ₩2T revenue target achieved.

**Bear case:** BESI/ASMPT win hybrid bonding war; Hanmi's TC bonder share erodes faster than new products ramp; multiple compression as growth stalls.

The stock has priced in a lot of good news (+4900% since 2020). The share loss narrative to BESI is the key risk to monitor.

## Risks

- **Technology transition**: Hybrid bonding requires precision Hanmi hasn't demonstrated
- **Customer concentration**: SK Hynix diversifying away
- **Competition**: BESI has technology lead in next-gen equipment
- **Valuation**: Priced for perfection after massive run
