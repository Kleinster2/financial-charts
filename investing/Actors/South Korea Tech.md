| Micron | Distant \#3 |

SK Hynix = NVIDIA's primary [[HBM]] supplier.

---

## Samsung ecosystem

| Division | Products |
|----------|----------|
| [[Samsung Semiconductor]] | Memory, foundry |
| Samsung Display | OLED panels |
| [[Samsung SDI]] | EV batteries |
| Samsung Electronics | [[Consumer]] |

Vertically integrated tech giant.

---

## Foundry ambitions

**Samsung Foundry:**
- \#2 foundry globally
- 3nm GAA technology
- [[Apple]]/[[Qualcomm]] customer
- Texas fab investment
- Competing with TSMC

[[Gap]] with TSMC remains.

---

## Government support

**K-Chips Act:**
- $19B+ subsidies
- Tax incentives
- Fab investment support
- National priority

Memory = national security.

## AI superpower strategy (2025-2026)

**Goal: Top 3 AI power** (behind US, [[China]])

**Minister Bae Kyung-Hoon** (Science & ICT, also Deputy PM):
- Appointed July 2025
- Former head of LG AI Research (developed Exaone)
- PhD computer vision, Kwangwoon University

**Bae quote:**
> "We don't see ourselves as just another contender in that pack. We believe we have a real shot at becoming a serious global player — one capable of challenging the top two."

## AI spending & deals

| Initiative | Value | Partner |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **2026 AI budget** | **10.1T won ($6.9B)** | 3x increase |
| GPU purchase | 50,000 accelerators | [[NVIDIA]] |
| Total GPUs | 260,000 | NVIDIA to ministry + chaebols |
| Data centers | Renewable-powered | [[BlackRock]] |
| Physical AI | [[Robotics]], AVs | NVIDIA + [[Hyundai]] |
| Talent | 2,000 overseas engineers by 2030 | — |

**[[Jensen Huang]] (Oct 2025):**
> "Korea has a great chance to be a regional AI hub and one of the largest AI hubs in the world."

## Exaone — LG's frontier model

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Model | Exaone 4.0 |
| Developer | LG AI Research |
| [[Gap]] to GPT-5 | **5.9 months** ([[Microsoft]] AI Diffusion Report) |
| Status | Korea's leading frontier model |

Exaone developed under Bae before he joined government.

---

## AI infrastructure

| Initiative | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| National AI Strategy | Compute buildout |
| **Sovereign AI Competition** | National foundation model |
| Korean hyperscalers | Naver, Kakao |
| Research | KAIST, Seoul National |
| Startups | Growing ecosystem |

## Sovereign AI Competition (2025-2027)

**Korea's national AI foundation model race:**

| Phase | Date | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Applicants | 2025 | 15 teams |
| Finalists | Aug 2025 | 5 teams |
| Round 2 | Jan 2026 | 3 teams remain |
| Final | 2027 | 2 winners |

**Advancing teams (Jan 2026):**

| Team | Parent | Score |
|------|--------|-------|
| **LG AI Research** | LG Group | Highest |
| **SK [[Telecom]]** | SK Group | Advancing |
| **Upstage** | Startup | Advancing |

**Eliminated:**

| Team | Reason |
|------|--------|
| [[Naver]] Cloud | Used Chinese vision encoder (rule violation) |
| NC AI (NCSoft) | Low evaluation score |

**Winners receive:**
- Government-provided GPUs
- Access to datasets
- National champion status

**Vice Minister Ryu Je-myung:**
> "Our goal is to select two finalists through an extremely intense competition... Our broader objective is to encourage many more companies to compete and be stimulated by the project."

**Controversy:** "From scratch" requirement debated — questions whether some teams used non-Korean components.

## Naver & Kakao

**Korean tech giants:**

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Naver]] | Search, AI (HyperCLOVA) |
| [[Kakao]] | Messaging, fintech |

Korea's answer to [[Google]]/[[Meta]].

## US tariff escalation (Jan 2026)

**Trump raised tariffs on South Korea to 25%** (from 15%) on January 27, 2026, accusing Korea of "not living up to its Deal" with the US.

| Status | Tariff rate |
|--------|-------------|
| Previous | 15% |
| **Current (Jan 27, 2026)** | **25%** |

Impacts Samsung, SK Hynix, Hyundai exports to US. Memory chips likely exempt under semiconductor carve-outs, but consumer electronics and autos exposed.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Memory cycle recovery
- [[HBM]] for AI demand
- National champions
- Foundry potential

**Bear:**
- **US tariffs raised to 25%** (Jan 2026)
- TSMC foundry gap
- [[China]] competition
- Chaebol governance
- Cyclical exposure

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Memory share | ~60% global |
| Key players | Samsung, SK Hynix |
| [[HBM]] leader | SK Hynix |
| Foundry rank | \#2 (Samsung) |
