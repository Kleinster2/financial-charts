**MP Materials** — Only US rare earth miner at scale. Operates Mountain Pass (California) and magnet facility in Fort Worth (Texas). Key to US rare earth independence.

## Why MP Materials matters

MP Materials is the Western answer to China's rare earth dominance:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MP |
| Mountain Pass | Only US rare earth mine |
| Fort Worth | "Independence" magnet factory |
| Capacity target | 11,000 short tons magnets/year by 2028 |
| Key partners | [[Apple]], US Department of Defense |

## Facilities

### Mountain Pass, California

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Open-pit rare earth mine |
| History | Operated 1952-2002, restarted 2017 |
| Output | Light rare earths (Nd, Pr, La, Ce) |
| Limitation | No heavy REE separation (yet) |

**Challenge**: Mine produces ore, but separation historically went to China. MP is building domestic separation capacity.

### Fort Worth, Texas ("Independence")

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Magnet manufacturing |
| Status | Operational, expanding |
| Products | NdFeB permanent magnets |
| Customers | [[Apple]], defense |

## Apple partnership (July 2025)

$500M deal announced July 2025:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Value | $500M |
| Product | Recycled rare earth magnets |
| Facility | Fort Worth expansion |
| Feedstock | End-of-life devices, magnet scrap |
| Shipments | Begin 2027 |
| Volume | Hundreds of millions of Apple devices |

**Recycling angle**: Apple and MP spent 5 years piloting recycling tech. Commercial-scale recycling line at Mountain Pass will process:
- Magnet scrap
- End-of-life product components
- Post-industrial waste

See [[Apple MP Materials partnership]] for full details.

## Pentagon backing

DoD has provided significant funding:
- Multibillion-dollar investment package
- Supports magnet plant expansion
- 11,000 short tons/year capacity by 2028
- Defense supply chain priority

**Strategic logic**: US defense cannot depend on China for permanent magnets. MP is the only domestic alternative at scale.

---

## Competitive position

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Only US rare earth mine | No heavy REE (dysprosium) production |
| Apple/DoD anchors | Still small vs China |
| Recycling technology | Scaling risk |
| Magnet manufacturing | Cost disadvantage vs China |

**The gap**: MP does light rare earths (Nd, Pr). [[Dysprosium]] (the critical heavy REE) still comes from China. This limits how much supply chain risk MP can actually address.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Monopoly on US rare earth mining
- Apple anchor customer ($500M)
- DoD strategic priority
- Recycling technology differentiator
- China rare earth controls = tailwind

**Bear:**
- No heavy REE production
- Cost disadvantage vs China
- Small relative to global demand
- Execution risk on expansion
- Recycling economics unproven at scale
