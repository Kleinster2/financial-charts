**MP Materials** — Only US rare earth miner at scale. Operates Mountain Pass (California) and magnet facility in Fort Worth (Texas). Key to US rare earth independence.

## Why MP Materials matters

MP Materials is the Western answer to [[China]]'s rare earth dominance:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MP |
| Mountain Pass | Only US rare earth mine |
| Fort Worth | "Independence" magnet factory |
| Capacity target | 11,000 short tons magnets/year by 2028 |
| Key partners | [[Apple]], US Department of [[Defense]] |

---

## Facilities

### Mountain Pass, California

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Open-pit rare earth mine |
| History | Operated 1952-2002, reopened 2018 |
| Output | Light rare earths (Nd, Pr, La, Ce) |
| Limitation | No heavy REE separation (yet) |

**Challenge**: Mine produces ore, but separation historically went to [[China]]. MP is building domestic separation capacity.

### Fort Worth, Texas ("Independence")

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Magnet manufacturing |
| Status | Operational, expanding |
| Products | NdFeB permanent magnets |
| Customers | [[Apple]], defense |

## Apple partnership (July 2025)

$500M deal announced July 2025:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Value | $500M |
| Product | Recycled rare earth magnets |
| Facility | Fort Worth expansion |
| Feedstock | End-of-life devices, magnet scrap |
| Shipments | Begin 2027 |
| Volume | Hundreds of millions of Apple devices |

**Recycling angle**: Apple and MP spent 5 years piloting recycling tech. Commercial-scale recycling line at Mountain Pass will process:
- Magnet scrap
- End-of-life product components
- Post-industrial waste

See [[Apple MP Materials partnership]] for full details.

## Pentagon backing

**$400M DoD equity investment (July 2025):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | $400M equity |
| Investor | US Department of [[Defense]] |
| Stake | **Largest shareholder** post-deal |
| Purpose | Magnet plant expansion |
| Capacity target | 11,000 short tons/year by 2028 |
| **Purchase guarantee** | **10-year commitment** to buy all magnet output |

**Strategic logic**: US defense cannot depend on [[China]] for permanent magnets. MP is the only domestic alternative at scale.

**Timeline:** Pentagon investment announced July 2025, followed 5 days later by Apple $500M deal.

## Competitive position

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Only US rare earth mine | No heavy REE (dysprosium) production |
| Apple/DoD anchors | Still small vs [[China]] |
| Recycling technology | Scaling risk |
| Magnet manufacturing | Cost disadvantage vs [[China]] |

**The gap**: MP does light rare earths (Nd, Pr). [[Dysprosium]] (the critical heavy REE) still comes from [[China]]. This limits how much supply chain risk MP can actually address.

## Scale reality

**MP vs [[China]] (CSIS analysis):**

| Metric | MP Materials | [[China]] |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| 2025 NdFeB magnet output | ~1,000 metric tons | 100,000+ tons (2018) |
| MP share of [[China]] 2018 | **<1%** | — |
| If MP scales 10x | 10,000 tons | — |
| 10x MP share of [[China]] | **~7%** | — |

**Gracelin Baskaran (CSIS):** "God just didn't give us those deposits, so we're very reliant on other countries."

**Reality check:** Even aggressive scaling leaves US far short of self-sufficiency.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Monopoly on US rare earth mining
- Apple anchor customer ($500M)
- DoD strategic priority
- Recycling technology differentiator
- [[China]] rare earth controls = tailwind

**Bear:**
- No heavy REE production
- Cost disadvantage vs [[China]]
- Small relative to global demand
- Execution risk on expansion
- Recycling economics unproven at scale
