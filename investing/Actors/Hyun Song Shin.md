- **Financial intermediation** — how banks amplify or dampen shocks
- **Global liquidity** — dollar funding conditions, cross-border flows

- **International commerce** — [[Global Value Chains]], trade finance, dollar invoicing
- **Digital innovation** — CBDCs, stablecoins, tokenization (via Innovation Hub)

## Key concepts

**Endogenous risk:** Market volatility isn't just external shocks — it's generated by participants' own behavior. When everyone de-risks simultaneously, fire sales create the very crash they're trying to avoid.

**Global dollar banking:** Even non-US banks depend heavily on USD funding. Dollar strength → tighter global credit conditions, regardless of local central bank policy.

**Dollar as credit supply (not just competitiveness):** Traditional view says strong dollar → cheaper imports. Shin shows strong dollar → tight dollar credit → [[Global Value Chains|GVCs]] contract. The credit channel dominates competitiveness, especially for trade between non-US countries.

## International commerce research

Shin's work reframes global trade as a **financial phenomenon**. Key insight: ~80% of trade finance is dollar-denominated, so GVC length depends on dollar credit conditions.

| Paper | Co-authors | Finding |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Theory of supply chains** (WP 1070, 2023) | Se-Jik Kim | GVC length = f(financing costs). Easy credit → longer chains; tight credit → reshoring |
| **Dollar and Exports** (WP 819, 2019) | Valentina Bruno | Exporters reliant on dollar credit suffer when dollar strengthens — opposite of textbook |
| **Exchange rates and working capital channel** (WP 694, 2018) | Bruno, Kim | Trade finance 80% USD. Strong dollar tightens this credit globally |
| **Dollar invoicing and GVCs** (WP 860, 2020) | Cook, Patel | Dollar appreciation hits direct bilateral trade harder than GVC trade serving US demand |
| **Mapping GVC realignment** (Bulletin 78, 2023) | Qiu, Zhang | Post-COVID supply chain restructuring patterns |

**Implication:** The broad dollar index is a proxy for global financial conditions. Fed policy transmits to world trade through the working capital channel, not just exchange rates.
