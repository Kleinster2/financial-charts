## Business model

Yotta operates hyperscale data centers and AI cloud infrastructure, positioned as India's sovereign alternative to global hyperscalers. Three revenue streams:

1. **Colocation** — rack space and power for enterprise/government clients
2. **AI-as-a-Service** — GPU compute rental (Nvidia DGX Cloud partner)
3. **Managed cloud** — hybrid cloud services for Indian enterprises

Half of the new 20,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs will be used by Nvidia itself over four years for its DGX AI cloud service, serving Indian IT giants like [[TCS]] and [[Infosys]]. The other half is for Yotta's own AI cloud customers.

## Nvidia partnership

Yotta is one of three key Nvidia partners for Indian AI infrastructure (alongside [[L&T]] and [[E2E Networks]]):

- **Phase 1:** 16,000 H100 GPUs (ordered mid-2024)
- **Phase 2:** 20,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs ($2B+, deploying by August 2026)
- New AI supercluster in Greater Noida (Delhi NCR), with additional capacity from Gujarat facility
- Part of India's IndiaAI Compute Pillar — national AI cloud buildout

Funding for the $2B GPU investment is fully secured. The $1–1.2B IPO raise is for broader expansion.

## Context

Yotta sits at the intersection of several structural trends:
- **India's AI infrastructure buildout** — $200B investment target across AI stack (Vaishnaw, Feb 2026)
- **US export controls reshaping chip flows** — companies deepening partnerships in India as alternative to China
- **Sovereign AI** — Indian government wants domestic compute capacity, not dependence on US hyperscalers
- **Data center boom** — India attracted ~$70B in data center/cloud investment from Microsoft, Google, Amazon

The IPO would make Yotta one of the first pure-play Indian AI infrastructure companies to go public.
