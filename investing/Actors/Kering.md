## Brand portfolio

| Brand | 2024 Revenue | YoY Change | Positioning |
|-------|--------------|------------|-------------|

| Revenue growth | +15% | -4% | -12% |
| Operating income (€B) | 5.6 | 4.7 | 2.5 |

## Leadership changes (2025)

| Role | Name | Effective |
|------|------|-----------|
| Gucci CEO | Stefano Cantino | Jan 2025 |
| Gucci Creative Director | **Demna** (from Balenciaga) | Feb 2025 |
| Saint Laurent CEO | Cédric Charbit | Jan 2025 |
| Balenciaga CEO | Gianfranco Gianangeli | Jan 2025 |

**Demna at Gucci** is the big bet — his first collection expected late 2025. Brought from Balenciaga to revive Gucci's cultural relevance.

## Real estate strategy

Kering is buying rather than leasing prime retail locations — a shift toward owned real estate as strategic moat.

| Property | Location | Price | Year |
|----------|----------|-------|------|
| **715 Fifth Ave** | NYC (56th St) | **$963M** | Jan 2024 |
| Milan flagship | Via Montenapoleone | Undisclosed | 2023 |

**Thesis:** Own flagship locations to control brand experience, avoid lease renewals, and hold appreciating real estate on balance sheet.

See [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] for context on luxury brand buying spree.

## Regional performance (2024)

| Region | YoY Change |
|--------|------------|
| Asia-Pacific | -24% |
| North America | -11% |
| Western Europe | -9% |
| Japan | +9% |
| Rest of world | +3% |

**China weakness** is the biggest drag — Asia-Pacific down 24% as Chinese luxury demand collapsed.

---

## Investment implications

**Bear case:**
- Gucci turnaround unproven; Demna is a risk
- China luxury demand may not recover
- Operating margins compressed (27% → 15%)
- [[LVMH]] taking market share

**Bull case:**
- Demna could revive Gucci like he did Balenciaga
- Bottega Veneta momentum proves portfolio depth
- Owned real estate appreciating
- Valuation compressed vs. historical
