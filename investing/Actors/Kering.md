## Price performance

## Brand portfolio

| Brand | 2024 Revenue | YoY Change | Status |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **[[Gucci]]** | €7.65B | **-23%** | Turnaround, Demna appointed |
| **[[Saint Laurent]]** | ~€3B | -13% | #2 brand, stable |
| **Bottega Veneta** | ~€1.7B | +4% | Outperformer |
| **Balenciaga** | ~€1.5B | Declining | Lost Demna |
| Other (Brioni, McQueen, jewelry) | ~€3B | Mixed | Smaller houses |

**[[Gucci]] is the problem:** 45% of group revenue, 51% operating income decline. The brand lost cultural relevance post-Alessandro Michele era.

## Leadership changes (2025)

| Role | Name | Effective |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Group CEO** | **Luca de Meo** | Sep 2025 |
| [[Gucci]] CEO | Stefano Cantino | Jan 2025 |
| [[Gucci]] Creative Director | **Demna** | Jul 2025 |
| [[Saint Laurent]] CEO | Cédric Charbit | Jan 2025 |
| Balenciaga CEO | Gianfranco Gianangeli | Jan 2025 |

**Demna at [[Gucci]]** is the big bet — brought from Balenciaga to revive Gucci's cultural relevance. First collection expected late 2025/early 2026.

**Luca de Meo** (ex-Renault CEO) appointed Group CEO, with [[François-Henri Pinault]] retaining chairmanship.

## [[Valentino]] investment

Kering owns 30% of [[Valentino]], with options to acquire the remaining 70% from [[Mayhoola]] (Qatar).

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Stake acquired | 30% (Jul 2023) |
| Price paid | **€1.7B** |
| Implied EV | €5.7B |
| Remaining 70% | Mayhoola put options 2028-29 |
| Kering call | 2029 |
| Estimated 70% price | Originally ~€4B, now "substantially below" |

**The liability:** If Mayhoola exercises put options, Kering must buy the remaining 70%. With Valentino's EBITDA collapsed from €337M (2022) to €246M (2024), the formula points to a lower price — but still a multi-billion euro obligation on top of Kering's existing €10.5B net debt.

**Strategic bind:** Can't walk away from €1.7B sunk cost, but full acquisition strains an already leveraged balance sheet.

---

## Real estate strategy

Kering is buying rather than leasing prime retail locations.

| Property | Location | Price | Year |
|----------|----------|-------|------|
| **715 Fifth Ave** | NYC (56th St) | **$963M** | Jan 2024 |
| Milan flagship | Via Montenapoleone | Undisclosed | 2023 |

See [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] for context on luxury brand buying spree.

## Regional performance (2024)

| Region | YoY Change |
|--------|------------|
| [[Asia]]-Pacific | -24% |
| North America | -11% |
| Western [[Europe]] | -9% |
| [[Japan]] | +9% |
| Rest of world | +3% |

**[[China]] weakness** is the biggest drag.

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- [[Gucci]] turnaround unproven; Demna is a risk
- [[China]] luxury demand may not recover
- Operating margins compressed (27% → 15% → 6%)
- [[LVMH]] taking market share
- [[Valentino]] liability looming

**Bull:**
- Demna could revive [[Gucci]] like he did Balenciaga
- Bottega Veneta momentum proves portfolio depth
- Owned real estate appreciating
- Valuation collapsed (trading at 10-year lows)
- Luca de Meo brings fresh perspective
