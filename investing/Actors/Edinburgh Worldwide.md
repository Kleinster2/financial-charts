## Saba Capital campaign

[[Saba Capital]] holds 30% of EWI. Three votes:

1. Feb 2025: Saba requisitioned meeting to replace board. 98.4% of non-Saba votes rejected. Cost to trust: undisclosed.
2. Jan 20, 2026: Saba tried to remove all 6 directors and appoint 3 nominees (Gliksberg, Joseph, Trenkow). 53.2% of total votes backed the board (92.7% excluding Saba's own shares). 70%+ turnout.
3. Feb 2026 (pending AGM): Saba proposed new resolutions with sweetener — if nominees win, all shareholders get 100% cash exit at 99% of NAV. ISS backed the EWI board.

EWI-[[Baillie Gifford US Growth|USA]] merger proposed (would have offered 40% exit) — Saba blocked it (Dec 2025).
