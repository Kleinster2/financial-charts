*vs [[Dell|DELL]], [[Cisco|CSCO]]*

![[hpe-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue dropped 2016-17 (services divestiture to [[DXC Technology|DXC]]), stabilized ~$28-30B, now growing with Juniper. Net income volatile.*

## Why HPE matters

Enterprise hardware/infrastructure pure-play after aggressive divestitures:

- **HP split (2015)**: Enterprise tech separated from PCs/printers ([[HP Inc]])
- **Services exit**: Spun [[HPE Enterprise Services]] → [[DXC Technology]] (2017)
- **Software exit**: Merged software assets with [[Micro Focus]] ($8.8B, 2017)
- **Juniper deal**: Acquired [[Juniper Networks]] for $14B (Jul 2025) — networking expansion
