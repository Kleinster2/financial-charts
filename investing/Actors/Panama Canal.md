**Panama Canal** — Critical global shipping chokepoint. Chinese port operations raising Monroe Doctrine concerns. Potential US pressure point.

## Why Panama Canal matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global trade | ~5% of world maritime trade |
| US trade | ~40% of US container traffic |
| Annual transits | ~14,000 ships |
| Revenue | ~$4B/year |

## Chinese presence

**Hutchison Ports (CK Hutchison):**
- Operates ports on both canal ends
- Balboa (Pacific) and Cristobal (Atlantic)
- 25-year concession (renewed)
- Hong Kong-based, China-linked

**US concerns:**
- Strategic chokepoint controlled by China-linked firm
- Intelligence gathering potential
- Leverage over US trade flows
- Monroe Doctrine violation (foreign control in hemisphere)

## Trump administration focus

**Statements:**
- Called Chinese presence "unacceptable"
- Threatened to "take back" canal
- Demanded Panama reduce Chinese influence

**Possible actions:**
- Pressure Panama to revoke concessions
- Sanctions on Hutchison operations
- US company replacement

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Winners | Losers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Status quo | Hutchison, shipping lines | — |
| US pressure | US port operators, Panama alternatives | Hutchison, China shipping |
| Expansion | Construction companies | — |

**US port operators:** Could benefit if Hutchison pushed out.

**Shipping reroutes:** If canal disrupted, benefits alternative routes (Suez, US rail).

## Water crisis (2023-2024)

**Drought impact:**
- Reduced transits due to low water
- Ships rerouted around South America
- Highlighted infrastructure vulnerability
- Expansion projects under discussion
