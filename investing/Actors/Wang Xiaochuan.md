## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (Baichuan is private).

**Indirect relevance:**
- Open weights pressure on closed model pricing
- If Baichuan succeeds, validates open approach
- Watch for IPO (likely HK)

**Thesis implications:**
- [[China]] has multiple AI model strategies (not just closed)
- Open weights may dominate for many use cases
- Tsinghua network produces serial entrepreneurs
