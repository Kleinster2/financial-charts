## Post-Humira pivot

| Year | Humira Status | Skyrizi/Rinvoq |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 2002 | Abbott Labs launches Humira | — |
| 2013 | AbbVie spun off (Humira = **63% of revenue**) | — |
| 2016 | Composition of matter patent expires (Dec) | — |
| 2022 | **$21.2B peak** | Growing |
| 2024 | Biosimilar competition finally arrives | $25B+ combined |
| 2025 | <$4B run-rate | **$25B+** combined |
| 2026E | Collapsed | **$31B** combined |
| 2030E | — | **$50B** combined |

**How AbbVie bought time:** What expired in 2016 was only the composition of matter patent. AbbVie had built a **patent thicket** — manufacturing methods, formulations, delivery. And since Humira is a biologic made in living cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells), copying it is technically difficult. Real competition didn't arrive until **8 years** after the main patent expired.

**The payoff:** Surplus cash flow from extended Humira exclusivity funded Skyrizi and Rinvoq development. Humira sales were $5B higher in 2016 than the market had expected, and kept growing to $21.2B in 2022.

**Success story:** Only 20% of Humira patients moved to biosimilars — many converted to Skyrizi/Rinvoq.
