**Chinese teapot refineries** — Independent (non-state) Chinese refineries, concentrated in Shandong province. Primary buyers of sanctioned Iranian and Russian oil. Iran's "economic lifeline."

---

## What are teapots

Private Chinese refineries operating outside the state-owned system ([[Sinopec]], [[CNPC]], [[CNOOC]]). Called "teapots" because they were originally small-scale — now some are massive.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Share of China refining capacity | ~25% |
| Location | Mostly Shandong province |
| Number of refineries | ~40 with import quotas |
| Key product | Refined fuels for domestic market |

---

## Why teapots matter

**They're the demand side of sanctions evasion.**

| Sanctioned supplier | Teapot role |
|---------------------|-------------|
| [[Iran]] | Primary buyer — "economic lifeline" |
| [[Russia]] | Major buyer of discounted Urals crude |
| [[Venezuela]] | Some purchases |

**Iranian oil = ~15% of China's total oil imports** — almost entirely through teapots.

---

## How the system works

```
Iran/Russia exports oil
    → Shadow fleet transports
        → Ship-to-ship transfer near Malaysia
            → Relabeled as "Malaysian" or "Indonesian"
                → Teapot refinery in Shandong buys
                    → Refined into domestic fuel
```

**Why teapots do it:**
- Sanctioned oil sells at $10-20/barrel discount
- Higher margins than buying Brent-priced crude
- Government tacitly allows it via quota system

---

## Quota system

Beijing controls teapot imports through quota allocations:

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Allocator | Ministry of Commerce |
| Frequency | Tranches throughout year |
| 2025 allocation | ~7-8M tons to ~20 teapots per tranche |
| 2026 total | 257M metric tons (non-state firms), unchanged from 2025 |
| Exhaustion risk | Teapots stop buying when quota runs out |

**2026 quota structure:** First two batches expected to cover ~70% of yearly allocation. In 2025, the first two batches accounted for each refiner's full-year allocation.

**Fall 2025 bottleneck:** Many teapots exhausted quotas by Oct-Nov, stopped buying Iranian crude → 52M barrels stuck in floating storage → Iran's USD inflows collapsed → rial accelerated decline.

---

## US sanctions on teapots (2025)

**Historic escalation:** US began directly sanctioning Chinese refineries for first time.

| Date | Refinery | Violation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Mar 2025 | **Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical** | ~$500M Iranian oil purchases |
| Apr 2025 | **Shandong Shengxing Chemical** | $1B+ Iranian crude, including from IRGC-QF front company |
| May 2025 | **Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group** | Iranian oil purchases |

**Impact:**
- Five Shandong refineries stopped buying Iranian crude in April 2025
- Others continued but with more caution
- Non-sanctioned tankers joined trade to reduce exposure

> "Teapot refineries are the largest purchasers of Iranian oil, providing the Islamic [[Republic]] its primary economic lifeline." — Treasury Secretary Bessent

## Operating rates

| Period | Capacity utilization |
|--------|---------------------|
| Feb 2025 | <45% (lowest in 2+ years) |
| Mar 2025 | 46% (slight recovery) |
| Late 2025 | Subdued, weak margins |

Of 49 independent refineries in Shandong, only 27 were operational as of early 2025 — the rest idled without access to domestic crude production.

**Drivers of low utilization:**
- US sanctions disrupting supply
- Weak domestic fuel demand (China slowdown)
- Quota constraints
- Margin compression
- Since Jan 2025, Beijing allows only 40-80% consumption tax offset on fuel oil imports (vs. 100% prior), adding ~$2/bbl to import costs
- EV adoption and LNG-powered trucks eating into transportation fuel demand

## Comeback and consolidation (mid-2025)

Despite the headwinds, bankrupt teapots are being acquired and restarted under new ownership:

| Refinery | Buyer | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Shandong Changyi Petrochemical (ex-[[Sinochem]]) | Weifang Hongrun Petrochemical | **Resumed operations** on domestic crude |
| Zhenghe Group | In talks with buyers | Bankrupt, pending acquisition |
| Shandong Huaxing Petrochemical Group | In talks with buyers | Bankrupt, pending acquisition |

All three are applying for government import quotas — combined ask of up to ~300K bpd.

**Central vs. local government tension:** Beijing wants to consolidate — shuttering small plants to clear the way for a large-scale private refining and petrochemical complex on Yulong Island. But Shandong provincial government is actively supporting teapot survival as an economic driver, even increasing consumption tax rebates for six local refiners. Advanced liquids-to-chemicals complexes in neighboring provinces are eroding Shandong's competitiveness, adding urgency to the provincial pushback.

---

## Supply diversification

[[Rystad Energy]] suggests teapots may pivot from [[Iran]]ian crude toward [[Russia]], Brazil, or Middle Eastern suppliers if sanctions make Iranian oil costlier. Alternatively, they reduce runs further. China's crude imports hit a record 11.6M bpd in 2025 as low prices and geopolitical tensions spurred stockpile building.

## Key refineries

| Refinery | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Shandong Shouguang Luqing | Shandong | **Sanctioned** (Mar 2025) |
| Shandong Shengxing Chemical | Shandong | **Sanctioned** (Apr 2025) |
| Hebei Xinhai Chemical | Hebei | **Sanctioned** (May 2025) |
| Dongming Petrochemical | Shandong | Active, large |
| Hengli Petrochemical | Liaoning | Active, integrated |
| Shandong Changyi Petrochemical | Shandong | Restarted (mid-2025), new ownership |

---

## Investment implications

| Angle | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Iran revenue** | Teapot buying = Iran gets paid; teapot stop = Iran crisis |
| **[[Oil]] prices** | Teapots absorbing sanctioned supply keeps prices lower |
| **China fuel margins** | Teapot health affects domestic refining margins |
| **Sanctions risk** | More teapots likely to be designated |

### Indirect exposure

| Company | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| Chinese refiners ([[Sinopec]], PetroChina) | Compete with teapots domestically |
| Tanker companies | Shadow fleet serves teapots |
| Iranian economy | Teapot demand = Iran's lifeline |
