**Chinese teapot refineries** — Independent (non-state) Chinese refineries, concentrated in Shandong province. Primary buyers of sanctioned Iranian and Russian oil. Iran's "economic lifeline."

---

## What are teapots

Private Chinese refineries operating outside the state-owned system ([[Sinopec]], PetroChina, [[CNOOC]]). Called "teapots" because they were originally small-scale — now some are massive.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Share of China refining capacity | ~25% |
| Location | Mostly Shandong province |
| Number of refineries | ~40 with import quotas |
| Key product | Refined fuels for domestic market |

## Why teapots matter

**They're the demand side of sanctions evasion.**

| Sanctioned supplier | Teapot role |
|---------------------|-------------|
| [[Iran]] | Primary buyer — "economic lifeline" |
| [[Russia]] | Major buyer of discounted Urals crude |
| [[Venezuela]] | Some purchases |

**Iranian oil = ~15% of China's total oil imports** — almost entirely through teapots.

## How the system works

```
Iran/Russia exports oil
    → Shadow fleet transports
        → Ship-to-ship transfer near Malaysia
            → Relabeled as "Malaysian" or "Indonesian"
                → Teapot refinery in Shandong buys
                    → Refined into domestic fuel
```

**Why teapots do it:**
- Sanctioned oil sells at $10-20/barrel discount
- Higher margins than buying Brent-priced crude
- Government tacitly allows it via quota system

---

## Quota system

Beijing controls teapot imports through quota allocations:

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Allocator | Ministry of Commerce |
| Frequency | Tranches throughout year |
| 2025 allocation | ~7-8M tons to ~20 teapots per tranche |
| Exhaustion risk | Teapots stop buying when quota runs out |

**Fall 2025 bottleneck:** Many teapots exhausted quotas by Oct-Nov, stopped buying Iranian crude → 52M barrels stuck in floating storage → Iran's USD inflows collapsed → rial accelerated decline.

---

## US sanctions on teapots (2025)

**Historic escalation:** US began directly sanctioning Chinese refineries for first time.

| Date | Refinery | Violation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Mar 2025 | **Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical** | ~$500M Iranian oil purchases |
| Apr 2025 | **Shandong Shengxing Chemical** | $1B+ Iranian crude, including from IRGC-QF front company |
| May 2025 | **Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group** | Iranian oil purchases |

**Impact:**
- Five Shandong refineries stopped buying Iranian crude in April 2025
- Others continued but with more caution
- Non-sanctioned tankers joined trade to reduce exposure

> "Teapot refineries are the largest purchasers of Iranian oil, providing the Islamic [[Republic]] its primary economic lifeline." — Treasury Secretary Bessent

## Operating rates

| Period | Capacity utilization |
|--------|---------------------|
| Feb 2025 | <45% (lowest in 2+ years) |
| Mar 2025 | 46% (slight recovery) |
| Late 2025 | Subdued, weak margins |

**Drivers of low utilization:**
- US sanctions disrupting supply
- Weak domestic fuel demand (China slowdown)
- Quota constraints
- Margin compression

## Key refineries

| Refinery | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Shandong Shouguang Luqing | Shandong | **Sanctioned** (Mar 2025) |
| Shandong Shengxing Chemical | Shandong | **Sanctioned** (Apr 2025) |
| Hebei Xinhai Chemical | Hebei | **Sanctioned** (May 2025) |
| Dongming Petrochemical | Shandong | Active, large |
| Hengli Petrochemical | Liaoning | Active, integrated |

## Investment implications

| Angle | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Iran revenue** | Teapot buying = Iran gets paid; teapot stop = Iran crisis |
| **[[Oil]] prices** | Teapots absorbing sanctioned supply keeps prices lower |
| **China fuel margins** | Teapot health affects domestic refining margins |
| **Sanctions risk** | More teapots likely to be designated |

### Indirect exposure

| Company | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| Chinese refiners ([[Sinopec]], PetroChina) | Compete with teapots domestically |
| Tanker companies | Shadow fleet serves teapots |
| Iranian economy | Teapot demand = Iran's lifeline |
