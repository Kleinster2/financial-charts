## Alphabet century bond warning (Feb 2026)

Drew parallel between Alphabet's planned 100-year sterling bond and [[Motorola]]'s 1997 century bond:

- In 1997, Motorola was a top-25 US company by market cap and revenue, with America's most valuable brand
- By 1998, [[Nokia]] overtook Motorola in cellular; after [[Apple|iPhone]], Motorola faded to 232nd by market cap (~$11B revenue)
- Broader thesis: century bonds imply permanence, but tech dominance is fragile

Part of his wider skepticism toward AI infrastructure spending — has bet against [[NVIDIA]] and questioned hyperscaler accounting.
