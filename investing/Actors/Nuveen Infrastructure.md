## Clean energy M&A outlook (Jan 2026)

**Joost Bergsma:** "Slowly we're starting to see a little bit more confidence, and also the exit market starts to be a bit more fluid in the clean energy space."

**Exit challenges (past 2 years):**
- Tried to exit European fund assets
- Buyers "keeping their powder dry"
- Not asset quality issue — market timing

**Current activity:**
- In talks for wind asset deals in [[Europe]]
- Market fluidity improving

## Market context

**2025 clean energy M&A:**
- Sector slumped to lowest since 2017 (55.3 GW)
- Average deal premium: 12% (down from 46% in 2024)
- Overall M&A hit $4.5T (2nd best on record) — renewables missed out

**2026 revival drivers:**
- Sellers lowering price expectations
- Data center demand supporting renewables
- Less policy uncertainty (US safe-harbor rules preserved)
- [[IEA]] forecasts renewables fastest-growing source through 2035
