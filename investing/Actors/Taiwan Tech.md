## Why [[Taiwan]] matters

Semiconductor superpower:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | 24 million |
| Foundry share | ~65% global |
| Advanced nodes | ~90% global |
| GDP from chips | ~15% |

World's most critical semiconductor location.

## TSMC dominance

**Global foundry leader:**

| Metric | TSMC |
|--------|------|
| Foundry share | ~55%+ |
| Advanced share | ~90% |
| Customers | Apple, NVIDIA, [[AMD]], [[Qualcomm]] |
| Tech lead | 3nm, 2nm next |

Most important company for AI chips.

## Semiconductor ecosystem

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[TSMC]] | Foundry |
| [[MediaTek]] | IC design |
| [[ASE]] | Packaging/test |
| [[UMC]] | Mature foundry |
| [[Novatek]] | Display ICs |
| Realtek | Connectivity ICs |

Complete semiconductor supply chain.

## [[Advanced packaging]]

**CoWoS leadership:**
- TSMC CoWoS
- Critical for AI chips
- Capacity constrained
- NVIDIA dependent

CoWoS = major bottleneck.

---

## Geopolitical risk

**[[Taiwan]] Strait:**
- [[China]] claims [[Taiwan]]
- US defense commitment
- TSMC concentration risk
- "Silicon Shield" theory

Geopolitical flashpoint.

## Diversification efforts

**TSMC global fabs:**

| Location | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Arizona | Building |
| [[Japan]] | Building |
| [[Germany]] | Announced |
| [[Taiwan]] | Core |

De-risking but [[Taiwan]] still dominant.

## Government role

| Factor | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| ITRI | Research institute |
| Industrial policy | Semiconductor focus |
| Subsidies | Fab investment support |
| [[Defense]] | US partnership |

---

## vs South Korea

| Factor | [[Taiwan]] | Korea |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Foundry | Dominant | #2 |
| Memory | Minor | Dominant |
| Packaging | Leading | Developing |
| Geopolitical risk | Higher | Lower |

Complementary semiconductor powers.

## Investment implications

**Direct exposure:**
- TSMC (TSM)
- MediaTek
- ASE (ASX)
- [[UMC]] ([[UMC]])

**Indirect exposure:**
- Every AI company depends on [[Taiwan]]
