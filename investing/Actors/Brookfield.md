## Why Brookfield matters

Brookfield is one of world's largest infrastructure investors:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $900B+ |
| Structure | Brookfield Corp (BN) + Brookfield Asset Mgmt (BAM) |
| Focus | Infrastructure, real estate, renewables, PE |
| Data center exposure | Growing but not primary focus |

---

## Data center strategy

**Approach:**
- Infrastructure lens (power, connectivity)
- Data centers as subset of digital infra
- Less concentrated than [[Blue Owl]] or [[Blackstone]]
- Global footprint

**Recent moves:**
- Increased DC investment
- Focus on powered shell / build-to-suit
- Renewable energy integration (own assets)

---

## Renewable energy advantage

Brookfield owns massive renewable energy portfolio:
- Hydro, wind, solar assets
- Can bundle power + data center
- Addresses [[Power constraints]]
- Differentiated from pure financial buyers

---

## Westinghouse acquisition

Brookfield + [[Cameco]] acquired Westinghouse (2023):
- Nuclear services and fuel
- Links to [[Nuclear power for AI]] thesis
- Vertical integration into power

## Competitive position

| Firm | AUM | DC focus | Differentiation |
|------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| [[Blackstone]] | $1T+ | QTS platform | Own/operate |
| [[Blue Owl]] | $273B | Pure DC finance | JV model |
| **Brookfield** | $900B+ | Part of infra | Renewables integration |
| [[DigitalBridge]] | $80B+ | Pure-play digital | Specialized |

Brookfield is generalist infrastructure; others more DC-focused.
