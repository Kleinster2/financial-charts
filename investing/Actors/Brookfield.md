**Brookfield** — Global infrastructure giant. $900B+ AUM. Data centers part of broader portfolio.

---

## Why Brookfield matters

Brookfield is one of world's largest infrastructure investors:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $900B+ |
| Structure | Brookfield Corp (BN) + Brookfield Asset Mgmt (BAM) |
| Focus | Infrastructure, real estate, renewables, PE |
| Data center exposure | Growing but not primary focus |

---

## Data center strategy

**Approach:**
- Infrastructure lens (power, connectivity)
- Data centers as subset of digital infra
- Less concentrated than [[Blue Owl]] or [[Blackstone]]
- Global footprint

**Recent moves:**
- Increased DC investment
- Focus on powered shell / build-to-suit
- Renewable energy integration (own assets)

---

## Renewable energy advantage

Brookfield owns massive renewable energy portfolio:
- Hydro, wind, solar assets
- Can bundle power + data center
- Addresses [[Power constraints]]
- Differentiated from pure financial buyers

**Global energy transition strategy:** $20B raised (2024)

**[[Asia]] Pacific expansion (Nov 2025):**

| Deal | Location | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| Alba Renewables Pte | Philippines, Thailand | Acquisition |
| Wind project | Vietnam | New investment |

**Daniel Cheng (Head of Renewable Power, [[Asia]] Pacific):** "There's a very clear and mature market for investors to buy these operational assets that are long-term contracted."

## Clean energy M&A outlook (Jan 2026)

**Brookfield sees M&A revival:**
- Asset owners lowering price expectations
- Buyers willing to pay for clean energy capacity
- Data center demand supporting renewables
- Less policy/tariff/rate uncertainty than 2025

**2025 context:**
- Clean energy M&A slumped to lowest since 2017 (55.3 GW)
- Average deal premium: 12% (down from 46% in 2024)
- Overall M&A hit $4.5T (2nd best on record) — renewables missed out

**Valuation reset (S&P Clean Energy Transition Index forward P/E):**

| Period | P/E |
|--------|-----|
| 2020 peak | ~50x (bubble) |
| 2024 trough | ~12x |
| Current | ~20x (recovering) |

**Brookfield positioned:** Operational assets with credible offtake preferred over development-stage projects.

## [[Westinghouse]] acquisition

Brookfield + [[Cameco]] acquired [[Westinghouse]] (2023):
- Nuclear services and fuel
- Links to [[Nuclear power for AI]] thesis
- Vertical integration into power

---

## Competitive position

| Firm | AUM | DC focus | Differentiation |
|------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| [[Blackstone]] | $1T+ | [[QTS]] platform | Own/operate |
| [[Blue Owl]] | $273B | Pure DC finance | JV model |
| **Brookfield** | $900B+ | Part of infra | Renewables integration |
| [[DigitalBridge]] | $80B+ | Pure-play digital | Specialized |

Brookfield is generalist infrastructure; others more DC-focused.

## Q4/FY 2025 results (Feb 12, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Net income (to shareholders) | $743M | $1.3B |
| DE before realizations | $1.5B ($0.63/sh) | $5.4B ($2.27/sh, +11%) |
| Total DE | $1.6B ($0.67/sh) | $6.0B ($2.54/sh) |
| Fee-bearing capital | — | $603B (+12%) |
| Fee-related earnings | — | $3.0B (+22%) |
| Capital raised | — | $112B |
| Monetizations | — | $91B |
| Deployable capital | — | $188B (record) |
| Dividend increase | +17% to $0.28/yr | — |
| Share buybacks | — | $1B+ at avg $36/sh |
| Unrealized carried interest | — | $11.6B |

Wealth Solutions: DE $1.7B, annuity sales $20B, insurance assets $143B.

Key: Launched **inaugural AI infrastructure fund** in 2025. With $188B deployable capital and $603B fee-bearing capital, Brookfield is a major allocator to AI buildout. Validates [[ALTM]] thesis — alt managers are capital deployers benefiting from AI infrastructure demand, not intermediaries being disrupted.

## Feb 24, 2026: Ori acquisition → Radiant launch

Acquired UK cloud-computing firm **[[Radiant (Brookfield)|Ori Industries]]** (backed by [[Saudi Aramco]] Ventures), merged it into **[[Radiant (Brookfield)|Radiant]]** — a new GPU-as-a-service company.

- **Model:** Take-or-pay GPU leasing to investment-grade customers across ~5-year chip life
- **GPU supplier:** [[NVIDIA]] (including forthcoming [[Rubin]] chips)
- **Target:** Sovereign cloud, Europe initially, Middle East expansion
- **AI capex thesis:** Brookfield estimates $7T total AI investment needed, $3T for compute
- **Fund context:** First deployment from AI infrastructure fund (seeking $10B commitments, up to $100B with leverage)
- Also investing up to **$5B in [[Bloom Energy]]** (fuel cells for data centers)

Sikander Rashid (Head of AI Infrastructure): "I think of it as a leasing business."

See [[Radiant (Brookfield)]] for full details.

## Strategic analysis: The AI infrastructure financier

### The full-stack thesis

Brookfield is the **only major alt manager that owns every layer** of the AI infrastructure stack:

| Layer | Brookfield asset | Competitor gap |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Capital** | $188B deployable, $100B AI program | [[Blackstone]] has scale but not power assets |
| **Power generation** | Owns hydro, wind, solar globally | [[Blue Owl]]/[[DigitalBridge]] don't own generation |
| **Power innovation** | $5B [[Bloom Energy]] fuel cells | Bypasses 3-5 year grid connection waits |
| **Nuclear** | [[Westinghouse]] (with [[Cameco]]) | Unique nuclear exposure for baseload |
| **Data centers** | DC operator investments | Generalist, not pure-play |
| **GPUs/Compute** | [[Radiant (Brookfield)|Radiant]] (GPU-as-a-service) | First alt manager to own this layer |
| **Software** | Ori platform (orchestration, inference, K8s) | Most infra investors have zero software |

No other infrastructure investor can bundle power + space + compute + software in a single contract. This is Brookfield's bet: that the AI buildout needs an **infrastructure intermediary**, not just cloud providers.

### Bull case

- **$7T AI capex** thesis validated by [[Meta]] ($135B/yr), [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon]] spending acceleration
- **Sovereign AI** is a real demand driver — every nation wants domestic compute, creating recurring global demand
- **Low cost of capital** vs. GPU cloud startups — Brookfield raises infrastructure-grade capital at much lower rates than [[CoreWeave]]'s $7.5B+ debt
- **NVIDIA alignment** — NVIDIA is both fund investor and supplier, creating mutual incentive (similar to [[commercial warrants]] logic)
- **Power scarcity** is the real AI bottleneck — Brookfield's renewable portfolio becomes its deepest moat as data centers compete for grid access
- **Take-or-pay contracts** eliminate demand risk — investment-grade counterparties locked in for ~5 years

### Bear case

- **GPU obsolescence risk** — 5-year chip life assumption may be too long; 2-3 year cycles could leave stranded assets
- **"We will not take technology risk"** is aspirational — if customer defaults or demand shifts to new architectures, contracts may not hold
- **Sovereign cloud may stay niche** — governments are slow procurers and politically unpredictable
- **Execution complexity** — bundling six layers across multiple countries is exponentially harder than any single layer
- **NVIDIA concentration** — single supplier dependency; allocation crunches favor hyperscalers over Brookfield
- **Valuation already reflects AI thesis** — BAM/BN have rallied; how much AI premium is already priced in?

### The historical analogy

Brookfield is attempting what **J.P. Morgan did for railroads** and **infrastructure funds did for telecom**: provide the financial intermediation layer that makes a massive capital-intensive buildout possible. The AI buildout ($7T over a decade) is too large for tech companies to fund from cash flow alone. Someone has to intermediate between long-term capital (pension funds, sovereign wealth) and short-term infrastructure needs (GPUs, power, data centers). Brookfield is betting that "someone" is them.
