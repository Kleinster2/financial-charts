## Business model

Altruist is vertically integrated: custodian + software + AI.

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Custody | Clearing, account opening, trading, settlement |
| Software | Portfolio management, rebalancing, tax management, fee billing, reporting |
| AI (Hazel) | Meeting prep, client communication, tax planning, document analysis |

Traditional custodians (Schwab, Fidelity) provide custody and basic tools. Advisors buy software separately from vendors. Altruist bundles everything, then layers AI on top — making the standalone software vendors redundant.

## CEO Bloomberg interview (Feb 12 2026)

Jason Wenk appeared on Bloomberg Tech after the Hazel tax planning launch (Feb 10) triggered a wealth management selloff:

| Stock | Move (Feb 10-11) |
|-------|-----------------|
| [[LPL Financial]] | -8.3% |
| [[Charles Schwab]] | -7.4% |
| [[Raymond James]] | -8.8% |

Key quotes:
- "No one could have thought that somewhere between tens of billions to maybe $100 billion of market cap would be wiped out in a week"
- Altruist is **not** looking to replace wealth managers — AI is "an incredible equalizer"
- Tax planning is "just the start" — more agents coming
- Hundreds of large wealth management firms reached out in 48 hours to explore partnerships
- Hazel available to any independent advisor regardless of custodian — deliberately separated from Altruist's custodian business
- "It's more important that you are the platform and not just a feature"
