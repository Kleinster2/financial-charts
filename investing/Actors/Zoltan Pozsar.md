## Key theses & frameworks

### Shadow banking taxonomy
Created the definitive map of the [[shadow banking]] system while at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|NY Fed]]. This visualization became the standard reference for regulators worldwide and catalyzed [[G20]] reform efforts. Showed how money market funds, repo, securities lending, and asset-backed commercial paper created a parallel banking system outside traditional regulation.

### Repo market plumbing
Pozsar's deep understanding of reserve distribution and repo mechanics led him to correctly predict the September 2019 repo market blowup, where overnight rates spiked to 10%. He argued the [[Federal Reserve|Fed's]] quantitative tightening had drained reserves below comfortable levels for large banks, creating a liquidity crunch in overnight funding markets.

### Bretton Woods III
Published in March 2022 after [[Russia]]'s invasion of [[Ukraine]] and the freezing of Russian [[central bank]] reserves. Core thesis: the weaponization of the [[U.S. dollar]] reserve system is accelerating a shift from a dollar-based monetary order ([[Bretton Woods]] II) to a commodity-backed order ([[Bretton Woods]] III). Key claims:
- [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[BRICS]] nations will increasingly settle trade in non-dollar currencies
- [[Gold]] and [[commodities]] will re-emerge as reserve assets
- The [[petrodollar]] system faces structural decline
- [[Inflation]] in the West will be structurally higher as commodity suppliers demand real assets over [[U.S. Treasuries]]

## Track record

### Hits
- 2019 repo crisis: Called the blowup months in advance when consensus dismissed the risk
- Shadow banking mapping: Became the definitive framework for understanding the 2008 financial crisis plumbing
- Post-COVID rate calls: Accurately mapped the [[Federal Reserve|Fed's]] emergency facilities and their implications
- Reserve scarcity framework: Correctly identified when the [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] was draining too many reserves

### Misses / debates
- Bretton Woods III timing: The dollar has remained resilient far longer than the thesis implied; de-dollarization has been slower than suggested
- Inflation persistence: Some of his more extreme inflation predictions tied to the commodity-reserve thesis haven't fully materialized
- Dollar demise: The structural dollar bull case (capital account flows, tech dominance) remains a strong counterargument

## Influence & style

Pozsar writes long, dense dispatches packed with balance sheet diagrams and flow-of-funds analysis. [[Adam Tooze]] called him the "Jules Verne of financial forecasting." His research notes at [[Credit Suisse]] were among the most widely read on [[Wall Street]], and the [[Financial Times]] noted he was the only financier with his own hashtag on social media. His work bridges central banking, geopolitics, and market microstructure in a way few others attempt.
