# Tokyo Stock Exchange

[[Japan]]'s primary stock exchange, part of Japan Exchange Group (JPX). 5,100+ listed companies, record ¥35T deal volume (2025). Under CEO [[Hiromi Yamaji]] (since 2021), launched aggressive [[Japan corporate governance revolution|governance reforms]] demanding companies below 1x P/B publish improvement plans. Created Prime Market tier with higher governance standards.

## Reform impact (2023-2026)

| Metric | Before reform | Current |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Companies below book value | >50% | Declining (majority now above) |
| Annual delistings | ~50 | 125 (2025); 16 announced already in 2026 |
| Carve-outs/spin-offs | Rare | 280 in H1 2025 (record) |
| Deal volume | — | ¥35T (2025, record) |
| Buybacks | Modest | Record levels |

Yamaji on the fundamental challenge: "To transform the mindset of the management — that's very important, and also probably the most challenging thing. PBR is just a financial indicator to gauge how much you progressed."

**Assessment method**: Annual analysis based on ~400 global investors (domestic and overseas). TSE is "not the entity to assess progress — global investors are."

**Government backing**: Every PM since [[Shinzo Abe]] (2015) has supported governance reform — [[Yoshihide Suga]], [[Fumio Kishida]], [[Shigeru Ishiba]], [[Sanae Takaichi]]. All "convinced that growth of the private sector is essential."

**Startup culture shift**: Since ~2015-16, ~1 in 3 new graduates are thinking about leaving their first company. Joining startups is now one of the most popular career choices for university students.

**AI adoption**: Japanese companies described as "quite receptive" to new technologies including AI. Still early stage, but companies actively exploring applications.
