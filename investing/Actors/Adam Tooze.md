## Key concept: Polycrisis

Tooze popularized the term "polycrisis" (originally coined by French theorist Edgar Morin in the 1970s) to describe the simultaneous, interconnected crises of the 2020s.

**The four pillars of polycrisis:**
1. Economics (financial instability, inequality)
2. Politics (democratic backsliding, populism)
3. Geopolitics (great power competition, war)
4. Environment (climate change blowing back)

"They don't reduce to a single common denominator... The polycrisis term has a real utility descriptively, because it's arm-waving. It's going, 'Look, there's a lot of stuff happening here all at once.'"

**Origin point:** Argues the current moment started in 2008—not just the financial crisis, but simultaneously Putin's aggression against Georgia, WTO Doha Round breakdown, and the prelude to Copenhagen climate disappointment.

**2025 reassessment:** In August 2025, Tooze revisited the concept, questioning whether "polycrisis" still describes the current moment or whether ideological drivers have become more overdetermining.

## LRB Lecture: Electrostate vs Petrostate (2025)

Inaugural London Review of Books lecture series. Tooze frames the global energy transition as a story of **electrostates** (societies consuming energy in electrical form) vs **petrostates**, with China and the US as archetypes.

### The "mid-transition" moment

Opens with a visceral scene in Chengdu: standing at a crosswalk, ~100 vehicles pass in 30 seconds without Tooze noticing—all electric, producing only tire noise. "Are you experiencing a moment of mid-transition?" The disorientation of being between two stable states.

**Mid-transition:** "The condition of being in the complex period of change between two more stable states—more commonly used in discussions about energy systems, gender transitions, and career changes."

The phenomenon is so disconcerting that EV manufacturers worldwide add fake engine noises. Yamaha patented a mock internal combustion engine for motorcycles whose sole function is generating sound and vibration.

### European green modernization: the failure

Europe was the laboratory where 1980s-90s social theory of "green modernity" was actually implemented:

| Innovation | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Feed-in tariffs | Created solar market, then surrendered it to China |
| Carbon pricing (ETS) | Took 15 years to work; unprepared for price signal shock |
| Nuclear phase-out (Germany, Italy) | Agonizingly extended coal protection instead |
| Diesel focus | Milked car industry for dividends; now demand protectionism |
| Strategic autonomy | Did nothing re: Russia or US dependence |

**The Eurozone crisis as inflection point:** European renewable investment peaked at $131B in 2011, then collapsed under austerity. Southern Europe (where solar made most sense) hit hardest. This is when China overtook.

**The Green Deal's influence:** When Xi Jinping announced China's net-zero commitment (UN General Assembly, fall 2020), the Tsinghua University team's PowerPoint slides explicitly cited the EU Green Deal as template. "The highest compliment in modern technocracy."

**But Europe drove decarbonization without electrification.** Top-left quadrant (green power, low electrification) vs China in top-right (green power + deep electrification).

### Why European theorists failed

The 1980s-90s theorists (Beck, Latour, et al.) who mapped green modernity:

1. **Underestimated power** — No coherent theory of how to bulldoze opposed interest groups
2. **No global geopolitics** — Unaware of the frame that sat comfortably around them
3. **Assumed American alliance** — "It would have been far better if the United States had been a reliable ally in the project of green modernization"

### US fossil backlash: front-footed, not rear-guard

Tooze rejects the standard narrative of climate backlash as Koch brothers / coal industry rear-guard action:

**Bird-Hagel Resolution (1997):** Unanimous Senate vote against Kyoto—*before* it was signed. Not climate deniers; the issue was **globalization**. Kyoto exempted China (climate justice), which the AFL-CIO and broad coalition saw as disastrous concession. "Weird how little this obvious connection to globalization struggles receives emphasis in the backlash literature."

**The Iraq Wars as hyper-agency:** Not rear-guard but "forward moving edges of efforts to seek control over the world." The Suskind quote: "We're an empire now. When we act, we create our own reality."

**Fracking as transformative innovation:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Shale gas | Fundamentally changed US electricity economics |
| QE / zero rates | "No one benefited more from that epic period of public intervention than the fossil block" |
| Gas vs oil | Gas stays domestic (pipelines), oil flows to global pool—gas remade US power generation |

"Fracking, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of the American electrostate in the 2010s."

Even Texas: coal squeezed out, replaced by LNG + wind (driven by cost, not green politics).

### China: not replication but new phase

**Scale of urbanization:**
- 800 million relocated to cities (1949-2019)
- 19 urban conurbations with 850 million inhabitants
- 90% of Chinese habitations built since 1990
- "Imagine erasing all of urban America and replacing it in a single generation"

**The dirtiest thing humanity has ever done:**

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Coal consumption | Three phases of human history: prehistory, Western industrialism, then China in one generation |
| Air pollution deaths | 1.4 million/year (early 2010s) vs ~500K in US over 30 years |
| Ultra-supercritical plants | China: vast majority; US: one |

"They knew it." The regime deliberately opted into this violent transformation, then pivoted hard. By mid-2010s, Chinese coal plant emissions standards exceeded US and EU.

**Xi Jinping's environmental pivot as regime survival:** "There's only so many times people can see their babies choking to death before you need to pivot."

**Manufacturing dominance (2024):**

| Product | China capacity | US comparison |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Solar panels | 1,200 GW/year production capacity | 250 GW total installed |

"China can increase America's total installed solar capacity five-fold in a single year."

### The IRA verdict

"Swiss Army knife politics"—a desperate emergency policy, dancing in a telephone booth.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Scale | Needed to be much bigger for real effect |
| Design | Highly functional given constraints |
| PR | "Head-turning, mind-blowing demonstration"—both US ("America will save the planet") and EU ("we're so abject, we need a state like theirs") |
| Durability | Failed to future-proof like ACA; didn't change enough of society |
| Post-Trump | "May have burnt the boats" on this approach |

### AI convergence in the Gulf

The "great historical coincidence": Trump's second term coincides with AI capex explosion.

**US power pipeline:** Almost entirely solar, wind, batteries. The structural shift predates Biden but is now overwhelming.

**Gulf solution:** US chips + Chinese solar panels meeting in Emirates/Saudi/Qatar. Gulf states are largest buyers of Chinese panels to power data centers for American AI.

Meanwhile: US Energy Department and Qatar lecture Europeans on climate regulations, leveraging gas dependence.

### Methodological heroes

Not "panda-hugging CCP groupies" but experts mapping Chinese investment flows globally:

- **Ember** (British think tank)
- **Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab**

"Equipping their counterparts in recipient countries—those who, contrary to Jake Sullivan, are going to be the consumers of Chinese technology—with the tools to haggle, to negotiate, to force the Chinese to terms."

On narrative framing: If comedy (things work out) requires knowing the ending, and tragedy requires certainty about doom, Tooze settles for **comedy where "ours is a bit part, not the starring role."**

## Analytical approach

**What makes Tooze distinctive:**

1. **Historical depth** — Every contemporary analysis grounded in historical precedent. 2008 crisis → 1930s parallels. COVID response → wartime fiscal mobilization.

2. **Data-forward** — Heavy use of charts, statistics, primary sources. Not punditry—evidence.

3. **Transatlantic lens** — Equally fluent in US, European, and German policy debates. Rare among English-language commentators.

4. **Structural focus** — Analyzes institutional architecture (central banks, trade regimes, fiscal capacity) rather than personalities or politics alone.

5. **Real-time history** — Writes about events as they unfold with the rigor usually applied retrospectively. *Shutdown* published in 2021 about events from 2020.

**Recurring themes:**
- Central bank independence as contested political terrain
- Climate transition as industrial policy battleground
- US hegemony's fiscal foundations
- Europe's incomplete monetary union
- China as systemic challenge, not just competitor
