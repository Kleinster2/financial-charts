**Russia** — Major oil/gas producer, geopolitical actor. Sanctioned by US/[[EU]]. Venezuela ally, China partner. Affects energy and semiconductor markets.

---

## Why Russia matters

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Oil/gas producer | ~10M bpd oil, major gas exporter |
| Sanctions target | Comprehensive US/[[EU]] sanctions since 2022 |
| China alliance | Energy sales, tech workarounds |
| Venezuela ally | Political/military support for Maduro |

---

## Energy position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Oil production | ~10M bpd |
| Gas production | Major ([[Europe]] dependent pre-2022) |
| Oil companies | [[Rosneft]], Gazprom, Lukoil |
| Export markets | China, [[India]] (discounted) |

**Post-2022:** [[Europe]] cut off Russian gas → pivot to [[Asia]].

---

## Sanctions impact

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Oil price cap | $60/barrel ceiling (leaky) |
| Gas | [[Europe]] largely off Russian gas |
| Technology | Cut off from Western chips/equipment |
| Finance | Removed from SWIFT (major banks) |
| [[Semiconductors]] | Cannot buy advanced chips |

See [[US Sanctions]], [[OFAC]] for policy details.

## Oil sanctions & secondary sanctions

### G7 price cap ($60/barrel)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Implemented | Dec 2022 |
| Cap | $60/barrel |
| Enforcement | Western shipping, insurance, finance |
| Effectiveness | Leaky — shadow fleet evades |

### Shadow fleet

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[EU]]-sanctioned vessels | ~600 (Dec 2025) |
| Share of Russian crude exports | ~27% via shadow fleet |
| Characteristics | Aging tankers, opaque ownership, non-Western insurance |

**2026 enforcement actions:**
- Jan 2: Finland seized freighter *Fitburg* (suspected cable sabotage)
- Jan 7: US Navy/Coast Guard seized tanker *Marinera* in North Atlantic
- Ukraine drone strikes on shadow fleet tankers *Virat*, *Kairos*, *Dashan* (Nov 2025)

### Secondary sanctions (Jan 2025)

| [[Target]] | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **[[Rosneft]]** | US companies cannot do business |
| **Lukoil** | US companies cannot do business |
| Coverage | ~50% of Russian oil production |
| Mechanism | [[Block]] access to US financial system |

**180+ shadow fleet tankers** designated in Jan 2025 package alone.

### Effectiveness

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Russian oil exports | Largely stable |
| Russian oil revenues | Only slightly reduced |
| Price cap compliance | Widespread evasion |
| Shadow fleet growth | Concentrated, not expanding |

**Chatham House:** "Tightening the oil-price cap to increase pressure on Russia" — calls for stricter enforcement.

### Comparison: Russia vs Iran approach

| | Russia | [[Iran]] |
|--|--------|------|
| Mechanism | OFAC secondary sanctions | Tariffs (25%) |
| [[Target]] | [[Rosneft]], Lukoil, shadow fleet | Any country "doing business" |
| Enforcement | Treasury, seizures | Customs (unclear) |
| Legal basis | Traditional sanctions law | IEEPA (challenged) |

Iran tariff approach is novel — using trade policy instead of financial sanctions.

## Venezuela relationship

**Maduro ally:**

| Support type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Political | Backed Maduro vs opposition |
| Military | Weapons, advisors |
| Oil | [[Rosneft]] had stakes (sold 2020) |
| Debt | Restructured Venezuelan debt |

**Post-[[Maduro capture 2026]]:** Russia loses key Latin America ally. Reaction pending.

---

## China-Russia axis

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Oil sales | Russia → China at discount |
| Technology | China chips/equipment to Russia |
| Payment systems | Ruble-yuan, SWIFT alternatives |
| Geopolitics | United vs US |

**Investment implication:** China companies risk secondary sanctions for Russia dealings.

---

## Semiconductor angle

**Cut off from advanced tech:**

- Cannot buy [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] chips
- [[ASML]] equipment banned
- Domestic chip industry weak
- Military suffering from chip shortage

---

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Sanctions tightened | Energy prices up, Russia assets down |
| Sanctions eased | Russia assets rally, oil prices down |
| China trade grows | Secondary sanction risk for China |
| Venezuela fallout | Loses regional influence |

**Not directly investable** for US persons — sanctions prohibit most transactions.
