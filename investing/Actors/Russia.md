## Why Russia matters

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Oil/gas producer | ~10M bpd oil, major gas exporter |
| Sanctions target | Comprehensive US/EU sanctions since 2022 |
| China alliance | Energy sales, tech workarounds |
| Venezuela ally | Political/military support for Maduro |

## Energy position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Oil production | ~10M bpd |
| Gas production | Major (Europe dependent pre-2022) |
| Oil companies | Rosneft, Gazprom, Lukoil |
| Export markets | China, India (discounted) |

**Post-2022:** Europe cut off Russian gas → pivot to Asia.

## Sanctions impact

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Oil price cap | $60/barrel ceiling (leaky) |
| Gas | Europe largely off Russian gas |
| Technology | Cut off from Western chips/equipment |
| Finance | Removed from SWIFT (major banks) |
| Semiconductors | Cannot buy advanced chips |

See [[Sanctions]], [[OFAC]] for policy details.

## Venezuela relationship

**Maduro ally:**

| Support type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Political | Backed Maduro vs opposition |
| Military | Weapons, advisors |
| Oil | Rosneft had stakes (sold 2020) |
| Debt | Restructured Venezuelan debt |

**Post-[[Maduro capture 2026]]:** Russia loses key Latin America ally. Reaction pending.

## China-Russia axis

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Oil sales | Russia → China at discount |
| Technology | China chips/equipment to Russia |
| Payment systems | Ruble-yuan, SWIFT alternatives |
| Geopolitics | United vs US |

**Investment implication:** China companies risk secondary sanctions for Russia dealings.

## Semiconductor angle

**Cut off from advanced tech:**

- Cannot buy [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] chips
- [[ASML]] equipment banned
- Domestic chip industry weak
- Military suffering from chip shortage

---

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Sanctions tightened | Energy prices up, Russia assets down |
| Sanctions eased | Russia assets rally, oil prices down |
| China trade grows | Secondary sanction risk for China |
| Venezuela fallout | Loses regional influence |
