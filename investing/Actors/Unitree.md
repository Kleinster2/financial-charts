## Why Unitree matters

Most visible Chinese robotics company globally:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | [[Hangzhou]] |
| Focus | Quadruped robots (robot dogs) |
| Price point | [[Consumer]]/prosumer (~$1,600-$150,000) |
| Comparison | Boston Dynamics but 10x cheaper |
| Founder | [[Wang Xingxing]] |
| Founder net worth | $2.15B (Bloomberg Feb 2026) |
| Status | Private |

## Products

| Model | Type | Price | Use case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Go2 | Quadruped | ~$1,600 | [[Consumer]], education |
| B2 | Quadruped | ~$20,000 | Industrial inspection |
| H1 | Humanoid | ~$90,000 | Research, demo |
| G1 | Humanoid | ~$16,000 | Education, prosumer |

Key differentiator: Dramatically lower price than Western competitors. Boston Dynamics Spot = $75,000+. Unitree Go2 = $1,600.

## Comparison to peers

| Company | HQ | Focus | Price tier | Status |
|---------|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| Unitree | Hangzhou | Quadruped + humanoid | Low-mid | Private |
| Boston Dynamics | US | Quadruped + humanoid | High | [[Hyundai]] subsidiary |
| [[Figure AI]] | US | Humanoid | High | Private ($2.6B) |
| [[Agility Robotics]] | US | Humanoid (Digit) | High | Private |
| [[Tesla]] Optimus | US | Humanoid | TBD | Tesla division |

Unitree's niche: Volume + affordability. Not the most capable, but most accessible.

## Investment implications

Private company — not directly investable.

Indirect exposure:
- [[Robotics]] component suppliers
- [[China]] robotics ETFs (limited)

Thesis implications:
- [[China]] can compete in robotics at scale
- Price disruption similar to [[China]] EV playbook
- [[Hangzhou]] validated as robotics hub
- Watch for IPO (likely HK or [[China]] A-shares)

---

## Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Export restrictions | US may restrict robot sales |
| IP concerns | Western markets may resist |
| Competition | [[Tesla Optimus]], Figure AI scaling |
| Margins | Low price = thin margins |
