## Products

| Model | Type | Price | Use case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Go2 | Quadruped | ~$1,600 | Consumer, education |
| B2 | Quadruped | ~$20,000 | Industrial inspection (IP67) |
| G1 | Humanoid | ~$16,000 | Education, prosumer (43 DOF) |
| R1 | Humanoid | ~$5,900 | Consumer humanoid (Jul 2025) |
| H1 | Humanoid | ~$90,000 | Research |
| H2 | Humanoid | — | 1.8m, sword routines ([[2026 Spring Festival Gala]]) |

Key differentiator: Go2 at $1,600 vs. [[Boston Dynamics]] Spot at $75,000+. 10x cheaper through in-house QDD actuators, injection-molded chassis, and [[Yangtze River Delta]] supply chain density. See [[Unitree Cost Architecture]].

Unit sales (2024): 23,700 quadrupeds (~70% global share), 1,500+ humanoids. G1 shipped 5,000 units in H1 2025.

## What makes Unitree, Unitree

Three deep dives cover the structural advantages:

[[Unitree Cost Architecture]] — in-house PMSM actuators (~$30-60 each vs. $500-2,000+ for harmonic drives), 90% vertical integration, 284K+ identical motors/year, injection-molded polymer vs. CNC-machined aluminum. Structural cost moat analogous to [[DJI]] in drones.

[[Unitree Quadruped Bridge]] — 7 years of quadrupeds (2016-2023) gave shared RL algorithms, actuator hardware, manufacturing infrastructure, and 50,000+ deployed units of real-world data before building a single humanoid. Went from zero humanoid experience to 5,500+ units shipped in ~2 years — no competitor matched this pace.

[[Unitree GTM Strategy]] — [[Clayton Christensen]] disruption: consumer-first (Go2 at $1,600 for virality and volume), EDU variants ($8-12K, pure software margin), open developer ecosystem (30+ GitHub repos, ROS2 native), then enterprise migration ([[Great Wall Motors]], [[BYD]], [[Geely]], China Mobile). ~50% revenue from overseas.

## Spring Festival Gala performances

2025 — "YangBOT": 16 humanoids performing Yangge folk dance. Went viral. [[Wang Xingxing]] met [[Xi Jinping]] at a tech symposium weeks later.

2026 — "Wu BOT": With Henan Tagou Martial Arts School. H1/H2 performing parkour, Drunken Fist, nunchaku, trampoline backflips. Technical firsts: force-controlled weapon strikes, 3m aerial flips, 4 m/s cluster repositioning. Four companies paid ~100M yuan for 2026 partnerships: Unitree, [[MagicLab]], [[Galbot]], [[Noetix]]. See [[2026 Spring Festival Gala]].

## Investment case

Bull:
- Profitable robotics company with 10x YoY revenue growth
- Structural cost moat via [[Unitree Cost Architecture|vertical integration + Chinese supply chain]]
- [[Unitree Quadruped Bridge|Quadruped bridge]] gives 2-3 year head start over humanoid-first competitors
- IPO mid-2026 at $7B — potentially conservative by STAR Market standards
- Government-endorsed ([[Xi Jinping]] meeting, gala visibility, [[Pre-IPO tutoring]] completed in 4 months)

Bear:
- Q1 2025 revenue spike may be one-time orders, not sustainable demand
- Humanoid factory use still narrow (inspection/patrol, not assembly)
- Competition intensifies: [[Tesla]] Optimus targeting <$20K, [[AGIBOT]] scaling
- Export restrictions if US-China tensions escalate
- Pre-IPO financials need scrutiny (see [[Unitree Financials]])
