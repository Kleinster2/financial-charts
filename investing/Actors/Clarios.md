# Clarios

Global leader in low-voltage battery technology for mobility. Their batteries power 1 in 3 cars on the road today.

## Overview

- **HQ:** Glendale, Wisconsin
- **Employees:** ~18,000 across 100+ countries
- **Revenue:** $10.6B (FY2024)
- **Output:** 150M+ batteries annually
- **US footprint:** 16 manufacturing facilities, 5,500 domestic employees
- **Parent:** [[Brookfield Business Partners]]

Founded 1885. Spun out of [[Johnson Controls]] battery division in 2019.

## Strategic position

Core business is lead-acid batteries for automotive starting/lighting/ignition (SLI) — the battery that starts your car. Also expanding into advanced AGM (absorbent glass mat) batteries for start-stop systems and mild hybrids.

Lead-acid isn't glamorous but it's essential. Every ICE vehicle needs one, and even EVs use 12V lead-acid batteries for auxiliary systems. Clarios controls ~35% of global market.

## Critical minerals exposure

Lead-acid batteries require:
- **Lead** — primary material, ~60% of battery weight
- **Sulfuric acid**
- **Plastics** for casings

Lead is highly recyclable (~99% recovery rate), giving Clarios a circular supply chain advantage. Company claims 8,000+ collection points for battery recycling.

## Recent developments

**Jan 2025:** Announced $6B investment over 10 years to expand US manufacturing, framed as strengthening domestic minerals supply chain.

**Feb 2026:** Signed up as founding member of [[Project Vault]], the $12B US [[critical minerals]] stockpile. Will pay membership fee for right to draw materials during supply emergencies.
