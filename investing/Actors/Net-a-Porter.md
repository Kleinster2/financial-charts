## Why YNAP failed under Richemont

- **Tech underinvestment:** Platform fell behind competitors
- **Brand confusion:** Luxury + off-price under one roof
- **Execution:** Multiple CEO changes, strategic pivots
- **Competition:** Farfetch, Mytheresa, brand direct sites
- **€1.46B loss (2023):** Unsustainable burn
