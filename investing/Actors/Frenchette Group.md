## Background

Nasr (Montreal native) trained with Michel Bras in [[France]] before moving to New York for Daniel in 1993. Hanson came up through Le Cirque, Aureole ([[Charlie Palmer]]), and Vong ([[Jean-Georges Vongerichten]]). McNally tapped them as co-executive chefs for Balthazar in 1997 — they ran his kitchens until parting ways in 2013. Five years of planning preceded Frenchette's 2018 opening.

The group's identity centers on accessible, well-executed French cooking without fine-dining formality. Every concept riffs on a different era or mode of French restaurant culture: Frenchette (neo-bistro), Le Rock (grand cafe), Le Veau` d'Or (classic bistro preservation), Wild Cherry (theater-district supper club).

## Ownership

Chef-owned by [[Riad Nasr]] and [[Lee Hanson]]. No outside investors or institutional funding disclosed. Self-financed growth from a single Tribeca restaurant (2018) to seven locations across five concepts. Private — no known cap table changes or fundraising.
