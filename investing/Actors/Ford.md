## China partnership talks (Jan 2026)

**FT: Ford exploring JV with Chinese EV makers**

| Partner | Status | Structure |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [[Xiaomi]] | Preliminary talks | US manufacturing JV |
| [[BYD]] | Discussions | Potential collaboration |
| Others | Exploring | Unknown |

**Context:**
- CEO Jim Farley personally imported Xiaomi SU7, called Chinese EVs "existential threat"
- Farley: Chinese companies "absolutely coming" to the US
- Trump (Jan 2026 at Ford Dearborn): "If they want to come in and build a plant... I love that"
- Ford already has [[CATL]] battery licensing deal (Pentagon-flagged)

**Political backlash:**
- Rep. John Moolenaar (House China Committee chair): "turning its back on American and allied partners"
- Former US official: "dangerous domino effect" — could force other US automakers into "forced marriage" with Beijing

**Ford denial:** "This story is completely false." (FT has 4 sources)

**Why Ford is vulnerable:**
- Discontinued Escape and Edge with nothing until 2027 Universal EV Platform
- F-150 Lightning ending production
- Chinese rivals 30-50% cheaper
