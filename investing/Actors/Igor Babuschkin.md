From his departure post: "I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed."

*Departure context: Left before Greg Yang (Jan 2026) and Sulaiman Ghori (Jan 2026). Part of broader xAI co-founder exodus.*
