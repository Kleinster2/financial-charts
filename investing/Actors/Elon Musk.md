**Elon Musk** — Controls multiple entities relevant to AI/semiconductor thesis. Political influence through DOGE role.

---

## Why Musk matters for semis

Musk's combined entities represent significant chip demand and policy influence:

| Entity | Role | Relevance |
|--------|------|-----------|
| [[xAI]] | Founder/CEO | 100k+ H100s (Colossus), 1M+ GPU plans |
| [[Tesla]] | CEO | FSD chips, potential foundry customer |
| [[SpaceX]] | CEO | Custom satellite chips, 2026 IPO |
| [[DOGE]] | Co-lead (departed) | AI policy, export controls influence |

**Combined leverage:** Tesla + xAI together could anchor [[Samsung]] Taylor fab — one of the bull cases for Korea.

## Political connections

**Trump administration (2025-):**
- **DOGE:** Former Co-lead (departed Dec 2025), remains highly influential advisor.
- Direct White House access
- Influence on AI policy, export controls, space policy.

**Relevant policy wins:**
- AI Diffusion framework canceled (benefited NVIDIA)
- H200 approved for [[China]] export
- [[David Sacks]] (ally) as AI/crypto czar
- **Antitrust:** Advocates for deregulation; seen as a beneficiary of [[Lina Khan]]'s departure from FTC.

**[[Venezuela]] Role (Post-Maduro Jan 2026):**
- **Geopolitical:** Strongly anti-Maduro; likely to advocate for digital freedom/connectivity.
- **Starlink:** Potential role for [[SpaceX]]'s Starlink in providing internet infrastructure to a rebuilding [[Venezuela]], especially in remote areas or as an alternative to state-controlled telecom.

**[[Iran]] (Jan 12, 2026):**
- Trump said he'll call Musk about deploying [[Starlink]] to restore internet amid protests
- "He's very good at that kind of thing"
- [[Iran]] jamming Starlink with military-grade systems
- Echoes 2022 Mahsa Amini protests offer

## Investment network

| Person | Connection | Relevance |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **[[David Sacks]]** | Close ally, [[Craft Ventures]] | AI czar, [[Groq]] investor |
| **[[Chamath Palihapitiya]]** | Social Capital | [[Groq]] investor ($4B payout) |
| **[[Peter Thiel]]** | [[PayPal mafia]] | [[Palantir]], [[Founders Fund]] |

## xAI infrastructure

See [[xAI]] for details.

- **Colossus (Memphis):** 100k H100s, expanding to 1M+ GPUs
- **Colossus 2 (Tennessee):** 400MW near-term, 2GW path
- **Investors:** [[Saudi PIF]], UAE [[MGX]], [[Blackstone]], [[AMD]], NVIDIA

---

## Samsung anchor thesis

**The case:**
- Tesla already has Samsung relationship (some chips)
- xAI needs massive fab capacity
- Combined, Musk entities could anchor Samsung Taylor
- Political alignment: Musk influence + Korea-friendly trade policy

**For [[Short TSMC long Korea]]:** Musk as Samsung anchor = bullish Korea

---

## Risks / Considerations

- Attention span across too many entities
- Political volatility
- Tesla valuation depends on FSD/robotaxi (chip-intensive)
- xAI competing against [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Google]] with less capital

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net worth | ~$400B+ (fluctuates) |
| Companies | Tesla, xAI, SpaceX, [[Neuralink]], Boring Co |
| GPU demand | 100k+ current, 1M+ planned |
| Political role | DOGE co-lead |
