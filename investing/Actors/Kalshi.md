## What makes Kalshi, Kalshi

**First-mover in regulated event contracts.** While [[Polymarket]] operates offshore, Kalshi took the hard path: 2+ years of CFTC engagement to become the first federally licensed prediction market exchange. This creates a potential moat if federal preemption holds.

**The regulatory arbitrage play:**
1. CFTC licenses Kalshi as derivatives exchange
2. States say prediction markets = gambling (their jurisdiction)
3. If federal preemption wins → Kalshi has nationwide license
4. If states win → sports contracts (~90% of volume) blocked state-by-state

**The bet:** Selig's CFTC will codify federal preemption in 2026 rulemaking.

## State vs federal fight

**The core question:** Does CFTC license = nationwide permission, or can states classify as gambling?

| State | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Massachusetts** | Injunction granted (Jan 2026) | First court to block Kalshi |
| **Nevada** | Injunction dissolved | State enforcement active |
| **Ohio** | Citing MA ruling | "Domino effect" risk |
| **New Jersey** | Coordinating with Ohio | — |

**Kalshi's argument:** Event contracts are derivatives under Commodity Exchange Act; federal law preempts state gambling laws.

**States' argument:** Sports prediction markets are functionally sports betting; states regulate gambling.

Massachusetts injunction stayed through Super Bowl 2026 pending appeal. If states win broadly, Kalshi loses ~90% of volume.

## The bull case

1. **Selig rulemaking includes federal preemption** — states can't block
2. **Prediction markets go mainstream** — 2024 election validated vs polls
3. **First-mover moat** — regulatory license is hard to replicate
4. **Category expansion** — beyond politics/sports to finance, weather, corporate events

## The bear case

1. **States win** — 90% of volume (sports) blocked state-by-state
2. **Supreme Court rules against preemption** — existential
3. **[[Polymarket]] competition** — offshore, no restrictions
4. **Regulatory reversal** — future CFTC could tighten
