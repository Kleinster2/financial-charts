## Products

- **Voice synthesis platform** — text-to-speech, voice cloning, AI dubbing
- **Conversational AI agents** — voice-first AI interactions
- **Eleven Music** — AI music generation
- **Iconic Voice Marketplace** (Nov 2025) — brands legally license AI-replicated voices of celebrities and historical figures for ads, entertainment, branded storytelling

### Iconic Voice Marketplace

Launched Nov 2025 at ElevenLabs Summit. 28 initial voices including Michael Caine, Maya Angelou, Alan Turing, Mark Twain. Solves the ethical/legal dilemma of AI voice cloning — rights holders license their voice IP, brands pay to use it. Revenue share model.

[[Matthew McConaughey]] invested in ElevenLabs alongside the marketplace launch.

**Strategic significance:** Creates a two-sided marketplace for voice IP — similar to how music licensing works but for AI-generated speech. First-mover advantage in defining the legal framework for celebrity voice licensing. As voice AI proliferates, this could become the standard clearinghouse.
