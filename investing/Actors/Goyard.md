## The Goyardine pattern

The distinctive hand-painted chevron canvas is inspired by the Goyard family's origins as log drivers (Compagnons de Rivière) in Burgundy. The dotted V-pattern evokes logs floating on water. Created by Edmond Goyard in 1892, the printing technique produces a slightly raised texture that's difficult to counterfeit.

## Ownership and M&A speculation

Jean-Michel Signoles acquired Goyard in 1998 after "coveting it for 20 years" (NYT interview, 2009). He founded Chipie (children's clothing) before turning around Goyard, which was accumulating losses at acquisition.

**Potential acquirers:**
- [[LVMH]] — would add heritage trunk maker alongside [[Louis Vuitton]]
- [[Kering]] — analyst Mario Ortelli (Bernstein): "The Goyard brand would be compatible with Kering's portfolio"

Signoles has not confirmed or denied interest in selling. The company remains one of the few independent luxury houses of scale.

## Investment implications

**Private company — no direct investment available.**

**As M&A signal:**
- Goyard sale would be major luxury M&A event
- Estimated revenue $40M–$140M (unclear, private company)
- Valuation would likely command premium given brand strength, resale value leadership, and scarcity of independent luxury assets

**Comparable transaction:** [[LVMH]] acquired Rimowa (German luggage) for €640M in 2016.
