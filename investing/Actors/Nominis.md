## Competitive landscape

| Company | HQ | Stage | Strength |
|---------|-----|-------|----------|
| Chainalysis | NYC | Late (valued ~$8.6B in 2022) | Market leader, law enforcement relationships, broadest coverage |
| Elliptic | London | Series C | Enterprise compliance, acquired by Galaxy Digital |
| TRM Labs | San Francisco | Series B ($60M) | Fast-growing, multi-chain, government contracts |
| Crystal Intelligence | Amsterdam | Acquired (Bitfury spinout) | Eastern European blockchain expertise |
| Nominis | Tel Aviv | Seed | Hybrid on-chain/off-chain/behavioral signals, dark web integration |

Nominis differentiates on the off-chain layer — most competitors focus primarily on on-chain graph analysis. Adding dark web, social media, and behavioral intelligence gives a fuller picture but is harder to scale and validate.

## Why it matters

Crypto compliance infrastructure is becoming mandatory as regulations tighten globally (MiCA in Europe, FinCEN in US, VARA in Dubai). The question is whether the market consolidates around Chainalysis or whether specialists like Nominis can carve out niches — particularly in terror financing detection and hybrid intelligence, where [[Israel]]'s security expertise is a structural advantage.

The [[Mastercard]] incubator backing is notable — traditional payments infrastructure players are building crypto compliance tooling into their stack rather than treating it as optional.
