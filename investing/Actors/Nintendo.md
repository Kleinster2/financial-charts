**Nintendo** — [[Switch]] 2 squeezed by memory costs. $14B market cap loss. Poster child for AI memory crowding.

---

## Why Nintendo matters for this vault

Nintendo is the clearest victim of AI-driven memory reallocation:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Problem | [[Switch]] 2 memory costs +41% |
| Market cap loss | $14B (Dec 2025) |
| Memory % of BOM | 21-23% |
| Margin impact | Near break-even on hardware |

## [[Switch]] 2 memory crisis

**Cost explosion:**
| Component | Increase |
|-----------|----------|
| DRAM (12GB LPDDR5X) | +41% in 3 months |
| NAND (256GB) | +8% |

**Specs:**
- 12GB LPDDR5X RAM (2x 6GB [[Micron]] modules)
- 256GB NAND storage
- $450 launch price (higher than [[Switch]] 1)

Bloomberg (Feb 15): Nintendo contemplating **raising Switch 2 price in 2026** due to ongoing memory cost pressure. Contributed to surplus demand in 2025 as Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases.

**Margin reality:**
- Selling at slim profit in [[Japan]]
- Break-even or loss in other markets
- No room for traditional mid-cycle price cuts

---

## Stock impact

**$14B market cap evaporation:**
- Share price at lowest since [[Switch]] 2 debut
- Investors worried about margin squeeze
- Memory costs structural, not temporary

---

## Root cause

**AI crowding out consumer memory:**
- [[SK Hynix]] converting DRAM production to [[HBM]]
- [[Samsung]], [[Micron]] following
- [[Consumer]] LPDDR5X deprioritized
- Shortage extends through 2026+

Nintendo has no leverage — they're a price taker.

## Strategic options (limited)

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Raise prices | Already at $450, demand risk |
| Cut specs | Compromises product |
| Absorb costs | Destroys margins |
| Wait | Shortage persists through 2026 |

No good choices.

## Comparison to peers

| Console maker | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Nintendo** | Launched anyway, eating costs |
| [[Sony]] | Considering delaying PS6 past 2028 |
| [[Microsoft]] | Same delay considerations |

Nintendo committed to [[Switch]] 2 launch; others may delay.

## Investment case

**Bear (current situation):**
- Memory costs structural headwind
- Margins compressed
- No pricing power vs memory makers
- Hardware may be loss leader

**Bull (contrarian):**
- Software margins unaffected
- Strong IP (Mario, Zelda, Pokemon)
- If memory normalizes post-2027
- Depressed valuation
