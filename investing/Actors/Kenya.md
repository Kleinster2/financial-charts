## US-China trade pressure (Jan 2026)

**Kenya-China trade deal stalled by US pressure** (The Standard, Jan 11, 2026):

- Kenya negotiating trade deal with China
- Deal requires cabinet, parliament, president assent
- US pressuring Kenya not to sign
- Kenya simultaneously seeking AGOA extension (duty-free US access)
- Effectively forced to choose between US and China pacts

**Pattern:** US weaponizing AGOA renewal as leverage against China deals across Africa.

## Strategic significance

1. **Regional hub**: Nairobi is East Africa's financial/logistics center
2. **Port access**: Mombasa port — China has invested heavily
3. **Tech hub**: "Silicon Savannah" — growing tech sector
4. **Debt exposure**: Significant Chinese infrastructure loans (SGR railway)

## Investment lens

Kenya itself is hard to invest in directly, but it's a bellwether for:
- US-China competition in Africa
- AGOA as US leverage tool
- Belt & Road debt dynamics
- African trade bloc formation
