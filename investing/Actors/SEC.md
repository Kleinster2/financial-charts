## What makes SEC, SEC

**The investor protection agency.** SEC's mandate: protect investors, maintain fair markets, facilitate capital formation. In practice: registration of securities, disclosure requirements, enforcement against fraud.

**Core philosophy:** Disclosure over prohibition. Companies must tell investors what they need to know — SEC doesn't judge whether investments are good, just whether information is adequate.

## Gensler era (2021-2025)

"Regulation by enforcement" — SEC brought 100+ crypto enforcement actions without clear rules.

| Action | Target | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 2023 | Ripple (XRP) | Partial loss — token sales to public not securities |
| 2023 | Coinbase | Sued for unregistered exchange |
| 2023 | Binance | Sued for securities violations |
| 2024 | Various | Continued enforcement |

**Criticism:** No clear guidance on which tokens are securities. Industry called it "regulation by ambush."

## Atkins era (2025-)

**Pivot to clarity:**

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Crypto Task Force** | Launched to draft clear rules |
| **SAB 121 repeal** | Banks can custody crypto (Q2 2025) |
| **Taxonomy framework** | Joint with [[CFTC]] — commodities vs securities |
| **End enforcement-first** | Rulemaking before litigation |

**Jan 29, 2026 joint event:**
- Atkins and [[Michael Selig]] presented unified crypto approach

## SEC vs CFTC

| Issue | SEC | CFTC |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Core mandate** | Securities | Derivatives/commodities |
| **Crypto view** | Many tokens = securities (Howey test) | Crypto = commodity |
| **Spot markets** | Can regulate if security | Limited (fraud only) |
| **Turf** | Bigger budget, more staff | More derivatives expertise |

**2026 resolution:** Joint taxonomy — SEC handles security tokens, CFTC handles commodity tokens. Congress may codify.
