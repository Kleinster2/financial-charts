## What makes Stone Point, Stone Point

**Pure financial services focus.** Unlike generalist PE firms, Stone Point only invests in financial services — insurance, asset management, banking services, specialty finance, fintech. This specialization creates:

1. **Deep bench**: 85+ investment professionals with sector expertise
2. **Operating playbook**: 30+ years of financial services transactions
3. **Rollup expertise**: Buy-and-build strategy across fragmented verticals (claims admin, insurance services, fund admin)
4. **Regulatory fluency**: Understands capital requirements, licensing, compliance

**The "Elephant Process"** — Stone Point's proprietary investment philosophy emphasizes partnership with founders and owner-operators rather than hostile approaches.
