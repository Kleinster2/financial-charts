**Radiant** — [[Brookfield]]'s GPU-as-a-service company, created Feb 2026 by acquiring UK cloud-computing startup **Ori Industries** (backed by [[Saudi Aramco]]'s venture arm). Provides on-demand access to AI chips via leasing contracts.

---

## What it does

Radiant offers "chips-for-rent" — bundling GPU access with data center space and power contracts as a fully integrated AI infrastructure solution. Targets:

- **Sovereign cloud** customers (governments needing data within national borders)
- **Investment-grade** enterprise customers
- **Europe initially**, with Middle East expansion planned

## Business model

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Structure | GPU leasing — contracts lock in rents across ~5-year chip life |
| Risk model | "We will not be taking any technology risk" — Sikander Rashid |
| Contracts | Take-or-pay: customers pay full freight even if they stop using chips |
| Customers | Expected to be investment grade |
| GPU supplier | [[NVIDIA]] — including forthcoming [[Rubin]] chips for agentic AI |
| Parent fund | Brookfield AI Infrastructure Fund (seeking $10B commitments, up to $100B with leverage) |

**Key quote:** "I think of it as a leasing business. Hopefully we are the first of many who will unlock large-scale capital to the theme." — Sikander Rashid, Brookfield Head of AI Infrastructure

---

## Why it matters

Radiant represents **alternative asset managers entering GPU economics** — a new layer between chip manufacturers ([[NVIDIA]]) and end users. The model:

1. Brookfield raises infrastructure capital at low cost of capital
2. Buys GPUs in bulk from NVIDIA
3. Leases them on take-or-pay contracts to investment-grade customers
4. Bundles with power (Brookfield owns renewables) + data center space

This is the **financialization of compute** — the same playbook that transformed aircraft (GECAS, AerCap), rolling stock, and power generation. GPU economics are converging with infrastructure finance.

Other firms have avoided GPU-as-a-service, fearing chips lose value or become obsolete. Brookfield is betting that take-or-pay contracts with investment-grade counterparties eliminates that risk.

| Backers | Saudi Aramco Ventures |
| Acquired | Feb 24, 2026 |
| Terms | Undisclosed |
| Merged into | Radiant |

## Brookfield AI context

[[Brookfield]] estimates AI will require **$7 trillion** in total capital investment, with **$3 trillion** for computing infrastructure alone. Radiant is one of the first deployments from the AI infrastructure fund.

Other Brookfield AI bets:
- Up to **$5B in [[Bloom Energy]]** (fuel cells for data centers)
- Data center operators
- Utility stakes benefiting from surging power demand
- [[NVIDIA]] is an equity contributor to the AI fund *and* chip supplier to Radiant

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Model | Backing |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Radiant** (Brookfield) | Take-or-pay GPU leasing | $10-100B fund |
| [[CoreWeave]] | GPU cloud (hyperscaler) | $7.5B+ debt |
| [[Lambda Labs]] | On-demand GPU cloud | VC-backed |
| [[SF Compute]] | Managed clusters, spot pricing | Independent |
| [[Vast.ai]] | GPU marketplace (P2P) | Independent |

Radiant's differentiation: infrastructure-grade contracts (take-or-pay, investment-grade customers) vs. spot/on-demand models of cloud GPU providers. Lower risk, lower return, but massive scale.
