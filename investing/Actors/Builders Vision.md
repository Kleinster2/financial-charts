## Rare earth thesis

**James Lindsay (Director of Investments):**

On rare earths as climate issue:
> "We frame rare earths as a climate issue because it's fueling so much of the transition, with EVs being the front and center spotlight of it."

On US catch-up potential (comparing to oil/gas 2005-2015):
> "A 15-year cycle has been done before."

**View:** US rare earth supply chain build-out requires less capital than oil/gas transformation — achievable within similar timeframe.
