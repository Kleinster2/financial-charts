## Brand portfolio

| Brand | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Anta | Own label | Core brand, mass market |
| [[Fila]] | License (China) | Premium positioning, ~40% of revenue |
| [[Descente]] | JV | Premium outdoor |
| [[Jack Wolfskin]] | Owned | European outdoor brand |
| [[Puma]] | 29% stake (2026) | Largest shareholder |

**Strategy:** Own-brand for mass market, licensed/acquired Western brands for premium positioning. Fila China has been the growth engine.

## Puma stake (Feb 2026)

Acquiring 29% of [[Puma]], becoming largest shareholder (displacing Artémis/Pinault family).

**Rationale:**
- Puma's China sales -20% (2023-2025) — needs local expertise
- Anta brings distribution, digital, and localization capabilities
- Asia Pacific is ~20% of Puma's sales — upside if turnaround works

**For Anta:** Validates global brand management model. If Puma China recovers, proves Anta can be more than a regional player.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Dominant China position in growing sportswear market
- Multi-brand portfolio diversifies risk
- 17% revenue CAGR vs peers at 4-5%
- Puma stake could be template for more Western brand partnerships
- Olympics/sports sponsorship momentum (China national teams)

**Bear:**
- Almost entirely China revenue — geopolitical/macro exposure
- Fila license renewal risk (expires 2050s but renegotiation possible)
- Western brand acquisitions historically mixed (Jack Wolfskin struggling)
- Nike/Adidas localizing faster — competitive moat narrowing
- Premium valuation vs peers
