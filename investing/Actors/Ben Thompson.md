## Key frameworks

### Aggregation Theory
Thompson's signature contribution. Describes how internet platforms systematically dominate industries by:
1. Having a direct relationship with users
2. Zero marginal cost of serving additional users
3. Demand-driven networks with decreasing acquisition costs

Aggregators ([[Google]], [[Meta]], [[Amazon]]) win by owning demand, making suppliers commoditized. The internet flipped the value chain: pre-internet, distribution was scarce and content/products were commoditized upstream; post-internet, content is abundant and aggregators who control demand win.

### Smiling curve / value chain analysis
Analyzes where value accrues in technology stacks. Used to explain why [[Apple]] captures most smartphone profits, why [[TSMC]] dominates foundry, and why cloud platforms beat on-premise software.

### Stratechery concepts
- Super-aggregators — Platforms so dominant they set terms for entire ecosystems ([[Google]], [[Apple]])
- The Bill Gates Line — Threshold at which horizontal platforms beat vertical integration
- Sovereign writers — Creators who own their audience directly (the model Stratechery itself pioneered)

## Notable analyses

- [[Facebook]]/[[Meta]] pivot — Argued Meta's ad business was more durable than bears claimed during 2022 selloff. Proved correct
- [[Apple]] services thesis — Early to identify services revenue as Apple's strategic future
- [[Netflix]] disruption — Analyzed how [[Netflix]] disrupted linear TV through aggregation
- [[AI]] impact — Extensive analysis of how [[AI]] changes the tech stack, arguing it strengthens aggregators. Covered [[OpenAI]], [[Google]] [[Gemini]], and implications for search
- Antitrust — Argued that traditional antitrust frameworks don't apply well to aggregators because they benefit consumers (zero price, convenience)

## Track record

### Hits ✅
- Aggregation Theory — Has become arguably the most important business framework of the internet era. Widely cited in academia, venture capital, and corporate strategy
- Meta resilience — Correctly argued [[Meta]] was undervalued during 2022 "year of efficiency" panic
- Newsletter model — Proved subscription newsletters could be a viable one-person business. Spawned an entire industry ([[Substack]], [[Ghost]], [[Beehiiv]])
- Apple services — Early identification of services as Apple's strategic moat

### Misses ❌
- Not a financial analyst — Doesn't make price targets or investment recommendations. Framework is strategic, not quantitative
- Platform optimism — Aggregation Theory can lead to over-indexing on incumbents; didn't predict [[TikTok]]'s rise disrupting [[Meta]]/[[YouTube]] attention
- China blind spots — Less coverage of Chinese tech ecosystem dynamics
- AI uncertainty — Has evolved views on [[AI]] significantly; early frameworks didn't fully account for generative AI disrupting the aggregation model itself
