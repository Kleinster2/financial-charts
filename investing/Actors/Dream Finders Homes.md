## Insights

**Growth machine** — 17 consecutive years of growth. From startup (2008) to $4.4B revenue and \#14 builder in 16 years.

**Vertical integration strategy** — Unlike pure homebuilders, DFH is capturing ancillary revenue:
- **Cherry Creek Mortgage** — mortgage origination
- **[[Alliant National]]** — title underwriting (Apr 2025)
- Title agency operations

**Acquisition-driven** — 10 acquisitions in 6 years including Liberty Communities (Jan 2025), [[Alliant National]] (Apr 2025), Green River Builders.

## Alliant National acquisition

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Target | [[Alliant National]] title underwriter |
| Closed | **April 2025** |
| Rationale | Vertical integration |
| Impact | Financial services +$47M revenue Q2 2025 |

**Strategic logic:** DFH already operated title agencies. Adding underwriter captures the 15-20% of premium that flows to underwriters on every closing.
