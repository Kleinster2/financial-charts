## Strategy

Core thesis is "alchemy of 5%" — hold ETH as primary treasury reserve, earn staking yield (~3.1% CESR), and compound. Planning to deploy Made-in-America Validator Network (MAVAN) staking infrastructure in early 2026. Also retains legacy BTC mining/consulting operations.

Proposed increasing authorized shares from 500M to 50B to facilitate 20:1–100:1 stock splits, keeping share price near $25.
