## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Irreplaceable asset (carrier monopoly)
- Decades-long programs
- Navy shipbuilding priority
- Columbia-class ramp
- Union labor = hard to replicate

**Bear:**
- Fixed-price contract pressure
- Labor shortages (skilled welders)
- Program delays/cost overruns
- Single customer (US Navy)
- Lower margin vs other primes

## Industry dynamics

| Factor | Detail |

| Duopoly | HII + General Dynamics for subs |
| Monopoly | Carriers (HII only) |
| Capacity constrained | Workforce limits |
| Long cycles | 5-10 year builds |
