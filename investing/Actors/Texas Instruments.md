## Manufacturing strategy

**300mm fab advantage:**

| Fab | Location | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| RFAB2 | Richardson, TX | Operational |
| Sherman (LFAB1) | Sherman, TX | Ramping |
| Sherman (LFAB2) | Sherman, TX | Under construction |
| Lehi | Utah | Acquired from Micron |

**$30B+ investment through 2030** in US manufacturing capacity.

**Vertical integration benefits:**
- Lower cost per chip vs 200mm competitors
- Supply chain control
- CHIPS Act beneficiary

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus | TI advantage |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| [[Analog Devices]] | \#2 analog | Scale, 300mm fabs |
| [[Infineon]] | Power/auto | Broader analog portfolio |
| [[NXP]] | Auto MCUs | Analog breadth |
| [[onsemi]] | Power/SiC | Legacy analog, cost |

TI is the **only major analog company with leading-edge 300mm fabs** — competitors still largely on 200mm.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Analog market leader with structural cost advantage
- Data center growing 70% (AI tailwind)
- 300mm fab ramp = margin expansion potential
- Dividend aristocrat (20+ years of increases)
- CHIPS Act beneficiary

**Bear:**
- Heavy capex ($5B/year) pressuring FCF
- Industrial/auto end markets cyclical
- Premium valuation (36x P/E)
- Inventory still elevated
- Capacity may outpace demand

---

## Capital allocation

| Item | Annual |
|------|--------|
| Capex | ~$5B |
| Dividends | ~$4.8B |
| Buybacks | Variable |
| FCF (2025) | ~$2.9B |

**Dividend**: $1.36/quarter ($5.44 annualized), 2.8% yield.
