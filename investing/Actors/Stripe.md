## Stripe Link: Checkout wars entrant

Link is Stripe's one-click checkout competing in the [[Checkout wars]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | **200M** |
| Checkout time | **6 seconds** (3x faster than non-Link) |
| Conversion lift | **+7%** average, **+14%** returning users |
| Purchase frequency | Link users buy **4x** more often |
| BFCM 2024 | 914,000 minutes saved |

**How it works:** Customers save payment info once, then one-click checkout at any Stripe merchant. 200M Link users accessible to hundreds of thousands of Stripe-powered sites.

**Competitive position:**
- vs [[PayPal]]: Faster, less friction, no app switch
- vs [[Apple Pay]]: Works on any device, not iOS-only
- vs [[Shop Pay]]: Any Stripe merchant, not just Shopify

**Key insight:** Only 40% of North American sites support one-click checkout, but 75% of consumers more likely to complete purchase if offered. Massive greenfield opportunity.

Link is a network effect play — more users = more merchants adopt = more users.

## Key metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue growth | +28% (2024) |
| Payment volume | $1.4T (+38% YoY) |
| Fortune 100 customers | 50%+ |
| AI startups launched | 700+ (2024) |

## Bridge acquisition & stablecoin infrastructure

**Stripe acquired Bridge for ~$1.1B (Oct 2024)** — stablecoin orchestration platform that lets businesses accept, hold, and send dollar-backed stablecoins. Bridge received conditional OCC approval for a national trust bank charter in Feb 2026.

**Why it matters:** Positions Stripe as the infrastructure layer for stablecoin payments — businesses integrate once with Stripe, get stablecoin rails without handling crypto compliance directly.

### [[Meta]] stablecoin partnership (Feb 2026)

[[Meta]] is integrating stablecoin-based payments across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, targeting H2 2026. Stripe/Bridge is the leading infrastructure partner:

- **Patrick Collison joined [[Meta]] board** (Apr 2025) — deepened strategic relationship
- [[Meta]] issued RFPs to external infrastructure firms; Stripe is front-runner
- Focus: **creator payouts** and **~$100 cross-border transfers** for 3.5B daily active users
- [[Meta]] not issuing own token — using Stripe as distribution partner at "arm's length"
- Successor to [[Meta]]'s failed Libra/Diem project (wound down 2022)

**Scale:** If adopted across Meta's apps, instantly the largest stablecoin payments network globally. Creator economy alone (~$50B annually across platforms) is a massive addressable flow.

**Regulatory tailwind:** Friendlier US crypto environment under Trump. [[GENIUS Act]] implementation expected by July 2026. OCC granting bank charters to crypto firms.

## AI customers

| Company | Relationship |

| [[Anthropic]] | Payments |
| [[Perplexity]] | Payments |

**Thesis:** AI boom = transaction growth for Stripe.

## IPO status

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| IPO planned? | **No** |
| Founders' view | Better off private |
| Reason | Avoid short-term pressures |
| Alternative | Tender offers for liquidity |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- $159B valuation, growing
- $1.4T payment volume
- AI customers driving growth
- **Link** — 200M user checkout network, +7-14% conversion lift

- Developer-first moat

**Bear:**
- Private (no public access)
- Competition from [[Adyen]], [[PayPal]]
- Take rate pressure
- No IPO catalyst
- Valuation premium
