## Stripe Link: Checkout wars entrant

Link is Stripe's one-click checkout competing in the [[Checkout wars]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | **200M** |
| Checkout time | **6 seconds** (3x faster than non-Link) |
| Conversion lift | **+7%** average, **+14%** returning users |
| Purchase frequency | Link users buy **4x** more often |
| BFCM 2024 | 914,000 minutes saved |

**How it works:** Customers save payment info once, then one-click checkout at any Stripe merchant. 200M Link users accessible to hundreds of thousands of Stripe-powered sites.

**Competitive position:**
- vs [[PayPal]]: Faster, less friction, no app switch
- vs [[Apple Pay]]: Works on any device, not iOS-only
- vs [[Shop Pay]]: Any Stripe merchant, not just Shopify

**Key insight:** Only 40% of North American sites support one-click checkout, but 75% of consumers more likely to complete purchase if offered. Massive greenfield opportunity.

Link is a network effect play — more users = more merchants adopt = more users.
