Mercer Street Hospitality — New York City restaurant and nightlife group founded by [[John McDonald (restaurateur)|John McDonald]] in 1993. Started with MercBar in SoHo when McDonald, a [[Columbia University]] grad, pivoted from a Wall Street path into hospitality through connections to the team building the Mercer Hotel. Now operates a boutique portfolio of 8-10 concepts across New York, Chicago, and Miami. Estimated ~$16M revenue (Kona Equity). McDonald was the first American restaurateur to bring designer Marc Newson to New York (Canteen, 1999), then developed Lever House Restaurant inside the modernist landmark — earning a Michelin star in 2005.

## Ownership

Private, founder-controlled. [[John McDonald (restaurateur)|John McDonald]] is sole founder and CEO. Self-financed growth from a single SoHo bar (1993) to 10+ concepts across three markets.

## Funding rounds

No outside investors, institutional funding, or fundraising rounds disclosed. Entirely self-financed.

## Background

John McDonald's career outside restaurants includes founding CITY Magazine (10 years as editorial director, three National Magazine Awards), co-founding [[Tasting Table]] in 2008 (food-focused daily email publication), and co-founding EBOOST (performance supplement brand, 2007, with Josh Taekman).

His restaurant philosophy centers on proximity and execution — most concepts are within walking distance of his home, allowing daily presence. He describes the approach as knowing what you are and focusing relentlessly on execution. Revenue per employee exceeds industry average (Kona Equity), suggesting operational efficiency despite the boutique scale.

The 2025 Seahorse opening at the renovated [[W Hotels|W New York]]—Union Square marked MSH's entry into hotel dining — a 125-seat room designed by [[Rockwell Group]] with mermaid-scale tiling and yacht-style wood, plus a rooftop bar with retractable roof.
