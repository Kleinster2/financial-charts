## Flagship holdings (detail)

### Warner Music Group

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquired | 2011 for $3.3B |
| Re-IPO'd | June 2020 at ~$15B valuation |
| Current stake | 72% economic, 98% voting |
| Current value | ~$10-11B |
| Return | ~3-4x |
| Structure | [[Dual-class shares]] — total control |

Contrarian bet when consensus said streaming was destroying music. Proved prescient as streaming became the industry's growth engine. See [[Warner Music Group]], [[Music label competitive dynamics]].

### DAZN — sports streaming

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | Majority |
| Strategy | Global sports streaming consolidator |
| Foxtel acquisition | AU$3.4B (completed 2025) |
| Saudi PIF investment | ~$1B for <5% stake (Feb 2025) |
| FIFA Club World Cup | Secured global streaming rights |
| Implied valuation | ~$20B+ (based on PIF stake pricing) |

DAZN is Blavatnik's current empire-building play — acquiring rights and platforms globally. The PIF investment validates the vision and provides capital for further consolidation. Foxtel gives DAZN a major foothold in Australia (pay-TV + streaming + sports rights).

### LyondellBasell

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | ~20% |
| Original bet | Assembled via Basell + Lyondell Chemical merger (2007, $20B) |
| Bankruptcy | 2009 — financial crisis + commodity crash |
| Doubled down | Invested $2.37B personally during/after bankruptcy |
| Bought Apollo's shares | $575M in 2013 as Apollo exited |
| Peak personal profit | ~$8B+ (Forbes 2014) |

Apollo invested $2B, made $12B, sold. Blavatnik bought their shares and kept riding. Forbes: "the biggest individual score from a single deal, ever."

## Investment style

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|---------|
| **Contrarian** | WMG in 2011, LyondellBasell in bankruptcy |
| **Patient/long-duration** | Holds for decades, never pressured to sell |
| **Control-seeking** | Dual-class structures, majority stakes |
| **No outside LPs** | All Blavatnik's personal capital — no fund lifecycle pressure |
| **Sector-agnostic** | Chemicals → music → sports streaming → biotech |
| **Empire builder** | DAZN consolidation strategy mirrors WMG approach |

The private, single-LP structure is key — Blavatnik never faces redemption pressure, LP committees, or fund expiration dates. He can hold forever and add when others are forced to sell.
