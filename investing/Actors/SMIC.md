# SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation)

[[China]]'s largest foundry. Primary vehicle for indigenous chip production under export controls. Proof that sanctions slow but don't stop progress.

---

## Why it matters

SMIC is the test case for [[China]]'s semiconductor independence:
- Only Chinese foundry capable of sub-14nm
- Produced [[Huawei]] Kirin 9000S at 7nm without EUV
- Under US Entity List since Dec 2020

## Technology status

| Node | Status | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| 28nm | Mass production | Mature, profitable |
| 14nm | Mass production | FinFET |
| 7nm (N+2) | Production | Multi-patterning DUV (no EUV) |
| 5nm | R&D | Extreme multi-patterning, low yields |

7nm achievement: Using 4-5x more DUV exposures than normal. Higher cost, lower yields, but functional. Kirin 9000S proves viability.

[[Gap]] to TSMC: 4-5 years behind. TSMC at N3/N2, SMIC struggling with reliable 7nm.

## Capacity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2024 revenue | ~$8B |
| Global foundry share | ~6% |
| Wafer capacity | ~800K 8" equivalent/month |
| Fabs | Shanghai, Beijing, [[Shenzhen]], Tianjin |

Aggressive mature node expansion — adding 28nm capacity while competitors focus on leading edge.

## Export control impact

| Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Entity List (Dec 2020) | License required for US tech |
| EUV ban | Cannot buy ASML EUV |
| DUV restrictions | Older tools still accessible |
| US equipment | [[Applied Materials]], Lam restricted |

Workarounds:
- Stockpiled equipment pre-restrictions
- DUV multi-patterning for 7nm
- Domestic equipment development (SMEE)
- Subsystem upgrades extending tool life

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| [[Huawei]] / HiSilicon | Kirin mobile SoCs |
| Domestic fabless | IoT, automotive, consumer |
| Export (limited) | Mature node chips |

Lost access to most Western customers due to Entity List status.

## Memory shortage impact (Nov 2025)

SMIC warning on memory constraining production:
- Memory shortage coming as manufacturers prioritize business with [[NVIDIA]]
- NVIDIA placing emphasis on highest-value AI data center systems
- Memory allocation to AI = shortage for other applications
- SMIC warned memory shortage may constrain car and electronics production in 2026

Logic chip knock-on:
- SMIC is a logic foundry, not memory maker
- But customers can't place logic orders if they can't secure memory
- Memory shortage indirectly constrains SMIC's business

---

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | SMIC is years behind, not a near-term threat |
| [[Export controls]] | SMIC progress = controls leaking; stagnation = controls working |
| [[Long WFE]] | [[China]] equipment demand partly SMIC-driven |
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | Memory shortage constrains SMIC's customers |

## Q4 2025 results and overcapacity warning (Feb 11, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 2025 |
|--------|---------|
| Revenue | $2.49B (+12.8% YoY, beat) |
| Net income | +60.7% YoY (beat) |
| 2025 capex | $8.1B (+10.5%) |
| 2026 capex guide | ~$8.1B (flat) |
| 2026 capacity adds | +40K 12" wafers/mo |

Co-CEO Zhao Haijun warned AI data center capacity "has not been fully thought through" — compared current buildout to Chinese suburban data centers built in the early 2020s that still lack tenants. Revenue guidance flat as low-end orders (smartphones, consumer) squeezed by AI chip demand prioritization.

## What to watch

- [ ] 5nm progress and yield reports
- [ ] Domestic equipment adoption (SMEE lithography)
- [ ] New fab announcements
- [ ] Huawei chip roadmap (SMIC-dependent)
- [ ] US tightening of DUV restrictions
- [ ] AI data center utilization rates — Zhao's overcapacity warning
