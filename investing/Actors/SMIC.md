# SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation)

China's largest foundry. Primary vehicle for indigenous chip production under export controls. Proof that sanctions slow but don't stop progress.

---

## Why it matters

SMIC is the test case for China's semiconductor independence:
- Only Chinese foundry capable of sub-14nm
- Produced [[Huawei]] Kirin 9000S at 7nm without EUV
- Under US Entity List since Dec 2020

## Technology status

| Node | Status | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| 28nm | Mass production | Mature, profitable |
| 14nm | Mass production | FinFET |
| 7nm (N+2) | Production | Multi-patterning DUV (no EUV) |
| 5nm | R&D | Extreme multi-patterning, low yields |

**7nm achievement**: Using 4-5x more DUV exposures than normal. Higher cost, lower yields, but functional. Kirin 9000S proves viability.

**Gap to TSMC**: 4-5 years behind. TSMC at N3/N2, SMIC struggling with reliable 7nm.

## Capacity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2024 revenue | ~$8B |
| Global foundry share | ~6% |
| Wafer capacity | ~800K 8" equivalent/month |
| Fabs | Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Tianjin |

Aggressive mature node expansion — adding 28nm capacity while competitors focus on leading edge.

## Export control impact

| Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Entity List (Dec 2020) | License required for US tech |
| EUV ban | Cannot buy ASML EUV |
| DUV restrictions | Older tools still accessible |
| US equipment | Applied Materials, Lam restricted |

**Workarounds**:
- Stockpiled equipment pre-restrictions
- DUV multi-patterning for 7nm
- Domestic equipment development (SMEE)
- Subsystem upgrades extending tool life

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| [[Huawei]] / HiSilicon | Kirin mobile SoCs |
| Domestic fabless | IoT, automotive, consumer |
| Export (limited) | Mature node chips |

Lost access to most Western customers due to Entity List status.

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | SMIC is years behind, not a near-term threat |
| [[Export controls]] | SMIC progress = controls leaking; stagnation = controls working |
| [[Long WFE]] | China equipment demand partly SMIC-driven |

---

## What to watch

- [ ] 5nm progress and yield reports
- [ ] Domestic equipment adoption (SMEE lithography)
- [ ] New fab announcements
- [ ] Huawei chip roadmap (SMIC-dependent)
- [ ] US tightening of DUV restrictions
