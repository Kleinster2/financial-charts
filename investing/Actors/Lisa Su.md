**Lisa Su** — AMD CEO. Leading NVIDIA challenger. TSMC relationship (she's Morris Chang's niece-in-law).

---

## Why Lisa Su matters

Su transformed AMD from near-bankruptcy to credible NVIDIA competitor:

| Achievement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| AMD turnaround | From $2 to $150+ stock |
| Zen architecture | Competitive with Intel |
| MI300 series | First serious NVIDIA AI challenger |
| Xilinx acquisition | FPGA capabilities |

---

## AMD turnaround

**When Su took over (2014):**
- AMD near bankruptcy
- Intel dominant in CPUs
- No AI play

**Now:**
- Market cap ~$200B+
- Taking Intel CPU share
- MI300X challenging H100
- Data center growing rapidly

---

## NVIDIA challenge

**MI300X (2024):**
- 192GB HBM3 (more than H100)
- Competitive performance on inference
- Software (ROCm) still behind CUDA

**The gap:**
- CUDA ecosystem is the moat
- ROCm improving but not at parity
- Customers hesitant to switch
- "Mental moat" — perception that only NVIDIA works

**Strategy:** Target inference (less CUDA-dependent) before training.

---

## TSMC connection

**Family tie:** Lisa Su is Morris Chang's niece by marriage (married to Morris Chang's nephew).

**What this means:**
- Personal relationship with TSMC leadership
- AMD gets good capacity allocation
- But NVIDIA/Apple still priority

---

## Acquisitions

| Target | Year | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Xilinx | 2022 | FPGAs, $49B |
| Pensando | 2022 | DPUs |
| Nod.ai | 2023 | AI compiler |
| Silo AI | 2024 | European AI lab |

**Pattern:** Building AI software stack to challenge CUDA.

---

## Leadership style

- Engineering background (MIT PhD)
- Technical credibility
- Less flashy than Jensen, more operational
- Patient, methodical turnaround

---

## Intel contrast

While Intel struggled:
- Su executed Zen roadmap
- Took CPU market share
- Pivoted to AI before Intel
- Didn't get distracted by foundry

---

## xAI investment

AMD invested in [[xAI]] (Dec 2024 round) — strategic relationship with Musk entities.

---

## Risks / Considerations

- CUDA moat may be insurmountable
- ROCm software gap
- NVIDIA acquires competitors (Groq)
- HBM supply constraints affect AMD too

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | AMD CEO (since 2014) |
| AMD market cap | ~$200B+ |
| Education | MIT PhD (electrical engineering) |
| TSMC connection | Morris Chang's niece by marriage |
