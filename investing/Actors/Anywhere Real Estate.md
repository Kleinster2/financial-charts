## Why acquired

**For Anywhere:**
- High debt load unsustainable in weak market
- Premium brands but subscale technology
- 84% premium vs struggling stock

**For Compass:**
- Instant scale (18% combined market share)
- Brand portfolio (luxury via Sotheby's/Corcoran)
- Franchise recurring revenue
- $225M synergy opportunity

## Legacy context

**Realogy history:**
- 2006: Spun from Cendant
- 2007: Taken private by Apollo for $6.6B (peak LBO timing)
- 2012: IPO'd as Realogy
- 2022: Rebranded to Anywhere Real Estate
- 2026: Acquired by Compass

Survived financial crisis, COVID, rate shock — ultimately sold at premium to tech-forward competitor.

## Investment implications

No longer separately investable. See [[Compass]] for combined entity.

Key question: Can Compass integrate brands without destroying franchise value?
