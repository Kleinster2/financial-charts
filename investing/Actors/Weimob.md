## Investment case

Bull:
- First profit since 2021 — turnaround inflection
- WeChat commerce ecosystem is massive and growing
- Multi-platform expansion (Douyin, Taobao, Meituan) reduces WeChat dependency
- AI products (WAI, WIME) creating new revenue stream
- RMB 18B in ad facilitation shows scale of merchant base
- Smart Retail growing organically (+5.2%)

Bear:
- FY2024 revenue -40% — steep decline even with adjustments
- History of heavy losses (RMB 1.8B loss in 2022)
- Highly dependent on Tencent/WeChat ecosystem
- Competes directly with [[Youzan]] in same niche
- 62,924 paying merchants — small base for HK$8.5B market cap
- Database sabotage in 2020 raised operational resilience questions
