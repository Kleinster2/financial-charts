**Ant Group** (蚂蚁集团) — China's largest fintech company. Operator of Alipay (1.3B users). Poster child for Beijing's tech crackdown after its record $37B IPO was killed in 2020. Now pivoting from payments to AI + healthcare.

## Why Ant Group matters

Ant is simultaneously:
1. **The world's largest fintech** (by users) — Alipay dominates Chinese payments
2. **A cautionary regulatory tale** — the IPO halt reshaped global tech investing in China
3. **An AI pivot story** — pivoting from payments to AI healthcare, robotics, and global expansion

## The IPO that wasn't (2020)

**Timeline:**
- Ant planned dual listing (Shanghai + Hong Kong) — $37B raise
- Would have been world's largest IPO ever
- Valued Ant at ~$315B
- [[Jack Ma]]'s Bund Speech (Oct 24, 2020) criticized regulators
- Xi Jinping personally ordered IPO halted (Nov 3, 2020)
- Triggered multi-year tech crackdown across all Chinese tech

**Aftermath:**
- Forced to restructure as financial holding company (bank-like regulation)
- $985M fine from PBOC (Jul 2023)
- Jack Ma removed as controlling shareholder (2024)
- Valuation collapsed from ~$315B to ~$78B (Ant's own buyback price, 2023)

## AI pivot (2025–2026)

Post-crackdown, Ant is reinventing itself beyond payments:

| **AI healthcare** | Betting on China's $69B AI health sector |

## Investment relevance

**Not publicly traded** — but matters because:
- [[Alibaba]] holds 33% stake (significant to BABA valuation)
- Ant International IPO could unlock value
- Regulatory template for all China tech
- AI pivot creates new growth vectors

**Bull:** AI healthcare pivot + global expansion + potential Ant International IPO
**Bear:** Regulatory overhang, Jack Ma removed, valuation destroyed, payments commoditizing
