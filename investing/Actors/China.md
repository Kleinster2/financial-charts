## Macro snapshot

### GDP

| Year | Target | Actual | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2025 Full Year | 5.0% | **5.0%** | Hit target |
| 2025 Q4 | — | **4.5%** | Weakest in 3 years |
| 2026 (Fitch) | — | 4.1% | Forecast |
| 2026 (DB) | — | 4.5% | Forecast |

### Investment collapse (Jan 2026)

| Metric | 2025 | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Fixed-asset investment | **-3.8%** | First annual decline in decades |
| Property investment | **-17.2%** | 4th consecutive year of decline |
| Residential sales | ¥7.3T | Lowest since 2015 |
| Dec retail sales | **+0.9%** | Slowest since late 2022 |

**Fitch warning:** Investment crash raising credit risks for homebuilders, banks, and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).

### Cement collapse (Jan 2026)

Cement tells the construction story most clearly — after decades of growth, China's construction-driven economy has structurally peaked. See [[Cement]] for industry dynamics and why cement behaves differently from other commodities.

![[china-cement-vs-building-starts.png]]
*[[Cement]]*
*Building starts collapsed to 2003 levels; cement output still 2x higher — more decline ahead.*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China share of global | ~50% |
| Decline since 2020 | **-30%** |
| 2026 outlook | 6th consecutive year of decline |
| Peak per-capita (2014) | 1.8 tons |
| Current per-capita | ~1.2 tons (4x global avg) |
| Capacity utilization | ~50% |
| Prices | Decade lows |

**Projection:** At 4%/year decline, China produces 350M fewer tons by 2030 — no other market can replace this shortfall.

### Monetary policy

**PBOC:** Held 1-year and 5-year LPR at 3%/3.5% — 8th consecutive month unchanged.

### Stimulus (Jan 2026)

**[[NDRC]] (Wang Changlin) announced new stimulus policies:**
- Focus: **Services sector consumption** (not infrastructure/property)
- Addressing supply-demand imbalances
- Spread across 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030)

Details TBD — watch for specifics on consumer subsidies, services support.

## Why it matters

China is central to every major semiconductor thesis:
- **Demand**: Largest market for semiconductor equipment despite restrictions
- **Supply chain**: 30-45% of Korean memory production located in China
- **Policy**: Export controls reshape capex, R&D, and supply chains globally
- **Indigenous development**: $150B+ in subsidies, ASML clone efforts, mature node buildout

---

## Export control dynamics

| Policy | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **VEU (Validated End User)** | Revoked Dec 31, 2025 | TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs need case-by-case approval |
| **H200 exports** | Conditional | 25% revenue to US govt required |
| **Affiliate Rule** | Suspended 1 year | Exchange for China suspending rare earth controls |
| **Equipment sales** | Restricted but porous | Congress: China still largest equipment market |

**ITIF estimate**: Full decoupling = $77B US sales loss, 24% R&D cut

---

## Indigenous chip efforts

### Mature nodes (success)
- SMIC 7nm without EUV (multi-patterning DUV)
- Huawei Kirin 9000S in Mate 60 Pro
- Massive mature node capacity buildout

### Advanced nodes (struggling)
- **ASML clone**: Prototype in Shenzhen with former ASML engineers
  - Target: 2028-2030 production
  - Reality: Decades behind on precision engineering
- **DUV workarounds**: Extending life of older ASML tools via subsystem upgrades

### AI chips
- Huawei Ascend 910B/C competing with NVIDIA A100
- Tencent WeDLM-8B model (beats Qwen3-8B)
- Heavy stockpiling of NVIDIA chips pre-restrictions

### Huawei as national champion strategy (Jan 2026)

**[[David Sacks]] (Davos, Jan 23):** China actively blocking NVIDIA chips to indigenize chip production and stand up [[Huawei]] as national champion.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Mechanism | Keeping out competition = market subsidy for Huawei |
| Plan | Huawei dominates China first → uses scale → takes over rest of world |
| Logic | Chip production is a scale-up business — domestic dominance = platform for global push |
| Parallel | Echoes Huawei telecom playbook (Trump I era) |
| Bloomberg/Reuters | Reported China not allowing NVIDIA chips into country |

**The telecom lesson ([[Michael Kratsios]], Davos):** Huawei wasn't the best technology in telecom — "certainly subpar compared to Ericsson and Nokia" — but was "good enough" and "subsidized enough" to become default for much of the world. China now applying same playbook to AI chips.

### Energy advantage (Sacks, Davos Jan 2026)

| Metric | China | US |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Grid growth (last 10 years) | **~doubled** | 2-3% |
| New power plants | New nuclear/coal plant every week | Slow permitting |
| Constraint | GPU access (export controls) | Power access (44GW gap) |

**Sacks framing:** The two countries face inverted constraints. US has best chips but can't power them. China has abundant power but can't get best chips. See [[Power constraints]] for full analysis.

## Industrial policy

### 15th Five Year Plan (2026-2030)
- Central theme: AI
- Three-stage rollout starting March 2026
- 6 target areas by 2027: research, industrial, consumer, healthcare, education, digital govt

### Big Fund (National IC Fund)
- Phase I: $20B (2014)
- Phase II: $30B (2019)
- Phase III: $47B (2024)
- Focus shifting from logic to equipment/materials

### Public sentiment / AI optimism

**Stanford polling (cited by Sacks, Davos Jan 2026):**

| Country/Region | "AI more beneficial than harmful" |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **China** | **83%** |
| **US** | **39%** |
| Asian countries | Generally high |
| Western countries | Generally low |

**Sacks's concern:** China's AI optimism = competitive advantage. Less public resistance → less regulatory friction → faster deployment. US could "shoot ourselves in the foot" with overregulation driven by low AI optimism (1,200+ state AI bills in progress).

**Possible explanations (Sacks):** (1) Western media focuses on doom/gloom, (2) Hollywood dystopian portrayals (Terminator, 2001), (3) US tech leaders talking about eliminating 50% of knowledge workers sounds dystopian.

- Less regulatory friction for deployment
- 15th Five-Year Plan explicitly pro-AI

## Exposure by company

| Company | China exposure | Risk |
|---------|---------------|------|
| **SK Hynix** | 30-35% DRAM, 40-45% NAND | VEU expiry, fab licensing |
| **Samsung** | Major fab presence | VEU expiry, equipment limits |
| **NVIDIA** | Was ~25% revenue | Mostly lost, H200 partial recovery |
| **AMD** | Growing (MI308) | Regulatory uncertainty |
| **ASML** | DUV sales ongoing | Clone threat, tighter controls coming |
| **Applied Materials** | Significant | Service restrictions |

## 2025 trade performance

**Record $1.2T surplus despite Trump tariffs:**

| Metric | 2025 | YoY |
|--------|------|-----|
| Trade surplus | **$1.189T** | +20% |
| Exports | $3.77T | +5.5% |
| Imports | $2.58T | Flat |

**Export destination pivot (full year 2025):**

| Region | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **US** | **-20%** | Tariff impact |
| Africa | +26% | Fastest growth |
| ASEAN | +13% | Supply chain relocation |
| EU | +8% | Steady growth |
| LatAm | +7% | New markets |

**Key categories:**
- Autos: +21% (7M+ units, driven by EVs)
- Mechanical/electrical: +8.4%
- Declining: furniture, clothing, shoes

**Strategic response:** Chinese exporters restructured supply chains — shifted lower-end manufacturing to third countries (SE Asia) facing lower US tariffs.

**Africa = fastest growing destination:** Exports +26%, $348B total trade. Belt & Road investment in Africa hit $39B in H1 2025 (#1 destination). See [[China-Africa trade]].

## Rare earth leverage

China controls 60-70% of rare earth processing. Used as counter-leverage:
- Gallium/germanium export controls (Aug 2023)
- Suspended in exchange for Affiliate Rule suspension (Dec 2025)
- Potential escalation tool if trade war intensifies

---

## H200 chip restrictions (Jan 2026)

**"Basically a ban"** — China customs told agents H200 chips not permitted (Jan 14, 2026).

| Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Directive | "Not permitted" — customs agents instructed to block |
| Exceptions | "Special circumstances" (university R&D only) |
| Wording | "So severe that it is basically a ban for now" |
| Background | Trump allowed H200 with 25% fee in Dec 2025 |

**Strategic logic:** Beijing needs domestic chip demand to fund Huawei Ascend development. Blocking foreign chips forces reliance on Chinese alternatives.

See [[Export controls]] for US policy context.

---

## Cybersecurity software ban (Jan 2026)

**Directive:** Replace all US/Israeli cybersecurity software with domestic alternatives by **H1 2026**.

**US firms banned:** VMware, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, McAfee, Recorded Future, Claroty, Rapid7, Wiz

**Israeli firms banned:** Check Point, CyberArk, Orca Security, Cato Networks, Imperva (Thales)

**Rationale:** Fear software could collect and transmit confidential information abroad.

See [[China cybersecurity ban]] for full analysis.

## 2026 tariff plan (935 items)

**Effective Jan 1, 2026.** First implementation of 15th Five-Year Plan.

**Three strategic pillars:**

| Pillar | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Tech self-sufficiency** | CNC hydraulic cushions, composite contact strips, intelligent bionic robots |
| **Green transition** | Li-ion battery recycled black powder (6.5%→3%), unroasted pyrite (1%→0%) |
| **Healthcare** | Artificial blood vessels, infectious disease diagnostic kits |

**New tariff lines:** Bio-aviation kerosene, under-forest ginseng. Total: 8,972 lines.

**Signal:** "Not broad trade liberalization — targeted opening for industrial self-reliance."

## AI IPO surge (Jan 2026)

Chinese tech stocks testing how far AI-fueled rally can run. Key listings:

| Company | Event | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Shanghai Biren Technology | HK IPO (Jan 2026) | **+120%** on debut, raised $717M — AI chip designer |
| Baidu AI chip unit (Kunlun) | Filed confidentially | HK listing planned |
| MiniMax Group | Expected H1 2026 | AI foundation model startup |
| Zhipu AI | Expected H1 2026 | AI foundation model startup |

**Open-source AI strategy gaining global traction:** [[Meta]] reportedly using Alibaba's Qwen model in training for new model (code-named "Avocado"). Chinese firms' embrace of open source earning goodwill despite geopolitical antagonism.

**Policy context:** Central economic work conference + 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) put AI at center of economic agenda. "Policy-driven growth" — AI for industrial upgrading, not just consumer apps.

**Consumer sentiment headwind:** ~100M fewer credit cards since Sep 2022. Policy focus on consumption, but households remain cautious.

## Humanoid robotics push

**First humanoid robot retail store** opened in Wuhan (Jan 2026) — robots + AI gadgets in "living showroom." Motion-capture calligraphy training demos.

**CES 2026 dominance:** 21 of 38 humanoid exhibitors at CES were Chinese. 7,705 humanoid-related patents filed in 5 years (vs US 1,561). Over 150 humanoid robot companies in China.

**Humanoid Robot Games:** Soccer, running, boxing events — building public engagement with robotics technology.

**Strategic logic:** China racing to boost productivity amid rapidly aging workforce (population -3.39M in 2025, only 7.92M births). Humanoid robots as manufacturing labor substitute aligns with demographic crisis.

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | N-2 rule protects Taiwan lead, but limits overseas expansion |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Korean fabs in China face same VEU issues |
| [[Long WFE]] | China drives equipment demand, but restrictions limit upside |
| [[Long memory]] | China fabs supply-constrained = tighter global market |

---

## What to watch

- [ ] VEU case-by-case approval patterns (Q1 2026)
- [ ] ASML clone progress updates
- [ ] 15th Five Year Plan semiconductor specifics (March 2026)
- [ ] Rare earth policy changes
- [ ] Huawei Ascend adoption in Chinese cloud

---

## Counter-argument

Bulls on China exposure would say:
- Restrictions are porous — equipment still flowing
- China demand too large to ignore
- Indigenous efforts will take 10+ years to mature
- Political cycles change — restrictions could ease
