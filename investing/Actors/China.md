# China

State actor shaping semiconductor industry through industrial policy, export control responses, and domestic chip development. Both largest customer and primary geopolitical constraint.

---

## Why it matters

China is central to every major semiconductor thesis:
- **Demand**: Largest market for semiconductor equipment despite restrictions
- **Supply chain**: 30-45% of Korean memory production located in China
- **Policy**: Export controls reshape capex, R&D, and supply chains globally
- **Indigenous development**: $150B+ in subsidies, ASML clone efforts, mature node buildout

---

## Export control dynamics

| Policy | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **VEU (Validated End User)** | Revoked Dec 31, 2025 | TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs need case-by-case approval |
| **H200 exports** | Conditional | 25% revenue to US govt required |
| **Affiliate Rule** | Suspended 1 year | Exchange for China suspending rare earth controls |
| **Equipment sales** | Restricted but porous | Congress: China still largest equipment market |

**ITIF estimate**: Full decoupling = $77B US sales loss, 24% R&D cut

---

## Indigenous chip efforts

### Mature nodes (success)
- SMIC 7nm without EUV (multi-patterning DUV)
- Huawei Kirin 9000S in Mate 60 Pro
- Massive mature node capacity buildout

### Advanced nodes (struggling)
- **ASML clone**: Prototype in Shenzhen with former ASML engineers
  - Target: 2028-2030 production
  - Reality: Decades behind on precision engineering
- **DUV workarounds**: Extending life of older ASML tools via subsystem upgrades

### AI chips
- Huawei Ascend 910B/C competing with NVIDIA A100
- Tencent WeDLM-8B model (beats Qwen3-8B)
- Heavy stockpiling of NVIDIA chips pre-restrictions

---

## Industrial policy

### 15th Five Year Plan (2026-2030)
- Central theme: AI
- Three-stage rollout starting March 2026
- 6 target areas by 2027: research, industrial, consumer, healthcare, education, digital govt

### Big Fund (National IC Fund)
- Phase I: $20B (2014)
- Phase II: $30B (2019)
- Phase III: $47B (2024)
- Focus shifting from logic to equipment/materials

### Public sentiment
- Chinese citizens significantly more trusting of AI/tech sector than US/EU
- Less regulatory friction for deployment

## Exposure by company

| Company | China exposure | Risk |
|---------|---------------|------|
| **SK Hynix** | 30-35% DRAM, 40-45% NAND | VEU expiry, fab licensing |
| **Samsung** | Major fab presence | VEU expiry, equipment limits |
| **NVIDIA** | Was ~25% revenue | Mostly lost, H200 partial recovery |
| **AMD** | Growing (MI308) | Regulatory uncertainty |
| **ASML** | DUV sales ongoing | Clone threat, tighter controls coming |
| **Applied Materials** | Significant | Service restrictions |

## 2025 trade performance

**Record $1.2T surplus despite Trump tariffs:**

| Metric | 2025 | YoY |
|--------|------|-----|
| Trade surplus | **$1.189T** | +20% |
| Exports | $3.77T | +5.5% |
| Imports | $2.58T | Flat |

**Export destination pivot (full year 2025):**

| Region | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **US** | **-20%** | Tariff impact |
| Africa | +26% | Fastest growth |
| ASEAN | +13% | Supply chain relocation |
| EU | +8% | Steady growth |
| LatAm | +7% | New markets |

**Key categories:**
- Autos: +21% (7M+ units, driven by EVs)
- Mechanical/electrical: +8.4%
- Declining: furniture, clothing, shoes

**Strategic response:** Chinese exporters restructured supply chains — shifted lower-end manufacturing to third countries (SE Asia) facing lower US tariffs.

**Africa = fastest growing destination:** Exports +26%, $348B total trade. Belt & Road investment in Africa hit $39B in H1 2025 (#1 destination). See [[China-Africa trade]].

## Rare earth leverage

China controls 60-70% of rare earth processing. Used as counter-leverage:
- Gallium/germanium export controls (Aug 2023)
- Suspended in exchange for Affiliate Rule suspension (Dec 2025)
- Potential escalation tool if trade war intensifies

## H200 chip restrictions (Jan 2026)

**"Basically a ban"** — China customs told agents H200 chips not permitted (Jan 14, 2026).

| Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Directive | "Not permitted" — customs agents instructed to block |
| Exceptions | "Special circumstances" (university R&D only) |
| Wording | "So severe that it is basically a ban for now" |
| Background | Trump allowed H200 with 25% fee in Dec 2025 |

**Strategic logic:** Beijing needs domestic chip demand to fund Huawei Ascend development. Blocking foreign chips forces reliance on Chinese alternatives.

See [[Export controls]] for US policy context.

---

## Cybersecurity software ban (Jan 2026)

**Directive:** Replace all US/Israeli cybersecurity software with domestic alternatives by **H1 2026**.

**US firms banned:** VMware, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, McAfee, Recorded Future, Claroty, Rapid7, Wiz

**Israeli firms banned:** Check Point, CyberArk, Orca Security, Cato Networks, Imperva (Thales)

**Rationale:** Fear software could collect and transmit confidential information abroad.

See [[China cybersecurity ban]] for full analysis.

## 2026 tariff plan (935 items)

**Effective Jan 1, 2026.** First implementation of 15th Five-Year Plan.

**Three strategic pillars:**

| Pillar | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Tech self-sufficiency** | CNC hydraulic cushions, composite contact strips, intelligent bionic robots |
| **Green transition** | Li-ion battery recycled black powder (6.5%→3%), unroasted pyrite (1%→0%) |
| **Healthcare** | Artificial blood vessels, infectious disease diagnostic kits |

**New tariff lines:** Bio-aviation kerosene, under-forest ginseng. Total: 8,972 lines.

**Signal:** "Not broad trade liberalization — targeted opening for industrial self-reliance."

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | N-2 rule protects Taiwan lead, but limits overseas expansion |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Korean fabs in China face same VEU issues |
| [[Long WFE]] | China drives equipment demand, but restrictions limit upside |
| [[Long memory]] | China fabs supply-constrained = tighter global market |

## What to watch

- [ ] VEU case-by-case approval patterns (Q1 2026)
- [ ] ASML clone progress updates
- [ ] 15th Five Year Plan semiconductor specifics (March 2026)
- [ ] Rare earth policy changes
- [ ] Huawei Ascend adoption in Chinese cloud

---

## Counter-argument

Bulls on China exposure would say:
- Restrictions are porous — equipment still flowing
- China demand too large to ignore
- Indigenous efforts will take 10+ years to mature
- Political cycles change — restrictions could ease
