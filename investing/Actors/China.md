# China

State actor shaping semiconductor industry through industrial policy, export control responses, and domestic chip development. Both largest customer and primary geopolitical constraint.

---

## Why it matters

China is central to every major semiconductor thesis:
- **Demand**: Largest market for semiconductor equipment despite restrictions
- **Supply chain**: 30-45% of Korean memory production located in China
- **Policy**: Export controls reshape capex, R&D, and supply chains globally
- **Indigenous development**: $150B+ in subsidies, ASML clone efforts, mature node buildout

---

## Export control dynamics

| Policy | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **VEU (Validated End User)** | Revoked Dec 31, 2025 | TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs need case-by-case approval |
| **H200 exports** | Conditional | 25% revenue to US govt required |
| **Affiliate Rule** | Suspended 1 year | Exchange for China suspending rare earth controls |
| **Equipment sales** | Restricted but porous | Congress: China still largest equipment market |

**ITIF estimate**: Full decoupling = $77B US sales loss, 24% R&D cut

## Indigenous chip efforts

### Mature nodes (success)
- SMIC 7nm without EUV (multi-patterning DUV)
- Huawei Kirin 9000S in Mate 60 Pro
- Massive mature node capacity buildout

### Advanced nodes (struggling)
- **ASML clone**: Prototype in Shenzhen with former ASML engineers
  - Target: 2028-2030 production
  - Reality: Decades behind on precision engineering
- **DUV workarounds**: Extending life of older ASML tools via subsystem upgrades

### AI chips
- Huawei Ascend 910B/C competing with NVIDIA A100
- Tencent WeDLM-8B model (beats Qwen3-8B)
- Heavy stockpiling of NVIDIA chips pre-restrictions

---

## Industrial policy

### 15th Five Year Plan (2026-2030)
- Central theme: AI
- Three-stage rollout starting March 2026
- 6 target areas by 2027: research, industrial, consumer, healthcare, education, digital govt

### Big Fund (National IC Fund)
- Phase I: $20B (2014)
- Phase II: $30B (2019)
- Phase III: $47B (2024)
- Focus shifting from logic to equipment/materials

### Public sentiment
- Chinese citizens significantly more trusting of AI/tech sector than US/EU
- Less regulatory friction for deployment

## Exposure by company

| Company | China exposure | Risk |
|---------|---------------|------|
| **SK Hynix** | 30-35% DRAM, 40-45% NAND | VEU expiry, fab licensing |
| **Samsung** | Major fab presence | VEU expiry, equipment limits |
| **NVIDIA** | Was ~25% revenue | Mostly lost, H200 partial recovery |
| **AMD** | Growing (MI308) | Regulatory uncertainty |
| **ASML** | DUV sales ongoing | Clone threat, tighter controls coming |
| **Applied Materials** | Significant | Service restrictions |

## Rare earth leverage

China controls 60-70% of rare earth processing. Used as counter-leverage:
- Gallium/germanium export controls (Aug 2023)
- Suspended in exchange for Affiliate Rule suspension (Dec 2025)
- Potential escalation tool if trade war intensifies

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | N-2 rule protects Taiwan lead, but limits overseas expansion |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Korean fabs in China face same VEU issues |
| [[Long WFE]] | China drives equipment demand, but restrictions limit upside |
| [[Long memory]] | China fabs supply-constrained = tighter global market |

## What to watch

- [ ] VEU case-by-case approval patterns (Q1 2026)
- [ ] ASML clone progress updates
- [ ] 15th Five Year Plan semiconductor specifics (March 2026)
- [ ] Rare earth policy changes
- [ ] Huawei Ascend adoption in Chinese cloud

---

## Counter-argument

Bulls on China exposure would say:
- Restrictions are porous — equipment still flowing
- China demand too large to ignore
- Indigenous efforts will take 10+ years to mature
- Political cycles change — restrictions could ease
