## SOXX vs SMH

| | SOXX | SMH |
|--|------|-----|
| AUM | $18B | $37B |
| Top holding | NVDA 8% | NVDA 21% |
| Concentration | Lower | High |
| Includes TSM | No | Yes (10%) |

**Key difference:** SOXX excludes [[TSMC]] (not US-listed). More equal-weighted approach means less NVIDIA dominance but also less exposure to the AI trade's biggest winner.

## Use Case

Alternative semiconductor benchmark. Use SOXX when you want to compare against a more diversified chip basket, or when TSM exposure would distort the comparison.
