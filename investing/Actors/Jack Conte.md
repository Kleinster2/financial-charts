## Origin story

Conte was a YouTube musician — Pomplamoose had millions of views but ad revenue was minimal. The disconnect between audience size and income inspired Patreon: let fans pay creators directly.

Co-founded Patreon in 2013 with Stanford roommate **Sam Yam** (engineer).

## Patreon journey

- **2013:** Founded Patreon
- **2021:** Peak $4B valuation
- **2022:** Laid off 17% of staff, valuation dropped 70%
- **2025:** Exploring IPO options

Still CEO — one of few founder-CEOs to survive a 70% valuation reset.

## Philosophy

Built Patreon around creator-friendly economics (5-12% take rate vs industry 20-50%). Believes direct fan support is more sustainable than ad revenue for most creators.
