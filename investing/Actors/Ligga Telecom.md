## Context

Tanure acquired Copel Telecom in 2020, issuing R$1.5B in debt and pledging shares across multiple portfolio companies as collateral. He repaid the principal over time, but accrued interest brought the outstanding balance to ~R$1.3B. [[Banco Master]]'s liquidation (Nov 2025) froze cash that Tanure's companies held in Master CDBs. The creditor consortium executed collateral guarantees on Feb 7, 2026, seizing shares in [[Alianca Saude]], [[Light SA]], and other holdings. The Ligga stake itself has not yet been seized; a sale to Brasil Tech is being negotiated, and creditors are allowing the deal to proceed.
