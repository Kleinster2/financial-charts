## Venezuela position

**Owed $12B — cautious on return:**

At [[WH oil executives Venezuela meeting 2026-01-09]]:

When Trump noted ConocoPhillips's $12B arbitration claim, Lance quipped: **"It's already been written off."** Trump joked back: "Good writeoff."

**Context:** ConocoPhillips exited Venezuela in 2007 after refusing Chavez nationalization. Seeking $12B arbitration award. Would need major changes before committing new capital.
