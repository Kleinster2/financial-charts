## Legacy at Apollo

Black shaped Apollo's DNA as an aggressive, contrarian investor. The firm's distressed-debt heritage — buying assets others feared — came from his Drexel training under Milken. But Apollo's transformation into a credit/insurance powerhouse happened under Rowan, not Black. By the time Black departed, the firm was already pivoting away from its PE roots toward the Athene-powered model.
