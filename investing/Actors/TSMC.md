**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company** — the world's dominant pure-play logic foundry (~60% market share).

## Core thesis

TSMC operates as a capital-disciplined monopolist. Its strategy: protect and compound the manufacturing monopoly through [[Yield as competitive moat|yield maturity]], [[Customer lock-in via co-design|ecosystem lock-in]], and predictable execution.

## Key concepts

- [[Why TSMC can afford patience]] — positional advantage enables discipline
- [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] — the real moat beyond yields
- [[Node lag as strategy]] — overseas fabs intentionally trail Taiwan
- [[Taiwan concentration risk]] — the elephant in the room
- [[Advanced packaging]] — CoWoS monopoly, another moat beyond foundry

## Key events

- **Q4 2024 record revenue** (Jan 2025) — NT$1,046B (~$33B), first quarter above NT$1T. Beat consensus by ~1%. YoY +20%, gross margin 59%. AI demand driving.
- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] — U.S. geographic diversification
- **Kumamoto Fab 2 pivot** (Dec 2025) — Scrapping 6nm plan, jumping to 2nm for autonomous/AI. JASM posted NT$6.2B loss H1 2025 vs Arizona's NT$4.7B profit.
- **Nanjing VEU expiring Dec 31** — TSMC dismisses concerns, says Chinese clients can access advanced nodes globally. Xiaomi 3nm chip as proof.

## Open questions

- [[How durable is TSMC's moat]]
- [[What happens if Taiwan is disrupted]]

## Competitive context

- vs [[Samsung]]: disciplined incumbent vs aggressive challenger
- vs [[Intel Foundry Services]]: pure-play vs transforming IDM

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market share | **71%** (Q3 2025) |
| Leading edge | 2nm ramping 2025 |
| U.S. investment | $65-165B (Arizona) |
| CHIPS Act | $6.6B |

## 3nm node family

TSMC's 3nm is not one process — it's a family optimized for different use cases:

| Node | Focus | Trade-offs | Status |
|------|-------|------------|--------|
| **N3E** | Baseline 3nm | Balanced PPA | Production |
| **N3P** | Performance Enhanced | +5% vs N3E, -10% power, +4% density | Production |
| **N3X** | High-Performance Computing | +5% vs N3P, max clocks, >1.0V | **First commercial: [[Qualcomm]] X2** |

**N3X specifics:**
- Optimized for clock speed over efficiency
- Higher voltage operation (>1.0V)
- Lower density vs N3P
- Lower efficiency vs N3P
- Target: desktop/laptop chips that can tolerate power draw

**Who uses what:**
- [[Apple]]: N3E/N3P (efficiency-first for laptops/phones)
- [[Qualcomm]]: N3X (Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme — performance-first)
- AI accelerators: Likely N3P (balance of performance and density)

**Implications:** TSMC can tune the same node generation for different customers. Not all "3nm" chips are equal.

## Pricing power (two eras)

| Era | ASP CAGR | COGS → ASP | Marginal profit |
|-----|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 2005-2019 | 0.1% | $1 → $1.43 | $0.43 |
| 2019-2025 | 15.2% | $1 → $2.31 | $1.31 |

Post-2019: ASP +133%, COGS +78%, gross profit per wafer expanded 3.3x.

**Drivers:**
- Scarcity premium (capacity constrained)
- EUV-based advanced nodes
- Higher HPC/AI mix
- Advanced packaging (CoWoS)

**Key insight**: Rising COGS actually benefits TSMC — discourages competition, widens the moat. Complexity is a feature, not a bug.

**Dec 2025 pricing announcement:**
- Annual price hikes starting Jan 1, 2026 through 2029
- 2026: +3-10% depending on process node
- Drivers: tight sub-3nm capacity, sustained AI demand
- Stock hit record NT$1,530 on news

This is monopolist behavior — customers accept because there's no alternative.

## Market expectations

What consensus assumes (update when you see estimates):

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2nm yields | 75%+ at maturity | |
| Arizona timeline | On schedule | |
| 2024 revenue growth | +20% YoY (Q4) | Jan 2025 |
| Gross margin | 59% (Q4 2024) | Jan 2025 |
| **2026 revenue growth** | **30%** (Street), **25-30%** (likely guide) | Susquehanna Jan 2026 |

**Priced in:**
- Continued dominance at leading edge
- Arizona execution (no major delays)
- Apple/NVIDIA as locked customers

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Taiwan disruption
- N-2 rule relaxation
- Major customer defection
- Arizona yields matching Taiwan faster than expected

## Q4 2025 earnings preview (Jan 16, 2026)

**Susquehanna (Mehdi Hosseini)** — Positive rating, caution on near-term guidance.

| Metric | Street expects | Likely guidance |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2026 revenue growth | 30% | 25-30% |

**The setup**: Hosseini expects guidance "may disappoint some investors" but notes TSMC's historical "beat and raise" pattern — initial guidance followed by upward revisions in April/July calls.

**His advice**: "Stay focused on TSM's EPS power" rather than top-line guidance.

**Stock**: $325.92 ADR, +55% over 12 months.

## For theses

- [[Long TSMC]] — co-design moat deeper than node leadership
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — the "short" leg; high expectations, Taiwan risk
- [[Long Apple]] — Apple relationship proves co-design depth
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — CoWoS packaging is a bottleneck, but TSMC controls it (not pure OSAT play)
