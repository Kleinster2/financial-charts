**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company** — the world's dominant pure-play logic foundry (~60% market share).

## Core thesis

TSMC operates as a capital-disciplined monopolist. Its strategy: protect and compound the manufacturing monopoly through [[Yield as competitive moat|yield maturity]], [[Customer lock-in via co-design|ecosystem lock-in]], and predictable execution.

## Key concepts

- [[Why TSMC can afford patience]] — positional advantage enables discipline
- [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] — the real moat beyond yields
- [[Node lag as strategy]] — overseas fabs intentionally trail Taiwan
- [[Taiwan concentration risk]] — the elephant in the room
- [[Advanced packaging]] — CoWoS monopoly, another moat beyond foundry

## Key events

- **US-Taiwan trade deal** (Jan 15, 2026) — Part of [[US-Taiwan relations]] breakthrough. TSMC bought hundreds of acres adjacent to Arizona site for potential Phase 4+ expansion. $500B total Taiwan chip investment framework ($250B direct + $250B credit guarantees). Tariffs cut to 15%.
- **Q4 2025 earnings** (Jan 16, 2026) — NT$505.7B ($16B) net income, beat estimates. FY2025 revenue >$100B (first time ever). 2026 capex guidance $52-56B (≥25% growth), revenue growth ~30%.
- **Q4 2024 record revenue** (Jan 2025) — NT$1,046B (~$33B), first quarter above NT$1T. Beat consensus by ~1%. YoY +20%, gross margin 59%. AI demand driving.
- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] — U.S. geographic diversification (land buy Jan 2026)
- **Kumamoto Fab 2 pivot** (Dec 2025) — Scrapping 6nm plan, jumping to 2nm for autonomous/AI. JASM posted NT$6.2B loss H1 2025 vs Arizona's NT$4.7B profit.
- **Nanjing VEU expiring Dec 31** — TSMC dismisses concerns, says Chinese clients can access advanced nodes globally. Xiaomi 3nm chip as proof.

## Open questions

- [[How durable is TSMC's moat]]
- [[What happens if Taiwan is disrupted]]

## Competitive context

- vs [[Samsung]]: disciplined incumbent vs aggressive challenger
- vs [[Intel Foundry Services]]: pure-play vs transforming IDM

## 3nm node family

TSMC's 3nm is not one process — it's a family optimized for different use cases:

| Node | Focus | Trade-offs | Status |
|------|-------|------------|--------|
| **N3E** | Baseline 3nm | Balanced PPA | Production |
| **N3P** | Performance Enhanced | +5% vs N3E, -10% power, +4% density | Production |
| **N3X** | High-Performance Computing | +5% vs N3P, max clocks, >1.0V | **First commercial: [[Qualcomm]] X2** |

**N3X specifics:**
- Optimized for clock speed over efficiency
- Higher voltage operation (>1.0V)
- Lower density vs N3P
- Lower efficiency vs N3P
- Target: desktop/laptop chips that can tolerate power draw

**Who uses what:**
- [[Apple]]: N3E/N3P (efficiency-first for laptops/phones)
- [[Qualcomm]]: N3X (Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme — performance-first)
- AI accelerators: Likely N3P (balance of performance and density)

**Implications:** TSMC can tune the same node generation for different customers. Not all "3nm" chips are equal.

## Pricing power (two eras)

| Era | ASP CAGR | COGS → ASP | Marginal profit |
|-----|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 2005-2019 | 0.1% | $1 → $1.43 | $0.43 |
| 2019-2025 | 15.2% | $1 → $2.31 | $1.31 |

Post-2019: ASP +133%, COGS +78%, gross profit per wafer expanded 3.3x.

**Drivers:**
- Scarcity premium (capacity constrained)
- EUV-based advanced nodes
- Higher HPC/AI mix
- Advanced packaging (CoWoS)

**Key insight**: Rising COGS actually benefits TSMC — discourages competition, widens the moat. Complexity is a feature, not a bug.

**Dec 2025 pricing announcement:**
- Annual price hikes starting Jan 1, 2026 through 2029
- 2026: +3-10% depending on process node
- Drivers: tight sub-3nm capacity, sustained AI demand
- Stock hit record NT$1,530 on news

This is monopolist behavior — customers accept because there's no alternative.

## Market expectations

What consensus assumes (update when you see estimates):

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2nm yields | 75%+ at maturity | |
| Arizona timeline | On schedule | |
| 2024 revenue growth | +20% YoY (Q4) | Jan 2025 |
| Gross margin | 59% (Q4 2024) | Jan 2025 |
| **2026 revenue growth** | **30%** (Street), **25-30%** (likely guide) | Susquehanna Jan 2026 |

**Priced in:**
- Continued dominance at leading edge
- Arizona execution (no major delays)
- Apple/NVIDIA as locked customers

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Taiwan disruption
- N-2 rule relaxation
- Major customer defection
- Arizona yields matching Taiwan faster than expected

## Q4 2025 earnings (Jan 16, 2026)

**Results beat, guidance beats Street expectations:**

| Metric | Value | vs Expect |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Q4 Net income** | NT$505.7B ($16B) | Beat |
| Q4 Revenue | $33.1B | (reported earlier) |
| **FY2025 Revenue** | **>$100B** | First time ever |
| FY2025 growth | >30% | |

**2026 Guidance (stronger than expected):**

| Metric | Guidance | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Capex** | **$52B-$56B** | Up ≥25% from 2025 |
| **Revenue growth** | **~30%** | Beats Street (consensus was 25-30%) |

**Key commentary:**
- Strong outlook = "bullish signal on AI development frenzy"
- Helps assuage concerns about sustainability of data center spending
- US investment commitment expected: up to **$165B** total
- Memory crunch headwind: smartphone shipments -11.6% expected (Macquarie)
- Plants building in Japan (2nm pivot) and Germany

**Pre-earnings (Susquehanna)**: Hosseini expected guidance "may disappoint some investors" — but TSMC beat even bullish expectations.

**Stock reaction:** Fresh all-time high ~NT$1,600+ (highlighted yellow on Bloomberg chart).

**Short interest:** ~0.5% of free float — notably LOW despite parabolic run from ~NT$400 (2023) to NT$1,600+.

### Short interest history (quarterly)

| Quarter | SI % float | Stock (TWD) | Note |
|---------|------------|-------------|------|
| **Q1 2026** | **0.5%** | NT$1,600+ | ATH, shorts capitulated |
| Q4 2025 | 0.5% | NT$1,400 | |
| Q3 2025 | 0.5% | NT$1,100 | |
| Q2 2025 | 0.4% | NT$900 | |
| Q1 2025 | 0.4% | NT$700 | AI boom accelerating |
| 2023 avg | 0.3-0.5% | NT$400-500 | Pre-AI baseline |
| 2015-19 avg | 0.2-0.5% | NT$150-300 | Established leader |
| **2010-11** | **1.5-1.7%** | NT$60-80 | Historical peak |

**The puzzle:** Stock 4x'd since 2023, yet short interest at historical lows, not highs. Parabolic runs normally attract shorts betting on mean reversion.

**What low short interest suggests:**
- Bears see no compelling catalyst — AI monopoly thesis is consensus
- Taiwan geopolitical risk NOT being actively hedged via shorting
- No one wants to fight foundry monopolist + AI demand combo

**Contrarian read:** When everyone's long and shorts have capitulated, who's left to buy? Could signal crowded positioning. But could also mean fundamental case is so bulletproof that shorting is seen as reckless.

**Watch for:** Rising short interest would signal emerging skepticism on AI demand durability or Taiwan risk being priced in.

See [[Short interest]] for broader framework on interpreting this signal.

## For theses

- [[Long TSMC]] — co-design moat deeper than node leadership
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — the "short" leg; high expectations, Taiwan risk
- [[Long Apple]] — Apple relationship proves co-design depth
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — CoWoS packaging is a bottleneck, but TSMC controls it (not pure OSAT play)
