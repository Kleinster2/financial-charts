**PayPal** — Digital payments pioneer. PayPal, Venmo, Braintree. Struggling to find growth after pandemic boom.

## Why PayPal matters

PayPal is the incumbent digital payments leader:

| Business | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| PayPal | Online checkout, P2P |
| Venmo | Social P2P payments |
| Braintree | Merchant processing |
| Xoom | International remittances |
| Honey | Shopping/coupons |

---

## Sector correlation

| Sector | Correlation | Fit |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| [[Payments Networks]] (V, MA) | 0.44-0.46 | Borderline |
| [[US Retail Trading]] (SOFI, HOOD, COIN) | 0.34-0.46 | Weak |

PYPL is loosely attached to payments networks but doesn't trade with them (V-MA at 0.86, PYPL-V at 0.44). Different business model — PYPL competes for transactions while V/MA take a toll on all transactions.

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active accounts | 430M+ |
| Payment volume | $1.5T+ annually |
| Merchants | 35M+ |
| Venmo users | 90M+ |

---

## Challenges

**Post-pandemic hangover:**
- COVID pulled forward growth
- Competition intensified ([[Apple]] Pay, Shop Pay)
- Checkout button wars (losing share)
- Venmo monetization slow
- Activist pressure (Elliott)

---

## [[Crypto]] offering

**Multi-coin approach:**
- Buy/sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, others
- PYUSD stablecoin (launched 2023)
- [[Crypto]] checkout for merchants
- Less aggressive than [[Block]]

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Massive scale (430M accounts)
- Venmo monetization opportunity
- Braintree growth
- PYUSD stablecoin potential
- Valuation compressed
- New CEO (Alex Chriss) turnaround

**Bear:**
- [[Apple]] Pay eating share
- Checkout competition (Shop Pay, etc.)
- Venmo still not profitable
- Growth deceleration
- PayPal "mafia" talent long gone

## PayPal Mafia

**Famous alumni:**

PayPal itself no longer has this talent density.
