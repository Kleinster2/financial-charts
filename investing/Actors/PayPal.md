## Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 3, 2026)

**Major miss. Stock -20%. New CEO named.**

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | **$8.68B** | $8.80B |
| EPS (adj) | **$1.23** | Higher |

**Branded checkout collapse:**
- Q4 growth decelerated to **1%** (vs 6% YoY)
- US retail weakness + international headwinds

**FY2026 guidance:** Profit to decline low-single-digits to flat — far below expectations.

**CEO change:** HP's Enrique Lores named president and CEO, effective March 1. Alex Chriss out after ~2 years.

**First dividend:** $0.14/share (ex-date March 4, payable March 25).

**The problem:** Branded checkout losing share to Apple Pay, Shop Pay. Turnaround not working.

## Checkout wars pressure

PayPal is losing the [[Checkout wars]] — the battle for who owns the checkout button.

| Competitor | Threat |
|------------|--------|
| [[Apple Pay]] | Surpassing PayPal in US online volumes (2025) |
| [[Shop Pay]] | +57% YoY growth, 200M users, taking Shopify share |
| [[Stripe]] Link | 200M users, 7-14% conversion lift |
| [[Google]] Pay | Android-native, growing |

**Why PayPal loses on friction:**
- Apple Pay: One-tap Face ID vs PayPal login
- Shop Pay: Pre-saved across 2M merchants vs PayPal redirect
- Conversion data: PayPal shows **14% lower** mobile conversion than card checkout

The branded checkout decline (1% growth Q4 2025) reflects structural share loss, not just macro weakness.

## Why PayPal matters

PayPal is the incumbent digital payments leader:

| Business | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| PayPal | Online checkout, P2P |
| Venmo | Social P2P payments |
| Braintree | Merchant processing |
| Xoom | International remittances |
| Honey | Shopping/coupons |

---

## Sector correlation

| Sector | Correlation | Fit |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| [[Payments Networks]] (V, MA) | 0.44-0.46 | Borderline |
| [[US Retail Trading]] (SOFI, HOOD, COIN) | 0.34-0.46 | Weak |

PYPL is loosely attached to payments networks but doesn't trade with them (V-MA at 0.86, PYPL-V at 0.44). Different business model — PYPL competes for transactions while V/MA take a toll on all transactions.

---

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active accounts | 439M |
| Payment volume | $1.5T+ annually ($475B Q4 2025) |
| Merchants | 35M+ |
| Venmo users | 90M+ |

---

## Challenges

**Post-pandemic hangover:**
- COVID pulled forward growth
- Competition intensified ([[Apple]] Pay, Shop Pay)
- Checkout button wars (losing share)
- Venmo monetization slow
- Activist pressure (Elliott)

---

## [[Crypto]] offering

**Multi-coin approach:**
- Buy/sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, others
- PYUSD stablecoin (launched 2023)
- [[Crypto]] checkout for merchants
- Less aggressive than [[Block]]

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Massive scale (439M accounts)
- Venmo monetization opportunity
- Braintree growth
- PYUSD stablecoin potential
- Valuation compressed (50% below 52-week high)
- New CEO (Enrique Lores, ex-HP) fresh start

**Bear:**
- [[Checkout wars]] structural loss — Apple Pay, Shop Pay taking share
- Branded checkout collapsed to 1% growth (Q4 2025)
- Friction disadvantage vs one-tap competitors
- Venmo still not profitable
- Growth deceleration
- PayPal "mafia" talent long gone
- Third CEO in 3 years — turnaround fatigue
- Withdrew 2027 guidance — no longer committing to investor day targets

## PayPal Mafia

**Famous alumni:**
- Elon Musk ([[Tesla]], [[SpaceX]], X)
- [[Peter Thiel]] ([[Palantir]], [[Founders Fund]])
- [[Reid Hoffman]] (LinkedIn)
- [[Max Levchin]] ([[Affirm]])
- [[David Sacks]] ([[Craft Ventures]])
- [[Keith Rabois]] (Khosla)

PayPal itself no longer has this talent density.
