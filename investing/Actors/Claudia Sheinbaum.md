## Style

More cosmopolitan than [[AMLO]] but largely same playbook on international engagement. Prioritizes functional relationship with Trump over confrontation. Privately concerned about economic stagnation (Jan 2026) but publicly downplays GDP growth as a benchmark. Morena's institutional overhaul (judicial reform, electoral rewrite) continues under her watch.
