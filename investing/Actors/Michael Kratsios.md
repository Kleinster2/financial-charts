## Davos 2026 panel (Jan 23, 2026)

Panel with [[David Sacks]] (AI/[[Crypto]] Czar), moderated by Maria Bartiromo.

### Three pillars of AI plan

1. **Out-innovate competitors** — regulatory environment that allows development and commercialization in US
2. **Drive infrastructure build** — data centers, power, compute
3. **Export American technology** — share AI stack with the world ("American AI Export Program")

### Federal vs state regulation

- Core insight: regulatory environment must allow technology to be developed AND commercialized in US
- Patchwork of 50 state rules is most detrimental to early-stage companies — big companies navigate it, startups can't
- Working on legislative proposal for national framework
- Trump's December executive order listed areas states should keep: child safety, data center permitting
- Working "closely together" with Sacks on consensus for federal framework in 2026

### American AI Export Program (detailed)

- Commerce Department closed request for information (RFI) late 2025
- Request for proposals (RFP) coming out "very shortly" (as of Jan 2026)
- Want companies to form consortia — define what "a package" looks like
- Key insight: buyers of AI worldwide vary dramatically in sophistication
  - US Fortune 500: sophisticated CIO/CTO, evaluate clouds, models, fine-tuning options
  - Most countries: just trying to figure out a tool for healthcare, tax collection, services
- Solution: "turnkey" AI packages — manageable-sized, easy to deploy
- Most countries don't need large-scale training — very few will build "colossus-style training centers"
- Most need smaller data centers with inference-related chips only
- Partnering with export finance: Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank
- Going to India next month (Feb 2026) for [[India AI]] Impact Summit — "largest global gathering for AI"
- Will share more progress on export program there

### AI for science — Genesis Mission

- Third big AI shift beyond general knowledge and coding: scientific discovery
- Challenge: science data is extraordinarily fragmented, not formatted for LLM training
- Spread across disciplines (chemistry, math, materials science) in all types of formats
- Genesis Mission: government push for "big bold leaps in AI for scientific discovery"
- National labs at DOE have 50-60 years of research data ready to be used for model training
- Dream: AI labs where you input hypothesis, lab runs experiment itself
- Goal: US could "almost double our R&D output over the next 10 years because of AI"

### Specific science breakthroughs expected

- **Fusion:** computation-heavy simulations; faster feedback loop could move fusion timelines in
- **[[Materials science]]:** testing molecules/interactions; important for space (lunar base, Mars, nuclear in space)
- **[[Healthcare]]/therapeutics:** quickly identify best molecules for health challenges, iterate to clinical trial faster

### Huawei telecom lesson (first-hand from Trump I)

- First Trump admin saw Huawei's global telecom push firsthand
- Huawei wasn't the best technology — "certainly subpar compared to [[Ericsson]] and [[Nokia]]"
- But was "good enough" and "subsidized enough" to become default telecom for much of the world
- Now [[China]] has same ambition with AI: export models to power use cases across global south
- Lesson: don't need best model for technology to "perforate globally"

### Power / data centers

- Need to share a good story about how buildout will be net positive for American ratepayers
- If you're in a small community and someone shows up to build a data center, must make clear it'll lower rates long-term
- Trump's truth post (Monday before panel): "if you're going to build a data center you have to pay your own way"
- [[Microsoft]] stepped up — hope many others will do the same
- Biden administration's policy prevented behind-the-meter energy generation — "if you wanted to bring your own power, you couldn't"
- Secretary Wright and FERC changed that rule
- Agrees with Sacks: greater scale in power generation → contributing back to grid → benefits ratepayers

### What people don't understand about AI

- Easy to underestimate long-term impact across industries and domains
- Easy to think of AI as "just a sophisticated chatbot" — that's what most people touch and feel
- Fundamental shift in velocity/pace of scientific discovery
- "Huge repercussions for the way that we as a country innovate broadly speaking in the years ahead"

### International regulatory agenda

- Sharing with partners/allies how to create regulatory environment for tech success
- [[Europe]] has "a lot of roadblocks" — Draghi report identifies issues but "things don't ever seem to change"
- Most policymakers worldwide default to precautionary principle: "whiteboard everything that could go wrong"
- US approach: "whiteboard what rules we can create to unlock innovation, what to remove"
- AB test between US and European regulatory approach over last 20 years — "recipe is kind of obvious"
- [[EU]] AI Act passed before [[ChatGPT]] invented — "shows the challenge" of regulating before innovation arrives
- Abundance story extends to healthcare, quality of life
