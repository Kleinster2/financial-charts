## Product

Core platform for legal workflows:
- Document review and contract analysis
- Legal research and case law retrieval
- Due diligence automation
- Brief and memo drafting
- Regulatory compliance

Integrations: LexisNexis, iManage, NetDocs.

Feb 2026: partnered with actor Gabriel Macht (Harvey Specter from Suits) for brand launch on Instagram.

## Competitive position

Harvey is the most-funded pure-play legal AI company. JPMorgan (Feb 2026) assessed that [[Anthropic]]'s Claude Cowork "is just catching up" with Harvey and [[RELX]], noting Cowork lacks a complete legal library.

| Competitor | Approach | Harvey advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| [[RELX]] / LexisNexis | Incumbent, complete law library, hundreds of pre-built workflows | Harvey has faster AI iteration |
| [[Legora]] | Legal AI platform, uses Anthropic/OpenAI underneath | Harvey has broader firm adoption |
| [[Luminance]] | Contract AI, cross-border governance focus | Harvey has wider product scope |
| Casetext ([[Thomson Reuters]]) | Acquired by TR | Harvey is independent |
| [[Anthropic]] (Cowork) | Horizontal AI with legal plug-ins | Harvey has domain data, audit trails, firm-specific tuning |

See [[Horizontal vs vertical AI]] for the broader generalist vs specialist debate.

## Customer base

- Majority of top 10 US law firms
- 235+ customers across 42 countries
- [[PwC]] (Big Four partnership, Mar 2023)
- [[A&O Shearman]] (first major client, Dec 2022)
- Corporate in-house legal departments

## Investment case

Bull:
- $190M revenue at high growth rates — legal TAM is massive
- Deepest Big Law penetration of any legal AI
- Domain-specific moat: audit trails, compliance, firm-specific tuning
- OpenAI strategic relationship (early GPT-4 access)
- JPMorgan endorsement vs horizontal AI threats

Bear:
- $5-8B valuation demands continued hypergrowth
- Built on OpenAI/Anthropic models — infrastructure dependency
- [[RELX]] has the complete law library Harvey lacks
- Law firm conservatism slows enterprise adoption
- Horizontal platforms keep improving — the moat narrows over time
