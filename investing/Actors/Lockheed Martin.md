## Rare earth exposure

Defense systems critically depend on rare earths:

| Application | Elements | China control |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Precision-guided munitions | Nd, Sm, Dy | ~90% |
| F-35 components | Multiple REEs | ~90% |
| Satellite systems | Nd, Pr | ~90% |
| Radar/electronics | Tb, Dy | ~99% |

**Dec 2025 military denial**: China now blocks all rare earth exports to military-affiliated companies. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Impact**:
- Forced to draw down strategic stockpiles
- Accelerating alternative sourcing (Australia, US)
- Higher input costs
- Supply chain vulnerability exposed

**Congressional response**: Rare earth provisions in defense authorization bills. But US has zero heavy rare earth separation capacity.

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for the escalation pattern.
