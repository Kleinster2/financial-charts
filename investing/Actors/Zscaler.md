- User-to-application, not network-to-network
- Cloud-native, scalable

## Q2 FY2026 (reported Feb 26, 2026)

| Metric | Q2 FY26 | Y/Y |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $815.8M | +26% |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $1.01 | Beat ($0.89 est.) |
| ARR | $3,359M | +25% |
| Net new ARR | $155.5M | — |
| Non-GAAP op margin | >22% | — |
| AI Security ARR | $400M+ | +80% Y/Y, hit FY26 target 3 quarters early |
| Zero Trust Everywhere | 450+ enterprises | Hit FY26 target 3 quarters early |

FY2026 guidance raised: ARR growth to 24%. Non-GAAP operating income $742-748M (28-29% growth).

Stock -10% AH despite clean beat — billings/deferred revenue metrics disappointed. In the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] environment, cybersecurity SaaS gets no benefit of the doubt. ZS is -37% YTD despite accelerating fundamentals. The AI Security pivot is the bright spot but market questions whether zero trust becomes commoditized by AI agents.
