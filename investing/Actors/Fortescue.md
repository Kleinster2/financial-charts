Fortescue — [[Australia]]'s third-largest [[Iron ore|iron ore]] producer, ~95% revenue from iron ore shipped to [[China]]. Founded by [[Andrew Forrest]] (36.7% owner), who built proprietary rail and port infrastructure in the Pilbara after [[BHP]] and [[Rio Tinto]] denied access. Renamed from Fortescue Metals Group in November 2023 to reflect [[Green hydrogen|green energy]] ambitions (now significantly scaled back). ASX: FMG, ADR: FSUGY.

## Why Fortescue matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | FMG (ASX) / FSUGY (OTC) |
| Market cap | ~US$47B |
| FY2025 revenue | US$15.5B |
| FY2025 NPAT | US$3.4B |
| FY2025 shipments | 198.4 Mt (record) |
| C1 hematite cost | US$17.99/wmt |
| Dividend yield | ~5% (ASX) |
| Founder stake | 36.7% ([[Andrew Forrest]]) |

Fortescue has the lowest mine-site C1 cash costs among the [[Iron ore|iron ore]] majors, but lower ore grades (57-62% Fe vs. 62-65%+ for peers) create a structural price discount that compresses realized margins.

## Price vs peers (since 2020)

![[fsugy-vs-bhp-rio-price-chart.png]]
*Fortescue has dramatically outperformed all three peers since 2020, driven by higher beta to [[Iron ore|iron ore]] price swings. [[Vale]] lagged the Pilbara miners through mid-2025 (Brumadinho/Mariana overhang) before rallying sharply. The 2024 drawdown (-37%) shows the downside of Fortescue's leverage.*

## Iron ore operations

### Mining hubs

| Hub | Key mines | Capacity | Notes |
|-----|-----------|----------|-------|
| Chichester | Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek | 100 Mtpa | Three OPFs, dry processing |
| Solomon | Firetail, Kings | ~60 Mtpa | Lowest-cost hub (US$15.8/t). Queens Valley extends life to 2064 |
| Eliwana / Western | Eliwana | 30 Mtpa | US$1.275B build incl. 143km rail. 60.1% Fe |
| Iron Bridge | Magnetite | 22 Mtpa (design) | 67% Fe concentrate. US$3.5B project. Produced 7.1 Mt in FY2025 — ramp-up ongoing |

### Production

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026 guidance |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Shipments | 191.6 Mt | 198.4 Mt (record) | 195-205 Mt |
| Total ore mined | — | 238.9 Mt (+10%) | — |
| Hematite C1 cost | US$18.93/wmt | US$17.99/wmt | US$17.50-18.50/wmt |
| Hematite avg revenue | US$104/dmt | US$85/dmt | — |

Reserves: 2.0 billion tonnes hematite ore reserves; 13.5 billion tonnes hematite mineral resources. Iron Bridge: 844 million tonnes magnetite ore reserves.

Infrastructure: proprietary rail network + port at Port Hedland. Fortescue built this from scratch after being denied access to BHP/Rio rail — a $9.2B expansion completed in 2014 that remains a major competitive asset.

## Financials

| Metric | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | US$16.9B | US$18.2B | US$15.5B |
| EBITDA | US$10.0B | US$10.7B | US$7.9B |
| EBITDA margin | 59% | 59% | 51% |
| NPAT | US$5.5B | US$5.7B | US$3.4B |
| Operating cash flow | — | US$7.9B | US$6.5B |
| Capex | — | US$2.9B | US$3.9B |
| Dividends (A$/share) | A$1.75 | A$1.97 | A$1.10 |
| Net debt | — | US$0.5B | US$1.1B |

FY2025 profit fell 41% despite record shipments — a pure [[Iron ore|iron ore]] price story. Realized hematite price dropped 18% YoY to US$85/dmt. Capex rose 34% (Iron Bridge ramp, growth projects). A$42 billion in cumulative dividends paid since 2014.

## Fortescue Energy (green division)

[[Andrew Forrest]] originally targeted 15 Mt/year of [[Green hydrogen|green hydrogen]] by 2030 and "real zero" emissions by 2030. This has been dramatically scaled back.

### Key projects

| Project | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Gibson Island | Queensland | Stalled — missed FID deadlines |
| Gladstone PEM50 | Queensland | Scrapped, ~$150M writedown |
| Phoenix Hydrogen Hub | Arizona | Scrapped after IRA grant pause |
| Holmaneset | [[Norway]] | In planning, 300 MW green ammonia |

### Strategy shifts

- July 2024: cut ~700 jobs. Scrapped 15 Mt/year hydrogen target. Merged metals and energy into "One Fortescue." Projects must now compete for capital (no more 10% NPAT earmark).
- October 2025: cut ~700 more jobs. Pivoted to R&D focus. Relocated some manufacturing to [[China]] and [[Germany]].
- FY2025 impact: ~$150M pre-tax writedown on cancelled projects.
- FY2026 guidance: ~$300M energy capex, ~$400M energy net opex.

[[Green hydrogen]] remains US$4.50-6.00/kg vs. US$1.00-2.00/kg for gray. The gap is narrowing but commercial viability at scale is years away.

## [[Copper]] expansion

December 2025: acquired remaining 64% of [[Alta Copper]] (TSX: ATCU) for C$139M (50% premium). Target: Canariaco Norte deposit in Peru — one of the largest undeveloped [[Copper|copper]] deposits in the Americas. Court approval received January 2026. [[Copper]] production not expected until 2031-2033.

This is the first material move to diversify beyond [[Iron ore|iron ore]].

## Ownership

| Holder | Stake |
|--------|-------|
| [[Andrew Forrest]] / Tattarang / [[Minderoo Foundation]] | 36.7% |
| Valin Holdings (Chinese steel) | ~8.8% |
| Capital Research and Management | ~5.0% |
| Institutional (total) | ~57% |

In June 2023, Forrest donated A$5B in FMG shares to [[Minderoo Foundation]] — one of Australia's largest philanthropic gifts. His 36.7% stake gives de facto control.

## Competitive position

| Factor | [[BHP]] | [[Rio Tinto]] | [[Vale]] | Fortescue |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Iron ore output | ~290 Mt | ~330 Mt | ~336 Mt | ~198 Mt |
| C1 cash cost | Low | Low | Low-Med | Very low (~$18/wmt) |
| Ore grade | ~62% Fe | ~62%+ Fe | 65%+ Fe | 57-62% Fe |
| Price vs benchmark | At/near | At/near | Premium | 5-10% discount |
| Revenue diversification | High ([[Copper|copper]] 28%) | Good (aluminum, [[Copper|copper]]) | Moderate | Minimal (~95% [[Iron ore|iron ore]]) |
| [[Morningstar]] moat | Wide | Wide | Narrow | None |

Fortescue's structural weakness: lowest C1 costs in the industry, but lower ore grades drive a realized price discount that offsets much of the cost advantage. Unlike peers, virtually no diversification today.

Simandou threat: the 120 Mtpa high-grade project in Guinea (first shipments expected late 2025) could further pressure pricing for lower-grade producers.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Industry-leading C1 costs (~$18/wmt) provide margin protection
- Record shipments (198 Mt) with guidance for further growth
- A$42B cumulative dividends — proven capital return track record
- ~5% dividend yield at current prices
- Iron Bridge magnetite (67% Fe) upgrades product mix over time
- [[Alta Copper]] acquisition begins diversification path
- Queens Valley extends Solomon hub life to 2064
- Founder-led with significant skin in the game (36.7%)

Bear:
- ~95% [[Iron ore|iron ore]], ~95% [[China]] — extreme concentration risk
- FY2025 showed 18% price drop → 41% profit decline (high operating leverage)
- Lower ore grades (57-62% Fe) face wider discounts in weak markets
- Green energy division has consumed capital with minimal return (~$150M writedown, 1,400+ jobs cut)
- Iron Bridge at 7.1 Mt vs. 22 Mtpa design — execution risk persists
- Simandou (120 Mtpa high-grade) increases global supply
- [[Copper]] production via [[Alta Copper]] is 5-7 years away
- No [[Morningstar]] moat rating — less defensible than [[BHP]]/[[Rio Tinto]]
- Leadership turnover and strategic pivots create uncertainty

## Leadership

| Role | Name |
|------|------|
| Executive Chairman | [[Andrew Forrest]] AO |
| CEO Metals | Dino Otranto |
| CEO Growth & Energy | Agustin (Gus) Pichot (from July 2025) |

Significant executive turnover — multiple CEO changes since 2023. Forrest's dual role as executive chairman and 36.7% owner means he drives strategic direction.
