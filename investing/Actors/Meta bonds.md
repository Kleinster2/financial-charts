## Blue Owl Hyperion SPV (off-balance-sheet)

Announced Oct 21, 2025. **Not** corporate debt of Meta — structured as off-balance-sheet JV.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| SPV name | Beignet Investor LLC |
| Total project cost | ~$27B |
| SPV debt | $27.3B senior secured, 144A private placement |
| Rating | A+ (S&P) — backed by Meta residual value guarantee |
| Pricing | ~225 bps over Treasuries |
| Maturity | 2049, fully amortizing |
| Anchor lenders | [[Pimco]] ($18B), [[BlackRock]] ($3B), [[Apollo]] |
| Arranger | [[Morgan Stanley]] |
| JV ownership | [[Blue Owl]] 80% / Meta 20% |
| Lease | Renewable 4-year operating leases at 11 buildings |
| Location | Hyperion campus, Richland Parish, Louisiana; 4M sq ft, 2-5 GW |

Meta treats this as an operating lease obligation. The A+ rating exceeds some of Meta's own corporate tranches because collateral is physical DC campus plus residual value guarantee.

## Embedded options (all issuances)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Make-whole call | Redeemable at greater of par or NPV of remaining coupons (Treasury + spread) |
| Make-whole spread | +15 bps (5-year), +20 bps (10-year), +25 bps (30/40-year) |

## Spread compression over time

| Issuance | 40-year spread | Credit rating at time |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Aug 2022 | ~T+165 | A1/A+ (inaugural) |
| May 2023 | ~T+192 | A1/A+ (post-SVB) |
| Aug 2024 | ~T+130 | Aa3/AA- (upgraded) |
| Oct 2025 | T+110 | Aa3/AA- |

Spread compression reflects Moody's upgrade to Aa3 (Apr 2024) and strong AI-linked demand. The May 2023 deal was wider despite same rating — banking turmoil risk premium.
