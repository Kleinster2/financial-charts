## Feb 2026 context

Bonds crashed ~70% in Sep 2025 after sudden crisis blindsided creditors. Fitch cut to CC. Stabilized in the 60-cent range after making coupon payments (Jan 12 and Jan 23, 2026 — hybrid bonds). Hired [[Lazard]], [[Cleary Gottlieb]], and Munhoz to review capital structure — action plan expected within 4-6 weeks. Chinese petrochemical overcapacity is the structural driver; [[Selic]] squeeze is the accelerant. [[Ambipar]]/Braskem collapses triggered early maturity clauses in COEs at [[XP Inc]] and [[BTG Pactual]], causing retail investors to lose up to 93% of capital.
