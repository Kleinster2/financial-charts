- Slowing growth + losses make IPO uncertain
- PE bid at <$3B rejected — suggests floor but not confident

- $300M+ ARR, large customer base
- $400M cash runway
- Tuck-in M&A expanding platform

**Bear:**
- Growth collapsed (50% → 12%)
- Still losing money
- Valuation down 65%+ from peak
- Three layoff rounds signal distress
- Competitive pressure from Wiz, GitHub, legacy vendors
