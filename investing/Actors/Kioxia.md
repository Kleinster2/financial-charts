**Kioxia** — Japanese NAND flash maker. \#2 globally. WD joint venture. IPO stalled. [[Bain Capital]] owned.

---

## Why Kioxia matters

Second-largest NAND producer, but structurally disadvantaged:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| NAND rank | \#2 globally |
| Ownership | [[Bain Capital]] (~56%), Toshiba, others |
| Status | Private (IPO attempts failed) |
| JV partner | [[Western Digital]] |
| HQ | Tokyo, [[Japan]] |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| NAND | \#2 (behind Samsung) | ~20% market share |
| DRAM | None | Not a player |
| [[HBM]] | None | Not a player |

**The gap**: No DRAM or [[HBM]] means missing the AI memory boom that's driving [[SK Hynix]] and [[Samsung]].

---

## SanDisk JV

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Structure | Joint NAND fabs in [[Japan]] (Yokkaichi, Kitakami) |
| Economics | Shared capex, separate products |
| History | Dates back to 2000; continued post-WDC spinoff |
| Extension | Jan 2026: Extended from 2029 → **2034** |
| Payment | [[SanDisk]] paying Kioxia **$1.165B** (2026-2029) |

**The arrangement**: [[SanDisk]] and Kioxia share fab costs but compete on products. Capital-efficient scale to compete with Korean giants.

---

## Origins

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2017 | Toshiba sells memory unit to Bain consortium |
| 2018 | Renamed "Kioxia" (combination of Japanese 記憶 "kioku" = memory + Greek "axia" = value) |
| 2019 | IPO planned |
| 2020 | IPO postponed (COVID, market conditions) |
| 2021 | WD merger talks collapse |
| 2023 | IPO attempt again, withdrawn |
| 2024 | Still private |

**The pattern**: Can't IPO, can't merge. Stuck.

---

## Failed WD merger

**2021 merger talks:**
- WD proposed acquiring Kioxia
- Would have created NAND giant
- Collapsed over valuation, antitrust concerns
- Kioxia wanted higher price
- JV continues awkwardly

---

## IPO struggles

| Attempt | Outcome | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2020 | Postponed | COVID, chip cycle downturn |
| 2023 | Withdrawn | Weak NAND pricing, investor appetite |
| 2024+ | Pending | Waiting for cycle improvement |
| **Dec 2024** | **Successful IPO** | Memory shortage tailwind |

**Bain's exit achieved**: December 2024 IPO — stock surged multiple times over following listing, propelled by tight memory supplies.

---

## Stock surge (Dec 2024 - Jan 2025)

**IPO success driven by shortage:**
- Listed December 2024
- Stock increased multiple times over post-IPO
- Tight NAND supplies driving investor interest
- Bain finally getting liquidity

**Why now worked:**
- Memory shortage creating pricing power
- NAND supply lagging demand
- AI infrastructure buildout absorbing capacity
- "Everything related to memory — advanced or conventional — is in very strong demand" — [[CLSA]]

---

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| [[Samsung]] | Behind on scale, technology, no DRAM |
| [[SK Hynix]] | Far behind (no [[HBM]] exposure) |
| [[Micron]] | Similar NAND, but Micron has DRAM |
| [[Western Digital]] | Partner/competitor hybrid |

**Structural disadvantage**: Pure NAND play in an era where [[HBM]] is the prize.

---

## Technology

| Generation | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 162-layer | Production |
| 218-layer | Ramping |
| BiCS (3D NAND) | Kioxia's architecture |

Competitive on NAND technology, but technology alone doesn't fix the business model.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- NAND cycle recovery
- \#2 position has value
- WD JV provides scale
- IPO could unlock value
- [[Japan]] government support

**Bear:**
- No [[HBM]] = missing AI boom
- IPO keeps failing
- Private equity overhang
- Commodity NAND margins
- Samsung/SK Hynix pulling ahead

---

## For theses

**[[Long memory]]**: Partial beneficiary of NAND shortage, but missing [[HBM]] upside. Less attractive than Korean memory plays.

**Not a priority**: Pure NAND exposure without DRAM/[[HBM]] makes Kioxia a second-tier memory play.
