| AI model | Ernie (文心一言) — early mover |
| Autonomous | Apollo — China leader |
| Cloud | #4 China |

## Ernie AI model

**China's ChatGPT rival:**
- Ernie Bot (文心一言) launched March 2023
- First major China LLM
- Integrated into Baidu Search
- Enterprise API available

**Early mover status:**
- Beat Alibaba, Tencent to market
- Significant user base
- But competitors catching up
- [[ByteDance]] Doubao gaining

---

## Apollo autonomous driving

**China's leading AV platform:**
- Robotaxi operations in multiple cities
- 100M+ km autonomous miles
- L4 autonomous technology
- Partnerships with OEMs

**Apollo Go:**
- Commercial robotaxi service
- Wuhan, Beijing, other cities
- Revenue generating (small)
- Path to scale unclear

---

## Baidu Cloud

**#4 in China cloud:**
- Behind Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei
- AI cloud focus
- Enterprise customers
- Smaller than peers

---

## AI chip efforts

**Kunlun (昆仑) chips:**
- Custom AI accelerators
- Reducing NVIDIA dependency
- Multiple generations shipped
- Still behind NVIDIA performance

**Export control response:**
- Custom silicon investment
- Domestic partnerships
- But gap remains

|-----------|---------|
| Search competition | ByteDance, Xiaohongshu eroding |
| Cloud position | #4, hard to catch up |
