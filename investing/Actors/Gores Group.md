## Why Gores Group matters

**SPAC pioneer.** Gores revived the modern SPAC market with the Hostess Brands deal in 2015. Has since launched more SPACs than any other sponsor — 13+ vehicles with 8+ completed mergers totaling $38B+ in transaction value.

**Cautionary tale.** Despite the volume, results have been mixed to poor:
- **Polestar** — $20B valuation at merger, now trading under $1 (down 90%+), facing Nasdaq delisting
- **[[Sonder]]** — $2.2B valuation at merger, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy November 2025
- **UWM** — $16B valuation (largest SPAC ever at time), now ~$5 (down 50%+ from $10)

The pattern: massive valuations at merger, steep declines post-close.

## Notable disasters

### Polestar (PSNY)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SPAC merger | 2022 |
| Merger valuation | $20B |
| Current price | <$1 (Jan 2026) |
| YTD 2025 | -60% |
| Status | Nasdaq compliance warning (min $1 bid) |
| Net loss (9M 2025) | -$1.6B |

Polestar reported its "best year" for sales but stock still collapsed. High debt, persistent losses, EV competition.

### Sonder (SOND)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SPAC merger | Jan 2022 |
| Merger valuation | $2.2B |
| Bankruptcy | Chapter 7, Nov 2025 |
| Trigger | Marriott terminated licensing deal |
| Accumulated deficit | $1.4B |

Marriott partnership was supposed to save Sonder — instead, integration problems accelerated collapse. Shareholders expected to receive nothing.

### United Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SPAC merger | Jan 2021 |
| Merger valuation | $16B (largest SPAC at time) |
| Current price | ~$5 |
| Lawsuit | Investors sued Gores for "lopsided structure" |

Stock fell from $10 to $7 within 3 months of merger. Lawsuit alleged deal favored sponsors regardless of performance.
