**ASE Technology (ASX)** — world's largest OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test), beneficiary of AI packaging/test bottlenecks.

## Core thesis

ASE sits at the intersection of two bottlenecks: [[Advanced packaging]] and [[Final test bottleneck]]. As AI chips get bigger and more complex, ASE's capacity becomes more valuable. Not a foundry play — a "picks and shovels" play.

## What they do

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Assembly | Wire bonding, flip chip, advanced packaging |
| Test | Final electrical/functional test before ship |
| Materials | Substrates, leadframes |

They don't design or manufacture chips — they package and test what foundries produce.

---

## Why they benefit from AI

- Larger packages (~120mm) → more complex assembly
- Higher heat → advanced test handlers required
- [[HBM]] integration → more packaging steps
- Capacity constrained → pricing power

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ASX (NYSE) |
| Market cap | ~$22B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$20B |
| Market position | \#1 OSAT globally |
| 2025 capex increase | +$1B for AI/HPC capacity |
| AI/HPC revenue | Projected to more than double |
| Gross margin | ~18% |
| P/E | ~15x |

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Amkor | \#2 OSAT, similar positioning |
| JCET | Chinese OSAT, lower end |
| [[TSMC]] | Competes in advanced packaging (CoWoS), not test |

---

## Relationship to foundries

| Foundry | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Customer — ASE tests/packages TSMC wafers |
| [[Samsung]] | Customer |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Customer |

ASE is foundry-agnostic. Whoever wins foundry, ASE still gets the packaging/test business.

---

## Market expectations

**Priced in:**
- AI demand growth
- Capacity expansion

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Bottleneck tighter than expected → pricing power
- Advanced packaging share gains vs TSMC
- Test constraints become headlines

## US-[[Taiwan]] trade deal (Jan 2026)

**Beneficiary of [[US-Taiwan relations]] breakthrough:**

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tariffs | Cut to 15% on [[Taiwan]] goods |
| Investment framework | $500B [[Taiwan]] chip commitment |
| Sentiment | Reduced [[Taiwan]] risk premium |

ASE benefits as [[Taiwan]] OSAT leader — lower tariffs on packaged/tested chips shipped to US customers.

---

## For theses

- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — core holding, \#1 OSAT
- [[Long memory]] — more memory = more packaging/test
- Foundry-agnostic: benefits regardless of TSMC vs Samsung outcome
