South Korea's second-largest semiconductor foundry behind [[Samsung Electronics]], specializing in 200mm (8-inch) legacy chips. As TSMC and Samsung pivot to advanced nodes for AI, DB HiTek is filling the gap in mature-node fabrication for power management ICs (PMICs), display driver ICs (DDIs), and image sensors.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Ticker** | 000990.KS |
| **HQ** | Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea |
| **CEO** | Cho Ki-Seog |
| **Revenue (TTM)** | ~₩1.3T (~$917M) |
| **Market Cap** | ~$1.7B |
| **Wafer Capacity** | 154,000 8-inch wafers/month → 190,000 (+23%) |
| **Founded** | 1997 (as Dongbu Electronics) |
| **Parent** | [[DB Group]] |

## History

- **1997**: Founded as Dongbu Electronics, initially a memory chipmaker
- **2001**: Pivoted to foundry business model
- **2002**: Acquired Anam Semiconductor's foundry operation from [[Amkor Technology]] for ₩114B ($93M)
- **2007**: Merged with Dongbu Hannong Chemical to form Dongbu HiTek
- **2017**: Renamed to DB HiTek when parent Dongbu Group became DB Group
- **2023**: Spun off fabless design division as DB GlobalChip to focus on foundry manufacturing

## What they make

DB HiTek runs two 8-inch fabs producing analog and mixed-signal chips:

| Product | Applications |
|---------|-------------|
| **PMICs** (Power Management ICs) | Mobile, industrial, automotive, medical |
| **DDIs** (Display Driver ICs) | TVs, smartphones, displays |
| **CIS** (Contact Image Sensors) | Scanners, copiers |
| **BCDMOS** | High-voltage analog |

Process technologies: BCDMOS, analog CMOS, high-voltage CMOS, mixed signal, CIS, flash, logic. Specialty is 0.18μm BCDMOS — they were first to develop this.

## Strategic position

**The legacy chip play.** While [[TSMC]] and Samsung chase 3nm and below for AI chips, someone still needs to make the "boring" chips that go in everything — voltage regulators, display drivers, sensor interfaces. These don't need cutting-edge nodes; they need mature, reliable 8-inch fabs.

DB HiTek benefits from:

1. **Structural supply shortage**: Samsung and TSMC scaling back 200mm capacity as they shift to 300mm for advanced nodes
2. **Steady demand**: PMICs and DDIs are in every electronic device — phones, TVs, cars, industrial equipment
3. **Pricing power**: Legacy capacity is tight; DB HiTek has been raising prices
4. **Lower capex**: 8-inch equipment is mature and relatively cheap vs. EUV-driven leading edge

## Technology roadmap

DB HiTek is expanding into next-gen power semiconductors:

| Timeline | Development |
|----------|-------------|
| **Oct 2025** | 650V GaN HEMT process MPW program launched |
| **2025** | 1200V SiC MOSFET for automotive |
| **Q4 2026** | Full-scale GaN/SiC foundry production |
| **End 2026** | 200V GaN process + 650V GaN optimized for IC integration |

Expanding Fab2 cleanroom in Chungcheongbuk-do by 35,000 wafers/month for GaN, BCDMOS, and SiC processes.

## Financials

| Year       | Revenue | Net Income | Notes                           |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2022       | ₩1.67T  | ₩557B      | Chip shortage supercycle peak   |
| 2023       | ₩1.15T  | ₩264B      | Normalization                   |
| 2024       | ₩1.13T  | ₩229B      | Trough (-2% YoY rev)            |
| 2025 Q1-Q3 | ₩1.01T  | ₩196B      | Recovery; Q3 op profit +71% YoY |

Trading at 0.5x P/B — cheap if legacy foundry demand holds.

## Price chart

![[db-hitek-price-chart.png]]
*DB HiTek (blue) +260% vs [[Samsung Electronics]] +85% since 2020. Outperformance driven by legacy chip supply tightness and GaN/SiC expansion narrative. Late 2025 surge as power semiconductor demand accelerated.*

## Fundamentals

![[db-hitek-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked at ~₩450B/quarter in 2022 during chip shortage supercycle, fell to ~₩280B trough in 2024, now recovering to ₩375B. Net income followed same pattern — ₩170B peak in 2022, collapsed to ~₩50B, now rebounding to ₩90B.*

## Competitive landscape

| Company             | Position                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [[Samsung]]         | \#1 Korea foundry, pivoting to advanced nodes |
| [[TSMC]]            | Global leader, reducing 8-inch exposure      |
| [[UMC]]             | Taiwan-based, similar mature-node focus      |
| [[GlobalFoundries]] | US-based, abandoned leading edge             |
| [[SMIC]]            | China, geopolitically constrained            |

DB HiTek's niche: pure-play 8-inch specialist in a market where giants are exiting.

## Risks

- **Demand cyclicality**: Consumer electronics weakness hits PMIC/DDI volumes
- **Won appreciation**: Revenue in USD, costs in KRW
- **Samsung re-entry**: If margins improve, Samsung could recommit to legacy
- **GaN/SiC execution**: New technology ramp is unproven
