## Why Chile matters

Chile is the Saudi Arabia of copper:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global copper share | ~25% |
| Largest producer | [[Codelco]] (state-owned) |
| Key companies | Codelco, [[Antofagasta]], Escondida (BHP) |
| Relevance | Copper for AI infrastructure |

## Copper for AI

**Chile's copper feeds AI buildout:**
- Data center wiring and busbars

## Political/regulatory risk

**Increasing royalties and taxes:**

| Constitutional reform | Uncertainty (2022 rejected) |
| Water restrictions | Operational limits |
| Community opposition | Project delays |
| Nationalization risk | Low but non-zero |

## Codelco's struggles

**State producer declining:**
- Production falling (aging mines)
- Underinvestment for decades
- Profits extracted by government
- Transition costs (open-pit to underground)

**Implication:** Codelco struggles = tighter global supply = higher prices = good for others.
