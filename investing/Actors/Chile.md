## Why Chile matters

Chile is the Saudi Arabia of copper:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global copper share | ~25% |
| Largest producer | [[Codelco]] (state-owned) |
| Key companies | Codelco, [[Antofagasta]], Escondida ([[BHP]]) |
| Relevance | [[Copper]] for AI infrastructure |

## [[Copper]] for AI

**Chile's copper feeds AI buildout:**
- Data center wiring and busbars
- Liquid cooling systems
- Grid infrastructure upgrades
- EV charging networks

See [[Copper for AI]] for thesis.

## Major copper operations

| Operation | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| [[Codelco]] | State | World's largest producer |
| Escondida | [[BHP]] (57.5%) | World's largest mine |
| Collahuasi | Anglo American/Glencore | Top 5 globally |
| [[Antofagasta]] | Luksic family | Pure-play public |
| Los Pelambres | Antofagasta | Expansion underway |

## Telecom infrastructure — US-China squeeze (Feb 2026)

**Chile caught between its largest trade partner and its security ally over submarine cables.**

Two competing trans-Pacific cable projects:

| Cable | Route | Backers | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| [[Humboldt Cable]] | Valparaiso → French Polynesia → Australia | [[Google]], NEC ([[Japan]]) | Installing (2026 operational) |
| [[Chile-China Express]] | Valparaiso → Hong Kong | [[China Mobile]], Inchcape | Under consideration |

On Feb 20, 2026, the US revoked visas for Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz and two [[Subtel]] officials for "undermining regional security" by advancing the China cable. First time the US has sanctioned a sitting allied cabinet minister over telecom infrastructure. See [[US Chile cable visa sanctions]].

**Strategic context:** [[China]]'s 2017 Cybersecurity Law requires companies to cooperate with state intelligence — data transiting Chinese-managed cables could be accessed by Beijing. The US views the [[Humboldt Cable]] as the acceptable alternative.

**Chile's dilemma:** [[China]] buys ~30% of Chilean exports (mostly [[Copper]]). Cutting telecom ties with China risks trade retaliation against Chile's primary export commodity.

## Political/regulatory risk

**Increasing royalties and taxes:**

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Royalty increases | Margin compression |
| Constitutional reform | Uncertainty (2022 rejected) |
| Water restrictions | Operational limits |
| Community opposition | Project delays |
| Nationalization risk | Low but non-zero |
| US-China telecom squeeze | Diplomatic pressure (visa sanctions, Feb 2026) |

## Codelco's struggles

**State producer declining:**
- Production falling (aging mines)
- Underinvestment for decades
- Profits extracted by government
- Transition costs (open-pit to underground)

**Implication:** Codelco struggles = tighter global supply = higher prices = good for others.

## Investment angle

**Chile's stock market closely tracks copper prices** — commodity supercycle = Chile equity rally.

**Chile exposure via:**
| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Antofagasta]] | ANTO.L | Pure-play Chile |
| [[BHP]] | [[BHP]] | Escondida owner |
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | FCX | Some Chile exposure |
| [[Southern Copper]] | SCCO | Peru/[[Mexico]], not Chile |

See [[Long emerging markets]] — Chile as commodity play in EM supercycle thesis.

## [[Lithium]] bonus

**Chile also major lithium producer:**
- Salar de Atacama (world's best lithium brine)
- [[SQM]], [[Albemarle]] operations
- EV battery relevance
- Government seeking more control

---

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Copper]] production | ~5.5M tons/year |
| Global share | ~25% |
| GDP | ~$300B |
| Key export | [[Copper]] (~50% of exports) |
| State producer | [[Codelco]] |
