## Investment philosophy

### Factor investing

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Value | Buy cheap, sell expensive |
| Momentum | Buy winners, sell losers |
| Quality | Buy profitable, stable companies |
| Low risk | Buy low-volatility stocks |
| Carry | Capture yield differentials |

### Core beliefs

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Evidence-based | Academic research drives strategy |
| Systematic | Rules-based, no discretion |
| Transparent | Publishes methodology (unusual for hedge funds) |
| Diversified | Across factors, geographies, asset classes |
| Lower fees | Cheaper than typical hedge funds |

**Contrast to Renaissance**: RenTech is secretive; AQR is transparent. Both are quant.

## Three quant crises

Asness has navigated three major drawdowns:

| Crisis | Period | Cause | Outcome |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Quant meltdown | Aug 2007 | Factor crowding; rapid deleveraging | Recovered |
| Value crash | 2018-2020 | Growth/momentum dominated; value collapsed | Defended publicly |
| Post-COVID | 2020-2022 | Meme stocks, low rates hurt factors | Stuck to process |

Each time AQR stuck to its process and eventually recovered.

| Twitter/X | Active; argues with critics |
