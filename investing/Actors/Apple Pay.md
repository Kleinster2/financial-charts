**Apple Pay** — [[Apple]]'s digital wallet and checkout service. Dominant on iOS, surpassing [[PayPal]] in US online volumes by 2025.

## Why Apple Pay matters

Apple Pay is winning the [[Checkout wars]] through platform lock-in:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global users | **659M** (2025) |
| US users | **84M** (2025) |
| US market share | ~50% of mobile wallet users |
| US online volume | ~$205B (6% of $3.2T e-commerce) |
| Annual transaction value | **$10T** globally (all channels) |
| Merchant acceptance | **85%** of US merchants |

---

## Competitive advantage

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| **Native iOS** | 60% of US consumers use iPhones |
| **Face ID/Touch ID** | One-tap biometric checkout |
| **No app switch** | Stays in merchant app/site |
| **Safari integration** | Default checkout on Apple devices |
| **Privacy** | No tracking, tokenized transactions |

This is [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] applied to payments — deep OS integration that competitors can't replicate.

## Competitive dynamics

### vs PayPal
- Apple Pay: One-tap, native, no login
- PayPal: App switch or password, friction

### vs Shop Pay
- Apple Pay: Works everywhere, iOS-native
- Shop Pay: Shopify ecosystem only, but deeper merchant integration

### vs Google Pay
- Apple Pay: iOS exclusive, 2x US user base
- Google Pay: Android, broader platform reach

## Antitrust pressure

Apple's NFC wallet monopoly under legal pressure:
- **2024:** Antitrust ruling forced Apple to open NFC to competitors
- **Impact:** Could erode Apple Pay's tap-to-pay advantage
- **Timeline:** Competitors gaining NFC access 2025+

Apple's 85% merchant acceptance came from NFC exclusivity — opening it may slow growth.

---

## Business model

Apple earns ~0.15% of card transactions — revenue sharing with issuing banks. Small per-transaction but massive scale.

| Revenue source | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| Card network fees | ~0.15% of transactions |
| Apple Card interest | Goldman partnership |
| Services bundling | Apple One, Apple Card |

Apple Pay is primarily strategic — strengthens iPhone ecosystem lock-in.

## Apple Pay Later (discontinued)

- Launched 2023 as BNPL product
- **Discontinued 2024**
- Strategy shift: Partner with banks for installment loans instead of competing directly
- Reduces credit risk, still captures checkout

---

## Investment implications

Apple Pay growth is a component of [[Apple]]'s Services revenue (~$100B annually). Not disclosed separately but contributes to:
- iPhone stickiness
- Services margin expansion
- Competitive moat vs Android

**For PayPal investors:** Apple Pay is structural threat, not cyclical. iOS checkout share will continue shifting.
