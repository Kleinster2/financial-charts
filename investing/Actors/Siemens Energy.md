**Siemens Energy** — #2 gas turbine manufacturer. German industrial, wind + gas portfolio.

---

## Why Siemens Energy matters

Siemens Energy is the main GE Vernova competitor — same bottleneck dynamics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #2 gas turbine manufacturer |
| Market share | ~25% (GE, Siemens, Mitsubishi = 70%+) |
| HQ | Munich, Germany |
| Portfolio | Gas turbines + wind |

---

## Gas turbine bottleneck

**Same constraints as [[GE Vernova]]:**
- 3-5 year waitlists
- Can't expand capacity fast enough
- Demand from AI/data centers overwhelming
- $400B+ projects at risk industry-wide

**Key product:** SGT-A35 aeroderivative — comparable to GE's LM series.

---

## Data center strategy

**Eaton partnership (Jun 2025):**
- Simultaneous DC + power plant construction
- On-site generation with grid connection
- SGT-800 gas turbines
- Integrated solution for hyperscalers

**Value prop:** Build data center and power plant together — faster than waiting for grid.

## Product portfolio

| Turbine | Type | Use case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **SGT-A35** | Aeroderivative | Fast-deploy, peaker |
| **SGT-800** | Industrial | Medium-scale, DC power |
| **SGT5-9000HL** | Heavy-duty | Utility scale |

---

## Wind business challenges

**Siemens Gamesa (wind subsidiary):**
- Quality issues in 2023-2024
- Significant losses
- Restructuring underway
- Dragged on overall company

**Gas turbines:** Offsetting wind weakness with strong demand.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | Siemens advantage |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| [[GE Vernova]] | Scale, US presence | European market |
| Mitsubishi | Asia presence | Full portfolio |

Siemens is #2 but benefits from same supply constraints.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Oligopoly dynamics (supply constrained)
- AI power demand secular
- Gas turbine backlog growing
- European energy transition exposure
- Cheaper than GE Vernova

**Bear:**
- Wind business issues
- Execution concerns
- Less US exposure than GE
- German industrial challenges
