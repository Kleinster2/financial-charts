*[[Siemens Energy]] vs [[GE Vernova]] — ENR.DE has outperformed since mid-2023 Gamesa trough, both riding AI power demand*

## Why [[Siemens]] Energy matters

[[Siemens]] Energy is the main GE Vernova competitor — same bottleneck dynamics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#2 gas turbine manufacturer |
| Market share | ~25% (GE, [[Siemens]], [[Mitsubishi]] = 70%+) |
| HQ | Munich, [[Germany]] |
| Portfolio | Gas turbines, wind, grid tech |

---

## Gas turbine bottleneck

**Same constraints as [[GE Vernova]]:**
- 3-5 year waitlists
- Can't expand capacity fast enough
- Demand from AI/data centers overwhelming
- $400B+ projects at risk industry-wide

**Key product:** SGT-A35 aeroderivative — comparable to GE's LM series.

---

## Data center strategy

**[[Eaton]] partnership (Jun 2025):**
- Simultaneous DC + power plant construction
- On-site generation with grid connection
- SGT-800 gas turbines
- Integrated solution for hyperscalers

**Value prop:** Build data center and power plant together — faster than waiting for grid.

## Meta Socrates South deal (Jan 2026)

**Per [[SemiAnalysis]]:**

| Turbine model | Quantity | Capacity each | Total |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| SGT-400 IGT | 3 | 14.3 MW | 42.9 MW |

Part of Meta's hybrid fleet (4 turbine types, ~307 MW gross). [[Siemens]] providing ~14% of capacity alongside [[Solar Turbines]] ([[Caterpillar]]).

**Significance:** First major hyperscaler BYOP deal for [[Siemens]] Energy. Validates DC power strategy.

---

## Product portfolio

| Turbine | Type | Use case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **SGT-A35** | Aeroderivative | Fast-deploy, peaker |
| **SGT-800** | Industrial | Medium-scale, DC power |
| **SGT5-9000HL** | Heavy-duty | Utility scale |

## Q1 FY2026 earnings (Feb 11, 2026)

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Order backlog | €146B | Record |
| Gas turbines booked | 102 | Strongest quarter ever |
| Gas Services margin | 16.6% | Before special items |
| Grid Technologies margin | 17.6% | Orders +21.8% YoY |
| Gamesa operating loss | -€46M | Improved from -€374M YoY |
| Gamesa net loss | -€221M | Includes €175M special charge |

**FY2026 guidance confirmed:**

| Metric | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Revenue growth | 11-13% (on FY2025 base of €39.1B) |
| Profit margin (before SI) | 9-11% |
| Net income | €3-4B |
| Free cash flow (pre-tax) | €4-5B |

**Gas Services detail:** 12 GW converted from reservations to orders, 12 GW new reservations. Regional mix: 40% US, 35% [[Europe]], 15% Middle East/[[China]]. CEO Bruch: reservations converting 1:1 into orders.

**Grid Technologies:** US data-center orders in high triple-digit-million-euro range.

---

## Expansion (Feb 2026)

- **US manufacturing:** $1B+ investment, 1,500 new jobs nationwide, including Fort Payne, Alabama expansion (120 jobs)
- **Middle East:** Targeting Iraq (~14 GW with partners, on top of 11.65 GW installed) and [[Syria]] grid rebuilding. 117 GW total ME capacity.

---

## Wind business

**[[Siemens]] Gamesa (wind subsidiary):**
- Quality issues in 2023-2024 drove massive losses
- Restructuring underway — narrowed operating loss to -€46M in Q1 FY2026 (from -€374M YoY)
- Plans to break even in FY2026
- Orders down 33.7% YoY to €1.5B — selective approach

**Gas turbines:** Offsetting wind weakness with record demand.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | [[Siemens]] advantage |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| [[GE Vernova]] | Scale, US presence | European market |
| [[Mitsubishi]] | [[Asia]] presence | Full portfolio |

[[Siemens]] is \#2 but benefits from same supply constraints.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Oligopoly dynamics (supply constrained)
- AI power demand secular
- Gas turbine backlog growing
- European energy transition exposure
- Cheaper than GE Vernova

**Bear:**
- Wind business issues
- Execution concerns
- Less US exposure than GE
- German industrial challenges
