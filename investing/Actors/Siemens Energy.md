**[[Siemens]] Energy** — \#2 gas turbine manufacturer. German industrial, wind + gas portfolio.

---

## Why [[Siemens]] Energy matters

[[Siemens]] Energy is the main GE Vernova competitor — same bottleneck dynamics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#2 gas turbine manufacturer |
| Market share | ~25% (GE, [[Siemens]], Mitsubishi = 70%+) |
| HQ | Munich, [[Germany]] |
| Portfolio | Gas turbines + wind |

---

## Gas turbine bottleneck

**Same constraints as [[GE Vernova]]:**
- 3-5 year waitlists
- Can't expand capacity fast enough
- Demand from AI/data centers overwhelming
- $400B+ projects at risk industry-wide

**Key product:** SGT-A35 aeroderivative — comparable to GE's LM series.

---

## Data center strategy

**[[Eaton]] partnership (Jun 2025):**
- Simultaneous DC + power plant construction
- On-site generation with grid connection
- SGT-800 gas turbines
- Integrated solution for hyperscalers

**Value prop:** Build data center and power plant together — faster than waiting for grid.

## Meta Socrates South deal (Jan 2026)

**Per SemiAnalysis:**

| Turbine model | Quantity | Capacity each | Total |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| SGT-400 IGT | 3 | 14.3 MW | 42.9 MW |

Part of Meta's hybrid fleet (4 turbine types, ~307 MW gross). [[Siemens]] providing ~14% of capacity alongside [[Solar Turbines]] ([[Caterpillar]]).

**Significance:** First major hyperscaler BYOP deal for [[Siemens]] Energy. Validates DC power strategy.

---

## Product portfolio

| Turbine | Type | Use case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **SGT-A35** | Aeroderivative | Fast-deploy, peaker |
| **SGT-800** | Industrial | Medium-scale, DC power |
| **SGT5-9000HL** | Heavy-duty | Utility scale |

---

## Wind business challenges

**[[Siemens]] Gamesa (wind subsidiary):**
- Quality issues in 2023-2024
- Significant losses
- Restructuring underway
- Dragged on overall company

**Gas turbines:** Offsetting wind weakness with strong demand.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | [[Siemens]] advantage |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| [[GE Vernova]] | Scale, US presence | European market |
| Mitsubishi | [[Asia]] presence | Full portfolio |

[[Siemens]] is \#2 but benefits from same supply constraints.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Oligopoly dynamics (supply constrained)
- AI power demand secular
- Gas turbine backlog growing
- European energy transition exposure
- Cheaper than GE Vernova

**Bear:**
- Wind business issues
- Execution concerns
- Less US exposure than GE
- German industrial challenges
