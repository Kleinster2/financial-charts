## Acquisition strategy

**Transformed through M&A:**

| Acquisition | Year | Value | Added |
|-------------|------|-------|-------|
| Intersil | 2017 | $3.2B | Analog, power |
| IDT | 2019 | $6.7B | Connectivity, timing |
| Dialog Semi | 2021 | $5.9B | Power management |
| Transphorm | 2024 | ~$300M | GaN power |

Acquisitions shifted Renesas from pure MCU to broader analog/power portfolio.

## Technology focus

| Technology | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Automotive]] MCUs | Market leader |
| R-Car (SoCs) | ADAS, infotainment |
| Power management | Dialog acquisition |
| GaN power | Transphorm acquisition |
| Analog | Intersil, IDT |

---

## Competitive position

| vs | Renesas advantage | Renesas disadvantage |
|----|-------------------|----------------------|
| [[Infineon]] | MCU leadership | Power semis scale |
| [[NXP]] | [[Japan]] relationships | Radar/V2X |
| [[STMicro]] | MCU breadth | SiC scale |
| [[Texas Instruments]] | [[Automotive]] focus | Analog breadth |

Renesas is MCU-centric; competitors stronger in power/analog.

## 2021 fab fire

**Naka fab fire (Mar 2021):**
- Major supply disruption
- Exacerbated global auto chip shortage
- Rebuilt and resumed production
- Highlighted concentration risk

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 6723.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~¥4T (~$27B) |
| Revenue (FY24) | ~¥1.5T (~$10B) |
| [[Automotive]] revenue | ~50% |
| Gross margin | ~55% |
| P/E | ~15x |

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- MCU leadership defensible
- Acquisitions added analog/power
- [[EV transition]] = more chips per car
- [[Japan]] auto relationships sticky

**Bear case:**
- [[Japan]] exposure concentrated
- Competition from Infineon, NXP
- Fab fire showed concentration risk
- Yen volatility
