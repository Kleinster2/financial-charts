## AI infrastructure financing

- ~50% from cash flow, ~50% from debt markets
- Banks increasingly concentrated in small group of borrowers

## SRT exploration (Jan 2026)

**Considering significant risk transfer to offload data center exposure:**

Morgan Stanley exploring [[Significant risk transfer]] tied to portfolio of AI infrastructure loans. Early-stage talks with investors.

**Why it matters:**
- Banks may be overexposed to concentrated group of AI infrastructure borrowers
- SRTs let banks hedge credit exposure, manage capital ratios, free balance sheet
- Data-center SRTs still nascent slice of credit-risk transfer market
- Also exploring other hedging/syndication options

**Oracle warning:** Morgan Stanley research flagged [[Oracle]] CDS spreads spiking — banks/lenders likely driving the surge as Oracle has borrowed tens of billions for AI expansion.

**Peers also active:** [[Citigroup]], [[JPMorgan]], [[Goldman Sachs]] all marketed SRT deals in 2025. Global SRT sales expected +11% annually through 2027.
