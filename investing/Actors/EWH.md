Top 10 account for ~70% of the fund. Financials (~49%) and real estate (~17%) dominate, with no meaningful tech allocation.

## What It Is (and Isn't)

EWH tracks Hong Kong-domiciled companies — it is not a broad China equity fund. Does not hold mainland tech giants like [[Alibaba]], [[Tencent]], or [[BYD]]. For direct mainland exposure, see [[FXI]] or [[MCHI]].

The fund benefits from Hong Kong's role as a financial hub and gateway to China, but the underlying businesses are insurance ([[AIA Group]]), exchange operations ([[HKEX]]), property, and utilities — not the Chinese tech narrative.

## Recent Performance

The Hang Seng gained 28% in 2025 (best year since 2017) and carried momentum into 2026, briefly trading above 28,000. Key catalysts: Beijing fiscal support signals, [[DeepSeek]] AI launch boosting sentiment, property sector regulatory easing, and Hong Kong reclaiming top global IPO hub status ($24B raised in 2025).

Valuations remain attractive — Hang Seng P/E ~11.5x vs [[S&P 500]] ~22x forward.
