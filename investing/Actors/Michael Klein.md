## Why Michael Klein matters

**Prolific SPAC sponsor despite mixed results.** Klein keeps raising capital — Churchill Capital X raised $414M (May 2025), Churchill Capital XI filed for $300M — even as prior deals have been disasters. Markets still trust the Citigroup pedigree.

**Infleqtion deal** could rehabilitate the franchise if quantum computing pans out. Q1 2026 expected close.

| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Churchill X**  | [[Infleqtion]]               | INFQ (pending) | +46% (pre-close) |
| Churchill IX     | PlusAI                       | PLSX (pending) | +7%              |
| Churchill VII    | —                            | Liquidated     | —                |
| Churchill VI     | —                            | Liquidated     | —                |
| Churchill V      | —                            | Liquidated     | —                |
| **Churchill IV** | [[Lucid]]                    | LCID           | **-87%**         |
| Churchill III    | [[Claritev]]                 | CTEV           | **-89%**         |

**Pattern:** High-profile targets, retail hype, then collapse. Lucid and MultiPlan were both hyped deals that cratered post-merger.

## Investment implications

**SPACs are risky** — Klein's track record shows why. Even well-connected sponsors with "quality" targets can produce -87% returns.

**Infleqtion could be different:**
- Real revenue ($29M TTM)
- Real customers ([[NVIDIA]], DoD, NASA)
- Quantum is hot sector
- But: SPAC structure still creates misaligned incentives

**Watch for:**
- INFQ post-merger trading (SPACs often volatile)
- Redemptions before close
- Churchill XI target announcement
