## Succession question

**The issue**: Arnault is 75. No public succession plan. Five children in key roles but unclear who leads.

**April 2025**: Extended LVMH age limit for chairman/CEO to 85.

**His position**: "The best person—inside or outside the family—should take over." Insists inheritance isn't automatic.

**Investor concern**: Shareholders increasingly view lack of clarity as corporate risk. Second-generation family transitions are historically difficult.

**Academic view**: "This is a time bomb. When you are five, tensions can't be avoided." — Eric Pichet, Kedge Business School

## Management style

- **Control**: Maintains tight grip on all major decisions
- **Brand autonomy**: Lets creative directors run brands with independence
- **M&A**: Aggressive acquirer, patient integrator
- **Cost discipline**: Known for operational efficiency
- **Long-term**: Thinks in decades, not quarters
