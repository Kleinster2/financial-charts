## Why Shenzhen matters

Shenzhen is where hardware gets built:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$500B |
| Focus | Hardware, manufacturing, supply chain |
| Champions | Huawei, BYD, DJI, Tencent, ZTE |
| Advantage | Speed, scale, supply chain density |

## Shenzhen vs Hangzhou

| Factor | Shenzhen | [[Hangzhou]] |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Hardware, manufacturing | Software, AI, platforms |
| **Champions** | BYD, DJI, Huawei | Alibaba, DeepSeek, Unitree |
| **Talent** | Supply chain, engineering | Algorithms, data, ZJU |
| **Advantage** | Build anything fast | AI/software innovation |

**Complementary:** Hardware companies often partner with Shenzhen, software with Hangzhou.

## Huaqiangbei electronics market

**World's largest electronics market:**
- Components for anything
- Knockoffs and genuine parts
- Rapid prototyping ecosystem
- Where hardware ideas become real

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable as geography**, but:
- [[BYD]] — public (1211.HK, BYDDY)
- [[Huawei]] — private, sanctions-impacted
- [[Tencent]] — public (0700.HK)

**Thesis:** Shenzhen = China's hardware execution capability. Even under sanctions, manufacturing moat persists.
