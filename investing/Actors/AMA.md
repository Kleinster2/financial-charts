## Why AMA matters

**Physician lobbying powerhouse.** One of the largest healthcare lobbying organizations in the US. Shapes Medicare reimbursement, scope-of-practice rules, medical education standards, and drug policy. Historically conservative on healthcare reform — opposed Medicare in the 1960s.

**Claritev lawsuit.** In October 2024, the AMA (with Illinois State Medical Society) sued [[Claritev]] for operating an illegal price-fixing cartel. The suit alleges ~700 insurers coordinate out-of-network reimbursement through Claritev's algorithms — suppressing provider payments by billions annually. DOJ filed a statement of interest supporting the plaintiffs in March 2025.

## Key policy positions (2025-2026)

| Issue | AMA position |
|-------|--------------|
| **Claritev antitrust** | Lead plaintiff; alleges "hub-and-spoke" price-fixing |
| **Telehealth** | Supports CONNECT for Health Act; permanent flexibilities |
| **Medicare** | Opposes payment cuts; pushed CMS on Plan Finder accuracy |
| **Medicaid** | Opposes cuts in reconciliation bills; warns of rural hospital closures |
| **Vaccines** | Advocates for access; opposes HHS restrictions |
| **Abortion** | Opposes state criminalization (though historically quiet) |

## Strategy shift (2025)

After years of behind-the-scenes lobbying, the AMA adopted a more public advocacy stance under the Trump II administration. The shift came as federal policies diverged from medical consensus on vaccines, reproductive health, and Medicaid.

Critics note the AMA was slow to speak out on abortion bans and anti-vaccination policies in 2024-2025.

## Revenue model

The AMA generates significant revenue from:
- **CPT codes** — Controls the billing code system used by all US healthcare providers. Licensing fees are substantial
- **Membership dues** — ~$52/year for JAMA included
- **Advertising and publications** — JAMA Network

This revenue structure creates potential conflicts — the AMA profits from billing complexity while ostensibly advocating for physicians.
