**Qualcomm** — Dominant mobile SoC and modem supplier. Snapdragon powers most Android phones. Pushing into automotive, PC, and AI inference.

---

## Why it matters

Qualcomm has:
- **Modem monopoly**: Only viable 5G modem supplier (Apple trying to escape)
- **Snapdragon**: Leading Android SoC, ARM-based
- **Licensing**: Collects royalties on nearly all smartphones

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| QCT (chips) | Snapdragon SoCs, modems, RF front-end |
| QTL (licensing) | Patent royalties on 3G/4G/5G |
| Automotive | Snapdragon Ride, digital cockpit |
| IoT/PC | Expanding beyond mobile |

---

## Competitive position

- [[Apple]] building in-house modems (threat)
- [[MediaTek]] competing on mid-range
- [[NVIDIA]] competing for automotive AI
- Fabless — depends on [[TSMC]] for manufacturing

---

## AI angle

- Snapdragon X Elite: On-device AI for PCs
- NPU (Neural Processing Unit) in mobile chips
- Edge inference play vs cloud-based AI
- Acquired Nuvia (Apple silicon veterans) for CPU cores

---

## Key risks

- Apple modem independence
- China exposure (Huawei was major customer pre-ban)
- Licensing model under regulatory pressure
