**Qualcomm** — Dominant mobile SoC and modem supplier. Snapdragon powers most Android phones. Pushing into automotive, PC, and AI inference.

---

## Why it matters

Qualcomm has:
- **Modem monopoly**: Only viable [[5G]] modem supplier (Apple trying to escape)
- **Snapdragon**: Leading Android SoC, [[Arm Holdings|ARM]]-based
- **Licensing**: Collects royalties on nearly all smartphones

![[qcom-vs-peers.png]]
*QCOM +230% since 2018 vs [[Semiconductors|SMH]] +800%. Tracked together through 2022, then SMH pulled away on AI/data center demand. QCOM's mobile focus missed the wave.*

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| QCT (chips) | Snapdragon SoCs, modems, RF front-end |
| QTL (licensing) | Patent royalties on 3G/4G/[[5G]] |
| [[Automotive]] | Snapdragon Ride, digital cockpit |
| IoT/PC | Expanding beyond mobile |

---

## Competitive position

- [[Apple]] building in-house modems (threat)
- [[MediaTek]] competing on mid-range
- [[NVIDIA]] competing for automotive AI
- Fabless — depends on [[TSMC]] for manufacturing

---

## AI angle

- Snapdragon X Elite: On-device AI for PCs
- [[NPU]] (Neural Processing Unit) in mobile chips
- Edge inference play vs cloud-based AI
- Acquired [[Nuvia]] ([[Apple]] silicon veterans) for CPU cores

## Financials

![[qcom-fundamentals.png]]
*QCOM quarterly revenue and net income. FY2018 net income trough from tax/legal charges. Revenue doubled from pre-[[5G]] levels (~$6B/quarter) to $12B+ by Q1 FY2026.*

### Annual (10 years, fiscal year ends Sep)

| FY | Revenue | Net Income | EPS | Stock Price |
|----|---------|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2016 | $23.6B | $5.7B | $3.81 | $66 |
| 2017 | $22.3B | $2.5B | $1.65 | $52 |

## Snapdragon X2 (Jan 2026)

**Next-gen PC chip — first commercial use of TSMC N3X:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Product | Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme |
| Process | **TSMC 3nm N3X** (first commercial chip) |
| Transistors | 31 billion |
| Cores | 18 (5.0GHz on 1-2 cores) |
| Memory bandwidth | 228GB/s |
| Power | 100W+ unconstrained, 40W sustained |
| Architecture | SiP (System-in-Package) — unified memory like Apple |

**N3X trade-offs:**

| N3X advantage | N3X disadvantage |
|---------------|------------------|
| +5% performance vs N3P | Lower efficiency |
| Optimized for >1.0V | Lower density |
| Max clock speeds | Higher power draw |

**vs Apple (early benchmarks):**

| Metric | X2 Elite Extreme | Apple |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Memory bandwidth | 228GB/s | M5: lower, M4 Pro: 273GB/s |
| Cinebench 2024 | Slower | M4 Max faster |
| GPU (3DMark) | — | M4 Pro ~45% faster |

**Assessment:** Qualcomm prioritized peak performance over efficiency. Still trailing Apple despite N3X. The SiP architecture is the right direction but execution gap remains.

## Q1 FY2026 earnings (Feb 4, 2026)

**Record quarter — but memory constraints cloud outlook:**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Revenue | **$12.3B** (record) | Beat $12.21B est. |
| Non-GAAP EPS | **$3.50** | Beat $3.41 est. |
| QCT (chips) | $10.6B | Flagship handset + auto strength |
| QCT Handsets | $7.8B | +3% YoY, premium segment sell-through |
| QCT [[Automotive]] | $1.1B | +15% YoY, Snapdragon digital chassis |
| QCT IoT | $1.7B | +9% YoY |
| QTL (licensing) | $1.6B | +4% YoY, 77% EBT margin |

**Q2 FY2026 guidance:** Revenue $10.2B-$11.0B, EPS $2.45-$2.65 — below Street $11.0B/$2.87.

**Stock reaction:** -8.5% (Feb 4-5). Beat on earnings, sold on guidance.

**Memory constraint (key risk):** DRAM suppliers redirecting capacity to [[HBM]] for AI data centers → industry-wide memory shortage and price increases constraining the handset market through FY2026. This is the same [[HBM]] demand surge benefiting [[SK Hynix]] and [[Micron]] but squeezing downstream OEMs.

**CEO Amon:** "Can't really predict if this will continue for '27 or '28." Several OEMs, especially in [[China]], reducing build plans.

**Samsung Galaxy S26:** Qualcomm expects "approximately 75% share" — validation of premium handset positioning.

**Acquisitions completed:**
- **[[Alphawave Semi]]** — high-speed wired connectivity IP
- **Ventana Micro Systems** — RISC-V computing (reduces ARM dependency)

## Foundry diversification (Jan 2026)

**Exploring Samsung as alternative to TSMC:**

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Reason | TSMC capacity constraints |
| Samsung process | SF2 (2nm) |
| Status | Exploring (not confirmed) |
| Category | "Spill-off" customer from TSMC overflow |

See [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]] for context on TSMC overflow.

## TCJA repatriation (2018)

Qualcomm repatriated ~$30B under the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] one-time tax holiday. Deployed into buybacks and the attempted [[NXP]] acquisition (blocked by [[China]]).

---

## Key events

### NXP acquisition blocked (2018)

Qualcomm's $44B bid for [[NXP]] was blocked when [[China]] withheld antitrust approval during the [[US-China trade]] war. See [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]].

**Impact on Qualcomm:**
- Lost automotive/IoT diversification opportunity
- Paid $2B breakup fee
- Remained concentrated in mobile (Apple dependency)
- Demonstrated vulnerability to [[Weaponized antitrust]]
