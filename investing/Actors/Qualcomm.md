**Qualcomm** — Dominant mobile SoC and modem supplier. Snapdragon powers most Android phones. Pushing into automotive, PC, and AI inference.

---

## Why it matters

Qualcomm has:
- **Modem monopoly**: Only viable 5G modem supplier (Apple trying to escape)
- **Snapdragon**: Leading Android SoC, ARM-based
- **Licensing**: Collects royalties on nearly all smartphones

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| QCT (chips) | Snapdragon SoCs, modems, RF front-end |
| QTL (licensing) | Patent royalties on 3G/4G/5G |
| Automotive | Snapdragon Ride, digital cockpit |
| IoT/PC | Expanding beyond mobile |

---

## Competitive position

- [[Apple]] building in-house modems (threat)
- [[MediaTek]] competing on mid-range
- [[NVIDIA]] competing for automotive AI
- Fabless — depends on [[TSMC]] for manufacturing

---

## AI angle

- Snapdragon X Elite: On-device AI for PCs
- NPU (Neural Processing Unit) in mobile chips
- Edge inference play vs cloud-based AI
- Acquired Nuvia (Apple silicon veterans) for CPU cores

---

## Snapdragon X2 (Jan 2026)

**Next-gen PC chip using TSMC N3X:**

| Spec | Details |
|------|---------|
| Product | Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme |
| Process | TSMC 3nm N3X |
| Focus | Maximum clock speeds |
| Trade-off | Power/thermal vs performance |

N3X = high-performance variant of TSMC 3nm, optimized for clock speed over efficiency.

---

## Foundry diversification (Jan 2026)

**Exploring Samsung as alternative to TSMC:**

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Reason | TSMC capacity constraints |
| Samsung process | SF2 (2nm) |
| Status | Exploring (not confirmed) |
| Category | "Spill-off" customer from TSMC overflow |

See [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]] for context on TSMC overflow.

## Key events

### NXP acquisition blocked (2018)

Qualcomm's $44B bid for [[NXP]] was blocked when China withheld antitrust approval during the US-China trade war. See [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]].

**Impact on Qualcomm:**
- Lost automotive/IoT diversification opportunity
- Paid $2B breakup fee
- Remained concentrated in mobile (Apple dependency)
- Demonstrated vulnerability to [[Weaponized antitrust]]

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | QCOM (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$180B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$40B |
| QCT (chips) revenue | ~$33B |
| QTL (licensing) revenue | ~$6B |
| Gross margin | ~56% |
| P/E | ~18x |
| Dividend yield | ~2% |

---

## Key risks

- Apple modem independence
- China exposure (Huawei was major customer pre-ban)
- Licensing model under regulatory pressure
- Geopolitical risk on future M&A (see [[Weaponized antitrust]])
