## Why Constellation matters

Nuclear renaissance for AI:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | CEG |
| Market cap | ~$75B |
| Nuclear fleet | 21 reactors |
| Capacity | ~23 GW |
| 2024 return | +150%+ |

## Microsoft Three Mile Island deal

**Landmark agreement (Sept 2024):**
- Restart TMI Unit 1
- 20-year PPA with Microsoft
- 835 MW dedicated power
- $1.6B investment to restart
- Operational by 2028

First nuclear restart for AI demand.

## Nuclear fleet

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reactors | 21 |
| States | IL, PA, NY, MD, NJ |
| Generation | ~10% of US nuclear |
| Capacity factor | 90%+ |

Largest nuclear operator in America.

## AI data center demand

**Why nuclear for AI:**
- 24/7 baseload power
- Zero carbon emissions
- Data centers need reliability
- PPA structures attractive

---

## Hyperscaler interest

| Company | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [[Microsoft]] | TMI deal signed (2024) |
| [[Amazon]] | Talen Energy deal |
| [[Google]] | Exploring nuclear |
| **[[Meta]]** | **$10B Louisiana data center** (Jan 2026) |

**Meta deal (Jan 2026):** Constellation supplying power for Meta's $10B AI data center in Louisiana. Part of Meta's plan to secure up to 6.6 GW of nuclear by 2035.

Everyone wants nuclear now.

## Valuation surge

**2024 re-rating:**
- Started 2024: ~$100/share
- End 2024: ~$250+/share
- TMI deal catalyst
- AI power narrative

Nuclear + AI = powerful theme.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Largest nuclear fleet
- Microsoft anchor deal
- AI power demand secular
- Zero carbon premium
- Regulatory tailwinds

**Bear:**
- High valuation now
- Execution risk (TMI restart)
- Nuclear regulatory complexity
- Political risks
- **BYOG policy risk** — PJM proposals could limit deals for existing capacity

## PJM BYOG risk (Jan 2026)

PJM's "Bring Your Own Generation" proposal threatens incumbent generators:

| Proposal | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Expedited interconnection** | Only for *new* capacity that offsets large loads |
| **Curtailment risk** | New large loads without matching generation can be switched off |
| **Capacity auction reform** | June deadline to study alternatives |

**Translation:** Era of hyperscalers buying existing nuclear capacity at premium prices may be ending. PJM wants Big Tech to bring new power, not commandeer the existing grid.

**Market reaction:** Constellation shares fell sharply on Jan 17 alongside [[Vistra]] and [[Talen Energy]] when PJM released these proposals.
