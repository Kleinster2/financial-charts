## Anta turnaround plan

Anta's 3-5 year turnaround strategy:
- Leverage China distribution network (where Anta has strongest capabilities)
- Integrate with outdoor brand portfolio ([[Descente]], [[Kolon Sport]])
- Address inventory turnover and discount-heavy reputation
- Potential brand overlap concern — Anta rebranded its "champion stores" to outdoor focus in early 2024, raising cannibalization questions

Challenges: Chinese consumers increasingly view Jack Wolfskin as an "outlet brand" due to constant discounting. Competitors like [[The North Face]] and Kailas have expanded in China.
