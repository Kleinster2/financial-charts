## Capacity crisis (2025)

Catastrophic failure of Aguirre Unit 1 created a critical generation shortfall. Genera filed an emergency request with [[PREB]] in Feb 2025 for:
- 800 MW of temporary mobile generators (18 months)
- Substitution with pre-owned functional units
- Deployment of generation barges

[[PREB]] responded in Mar 2025 with two orders:
1. Emergency procurement of 700-850 MW temporary generation
2. Long-term competitive solicitation for 2,500-3,000 MW new baseload (units preferably ≤400 MW, near load centers)
