## Panama Canal ports — APM Terminals tapped to replace [[CK Hutchison]] (Feb 2026)

Panama authorities asked APM Terminals (Maersk subsidiary) to temporarily take over operations of Balboa and Cristóbal ports after the Supreme Court ruled [[CK Hutchison]]'s concession unconstitutional.

- [[CK Hutchison]] threatened legal action against Maersk (Feb 12, 2026)
- APM Terminals said it was not party to the legal dispute — offered to step in "to mitigate risks to essential services for regional and global trade"
- Maersk shares fell 3%+ in Copenhagen on the news
- Geopolitical flashpoint: US-China proxy battle, with Panama caught between

Risk: legal liability from CKH arbitration. Opportunity: operating two of the world's most strategic port positions.

- Decarbonization leader

**Bear:**
