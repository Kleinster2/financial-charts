## How it works

Akkadian buys secondary market shares in private companies from existing backers — typically early employees, angels, or small funds seeking liquidity before an IPO. These are packaged into fund vehicles (SPVs, blind pool funds, and now the listed [[Powerlaw Corp]]). Instruments include direct equity, employee share buyouts, SPVs, forward contracts, and convertible notes.

Investment Committee: Black + Dinsdale. Also manage 14–17 other pooled vehicles at Akkadian with ~$800–857M in assets. No dedicated investment allocation — uses rotational/percentage allocation methods.

**Conflict:** Other Akkadian funds may have performance fees/carried interest, creating incentive to favor those over [[Powerlaw Corp]] (which has no performance fee).
