| [[Exxon]] | Largest exposure, Guyana = growth engine |
| Hess | Chevron acquiring (Guyana asset key) |
| [[CNOOC]] | 25% stake, China exposure |
| Offshore drillers | [[Transocean]], [[Valaris]] demand |
| FPSOs | [[TechnipFMC]], SBM Offshore |

**Chevron-Hess deal:** Chevron acquiring Hess primarily for Guyana stake.
