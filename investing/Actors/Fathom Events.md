# Fathom Events

Alternative content distributor for US cinemas. Brings opera, anime, classic films, concerts, and special screenings to movie theaters. Ranked 9th largest US distributor by box office.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2002 (spun out of National CineMedia in 2013) |
| HQ | Denver, CO |
| Ownership | JV: **AMC** (32%), **Cinemark** (32%), **Regal/Cineworld** (32%), NCM (4%) |
| Status | Private (jointly owned by Big 3 US exhibitors) |
| Reach | 2,000+ theaters across the US |

## What they do

Fathom fills empty theater seats on off-peak days with "event cinema" — content that isn't traditional Hollywood releases:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Opera/ballet** | Met Opera HD Live, Royal Ballet, Bolshoi |
| **Anime** | Dragon Ball, One Piece, Studio Ghibli re-releases |
| **Classic films** | Big Screen Classics series (2026 lineup announced) |
| **Concerts/music** | Live concert broadcasts, music documentaries |
| **Faith-based** | Christian films, special screenings |
| **Sports** | WWE, UFC special events |

## Business model

- Books 1-3 day limited engagements across the Big 3 chains
- Higher ticket prices than standard films ($15-25 vs $12-15)
- Low marketing cost — niche audiences self-select
- Fills midweek/matinee slots that would otherwise be empty
- Content partners handle production; Fathom handles distribution

## Strategic value

The JV structure is clever — AMC, Cinemark, and Regal collectively own the distributor, so they capture margin on both sides (exhibition + distribution). For the chains, Fathom is incremental revenue on otherwise dead screen time.
