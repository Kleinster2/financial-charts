## Venezuela — exclusive US license

**Chevron stayed when others left:**

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 2007 | Chavez nationalized — Chevron accepted minority role |
| 2019 | Trump sanctions — limited wind-down license |
| 2022 | Biden granted full operating license |
| 2023+ | Ramping production, ~200K bpd potential |
| **Jan 2026** | **US captures Maduro — operations uncertain** |

**Why Chevron stayed:**
- Bet on eventual normalization
- Maintained PDVSA relationships
- Now only US company with access

**January 2026 development:** US military strike captured Maduro. Trump announced US will "run" Venezuela and take control of oil reserves. American companies to invest billions to rebuild industry.

**Chevron's position:** Only US company currently operating — unique positioning but uncertain status during transition.

**Upside:** If transition stabilizes, Chevron best positioned to expand. Trump seeking US company investment.

**Risk:** Near-term operational disruption, potential competition from returning majors (Exxon?).
