## Q2 FY26 earnings (Feb 3, 2026)

**Blowout revenue, margin pressure. Stock +5% after hours.**

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $12.7B | $10.34B |
| EPS (adj) | $0.69 | $0.49 |
| Revenue YoY | +123% | — |
| Revenue QoQ | +153% | — |
| Gross margin | **6.4%** | — |

**Guidance raised:**
- Q3 revenue: at least $12.3B (vs $10.2B expected)
- Q3 EPS: at least $0.60 (vs $0.52 expected)
- FY26 revenue: at least $40B (up from prior $33B guide)

**Key concerns:**
- **63% revenue concentration** — single hyperscaler customer
- Gross margin compressed to 6.4% (product mix, freight, production costs)
- Component shortages and pricing volatility

**Other:** Secured $2B revolving credit facility from [[JPMorgan]] through 2030.

Demand undeniable, but margin structure shows SMCI is a hardware assembler, not a chip designer.
