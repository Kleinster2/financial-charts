## Accounting controversy

**2024 issues:**
- Short seller report (Hindenburg)
- Delayed 10-K filing
- Auditor resigned (EY)
- DOJ inquiry reported
- Stock volatile

---

## The bull case

**Despite controversy:**
- Real products, real revenue
- NVIDIA relationship intact
- AI demand undeniable
- Liquid cooling differentiation
- Cheap if concerns overblown

---

## The bear case

**Serious concerns:**
- Accounting credibility
- Auditor departure = red flag
- DOJ inquiry
- Delisting risk
- Governance questions

---

## Competition

| Competitor | Supermicro vs |
|------------|---------------|
| Dell | Faster to market |
| HPE | More innovative |
| [[Lenovo]] | Liquid cooling lead |
| Inspur ([[China]]) | US alternative |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI server leader
- Liquid cooling moat
- Cheap on accounting fears
- NVIDIA partnership
- Demand undeniable

**Bear:**
- Accounting red flags
- Auditor resignation
- Potential fraud
- Delisting risk
- Governance concerns

High risk/high reward.

## Q2 FY26 earnings (Feb 3, 2026)

**Blowout revenue, margin pressure. Stock +5% after hours.**

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $12.7B | $10.34B |
| EPS (adj) | $0.69 | $0.49 |
| Revenue YoY | +123% | — |
| Revenue QoQ | +153% | — |
| Gross margin | **6.4%** | — |

**Guidance raised:**
- Q3 revenue: at least $12.3B (vs $10.2B expected)
- Q3 EPS: at least $0.60 (vs $0.52 expected)
- FY26 revenue: at least $40B (up from prior $33B guide)

**Key concerns:**
- **63% revenue concentration** — single hyperscaler customer
- Gross margin compressed to 6.4% (product mix, freight, production costs)
- Component shortages and pricing volatility

**Other:** Secured $2B revolving credit facility from [[JPMorgan]] through 2030.

## Business model reality

**Hardware assembler, not chip designer:**

| Company | Role | Gross margin |
|---------|------|--------------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Chip designer | ~73% |
| [[AMD]] | Chip designer | ~50% |
| **SMCI** | Server assembler | **6.4%** |
| [[Dell]] | Server assembler | ~22% |

SMCI buys NVIDIA GPUs at market price, adds motherboards/cooling/racks, sells to hyperscalers. The value-add is speed-to-market and liquid cooling integration — not proprietary silicon.

**Why margins are thin:**
- No IP moat on core components (GPUs, memory)
- Commodity server parts (motherboards, power supplies)
- Price competition from Dell, HPE
- Hyperscaler customers have negotiating power

**Why it still works:**
- First-mover on new GPU architectures
- Liquid cooling expertise (hard to replicate quickly)
- Volume + speed = market share
- $40B revenue at 6% margin = $2.4B gross profit

The bull case is volume growth outpacing margin compression. The bear case is Dell/HPE catching up on liquid cooling while hyperscalers squeeze pricing.
