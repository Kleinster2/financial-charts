### Bill Gates

- Gates: "absolutely absurd and completely false"
- Melinda Gates: "He needs to answer to those things"

### Peter Thiel
- Correspondence began 2014
- Meetings at Epstein's NY home, Thiel's SF office, Thiel's home
- Epstein asked about $100M Spotify investment at $5B valuation; Thiel said "hold off"
- Barak described Valar as "co-owned" by Thiel and Epstein (Thiel denies)

### Howard Lutnick

## Takeaways

### 1. Capital buys access, access buys legitimacy

Post-conviction playbook was systematic:
- Invest in elite funds (Renaissance, Valar) → credibility as "serious investor"
- Get intros to founders (Pierce → Coinbase, Barak → Thiel) → deal flow
- Host at properties (townhouse, island, ranch) → social proximity
- Donate to universities (Harvard, MIT) → intellectual legitimacy

A registered sex offender maintained Wall Street and Silicon Valley relationships for 11 years.

### 2. Due diligence theater

Everyone who took his money had a story:
- Valar: "well-known adviser to world leaders, universities"
- Renaissance: Invited weeks after indictment
- JPMorgan: Kept accounts 15 years despite red flags
- Deutsche Bank: Opened 40+ accounts after JPMorgan exited
- Harvard/MIT: Accepted donations post-conviction

Institutions performed just enough diligence for plausible deniability, not enough to say no.

### 3. The returns were real

| Investment | Return |
|------------|--------|
| Coinbase | $3M → $15M+ (5x) |
| Valar | $40M → $170M (4x) |
| Highbridge | $10M + $15M fee |
| D.B. Zwirn | $80M → $140M |

He wasn't a fraud as an investor. Real returns made it easier to rationalize the relationship.

### 4. Opacity as product

- Wealth source never explained publicly
- 30+ shell companies across USVI, BVI, Bermuda
- "Wealth management" with only 2 confirmed clients
- 90% tax exemption via offshore structure

The mystery was the product. Billionaires paid for discretion, not disclosed expertise.

### 5. Bitcoin development influence

Epstein's $525K to MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) funded three Bitcoin Core developers — Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields — after the Bitcoin Foundation's 2015 bankruptcy. Joichi Ito emailed Epstein: "This is a big win for us." Epstein replied about Andresen: "gavin is clever." DCI became the institutional home for Bitcoin's core maintainers, making an academic lab partially underwritten by a convicted sex offender the de facto paymaster of Bitcoin development. No evidence Epstein exercised protocol-level control, but the funding channel raises questions about institutional capture of a supposedly decentralized project.

### 6. Estate reveals priorities

| Recipient | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Victims | ~$170M |
| USVI/IRS | ~$185M (clawed back) |
| Beneficiaries (girlfriends, advisers) | ~$145M remaining |

Victims got less than the girlfriend. The $170M Valar stake goes to estate beneficiaries when it liquidates.

### 7. Proximity ≠ guilt, but ≠ innocence

The 2026 releases showed 20+ tech executives in correspondence. Important distinctions:
- **Investment relationships** (Thiel, Coinbase): Financial, documented, defensible
- **Social contact** (Musk's "wildest party" emails): Harder to explain
- **Advisory claims** (Gates meetings): Disputed but damaging

The documents created reputational exposure regardless of what actually happened.

---

**Bottom line:** Epstein exploited a system where money launders reputation. The same VCs, banks, and universities that trumpet ESG took his capital with minimal friction. The 2026 releases didn't reveal a conspiracy — they revealed how ordinary the access-for-capital exchange was.
