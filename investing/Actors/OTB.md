## Renzo Rosso

Founder and controlling shareholder. Built Diesel from 1978, created OTB as holding company in 2002 to acquire other brands.

**Philosophy:** Creative freedom for designers, long-term brand building over short-term profit.

**Acquisitions:**
- Maison Margiela (2002)
- Marni (2012)
- Viktor & Rolf (2008)
- Jil Sander (2021)
- Amiri stake (2019)

---

## Strategy

**Brand positioning:** Each brand maintains distinct identity — no cross-brand "synergies" that dilute positioning.

**Vertical integration:** Staff International provides manufacturing for group brands.

**Expansion (2025+):**
- 50 new stores over 5 years (15 in 2025)
- [[Mexico]]: new legal entity, LatAm expansion
- Middle East: 25-year JV with Chalhoub Group

---

## IPO plans

Targeting 2026 if market conditions improve. CEO Ubaldo Minelli: "on the agenda but we are in no rush." See [[2026 IPO pipeline]].

**Considerations:**
- Need better numbers after 2024 EBIT collapse
- [[Japan]] strength vs [[China]] weakness
- Margiela momentum post-Galliano transition
