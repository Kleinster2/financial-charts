## Fed Chair candidacy (resolved)

### Passed over for Warsh (Jan 30, 2026)

Trump nominated [[Kevin Warsh]] instead. Waller remains as Fed Governor (term through Jan 2030).

**Bessent meeting:** Had met with Treasury Secretary, who said Waller "fits the bill" for leadership.

**Jan 28, 2026 dissent:** Two days before the Warsh nomination, Waller dissented in favor of 25bp cut (joined [[Stephen Miran]]). First dissent since joining Board in 2020. Speculation that dissent was intended to bolster Fed Chair candidacy by signaling alignment with Trump's preference for lower rates — but it wasn't enough.
