## Technology

Coherent Distributed Networks (CDN) architecture enabling time-synchronous sensing, detection, communications, and effects across domains.

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| HYDRA | Flagship software-defined multi-domain platform (land, sea, air) |
| ASTRIA | Air and missile defense system (adapted for USAF) |

Core capability: networks of low-cost radar sensor nodes replacing monolithic legacy radar installations. Software-defined, rapidly deployable, over-the-air updatable. Key advantage: drone detection -- a vulnerability highlighted by the Ukraine war.

Acquired Ziva Corporation (wireless time synchronization) -- cornerstone technology for distributed radar and battlefield effects.

- Competing with [[Raytheon]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[L3Harris]] on radar
- Defense procurement cycles are slow
- $4.5B valuation on limited deployed contracts
