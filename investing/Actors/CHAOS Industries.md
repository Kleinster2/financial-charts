## Technology

Coherent Distributed Networks (CDN) architecture enabling time-synchronous sensing, detection, communications, and effects across domains.

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| HYDRA | Flagship software-defined multi-domain platform (land, sea, air) |
| ASTRIA | Air and missile defense system (adapted for USAF) |
| Vanquish | Dual-use radar system providing 10+ min more warning than traditional radars |

Core capability: networks of low-cost radar sensor nodes replacing monolithic legacy radar installations. Software-defined, rapidly deployable, over-the-air updatable. Key advantage: drone detection -- a vulnerability highlighted by the Ukraine war.

Acquired Ziva Corporation (wireless time synchronization) -- cornerstone technology for distributed radar and battlefield effects.

Partnership with [[Forterra]] for autonomous vehicle integration.

- [[George Tenet]] (former CIA Director) as Executive Chairman adds institutional credibility
- G-TEAD Marketplace selection opens NATO procurement pipeline

Bear:
- Pre-revenue at meaningful scale
