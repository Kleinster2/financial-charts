## Hoka

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | ~$2.4B (FY25) |
| Growth | +24% |
| Category | Performance running → lifestyle crossover |
| Innovation | [[Meta]]-Rocker, max cushion geometry |
| Competition | [[Nike]], [[On Running]], Brooks, [[New Balance]] |
| Risk | Running shoe cycle — can momentum sustain? |

Hoka created the "max cushion" category and crossed over from serious runners to lifestyle consumers. Similar trajectory to On Running but larger and earlier in the curve.

## UGG

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | ~$2.3B (FY25) |
| Growth | +13% |
| Gross margin | ~55%+ |
| Seasonality | Heavily Q3 (holiday) |
| Category | Comfort/lifestyle footwear |
| Innovation | Platform, Tazz, Ultra Mini (Gen Z hits) |

UGG was left for dead in 2017-2019, then reinvented itself through Gen Z cultural relevance (Tazz, Ultra Mini became viral). Now a $2.3B brand growing double-digits.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Two $2B+ brands with different growth drivers
- 72% gross margin — best in footwear
- Hoka still early in international expansion
- UGG renaissance — Gen Z adoption sustaining
- CEO transition complete (Caroti from Nike/Gucci)
- EPS doubling cadence continues

**Bear:**
- Stock -50% from peak — market questioning growth duration
- Hoka growth decelerating (32% → 28% → 24%)
- Running shoe cycles are historically fickle (Brooks, Asics had similar moments)
- UGG seasonal concentration (Q3 heavy)
- ~$600 stock = ~20x PE on $30 EPS — needs growth to justify
- Nike turnaround could compress performance running share
- International Hoka awareness still early (risk and opportunity)
