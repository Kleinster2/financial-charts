### vs peers

![[ifnny-vs-nxpi-vs-stm-price-chart.png]]
*Infineon (blue) vs [[NXP]] vs [[STMicro]] since 2022. Infineon and NXP both ~+10%, roughly tracking each other. STMicro has collapsed ~38% — worst among European auto/power semis, reflecting heavier auto exposure and lack of AI offset.*

## Why Infineon matters

Infineon is the global leader in two critical categories:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Auto semis | \#1 globally |
| Power semis | \#1 globally |
| EV exposure | Major beneficiary |
| European | German champion |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position | Share |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Automotive]] semiconductors | \#1 globally | ~13% |
| Power semiconductors | \#1 globally | ~20% |
| Security ICs | Top 3 | — |
| Industrial | Top 5 | — |

Double leadership in auto + power = unique position for [[EV transition]].

## Product portfolio

**Power semiconductors:**

| Technology | Applications |
|------------|--------------|
| IGBTs | EV inverters, industrial drives |
| MOSFETs | Power management |
| SiC | High-efficiency EVs |
| GaN | Fast chargers, data centers |

**[[Automotive]]:**

| Product | Applications |

## AI / data center pivot (Feb 2026)

Infineon is aggressively diversifying into AI infrastructure as auto/industrial demand stalls. CFO Sven Schneider called AI "the biggest growth driver in the history of the company."

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 AI/data center capex | ~€2.7B (up from €2.2B planned) |
| FY2026 data center revenue | ~€1.5B (~10% of sales) |
| FY2027 data center revenue target | €2.5B |
| AI sales growth | ~10x in three years (per CEO) |

Key products for AI: GaN power semiconductors for data center power delivery. Power management becoming critical as AI rack power density rises.

**Q1 FY2026 earnings (reported Feb 4, 2026):**

| Metric | Actual | Estimate |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | €3.66B | €3.62B |
| Adj. operating margin | 17.9% | 16.8% |
| Auto segment revenue | €1.8B | Slightly ahead |
| Q2 revenue guidance | ~€3.8B | €3.8B |
| Q2 margin guidance | Mid-to-high teens | 17.5% |

Auto/industrial described as "gone beyond the trough" but no real recovery yet. Company reiterated "moderate revenue growth" for full FY2026 (ending Sep 2026).

**[[AMS-OSRAM]] sensor deal:** Agreed to acquire automotive, industrial and medical sensor business for $673M cash. Expected ~€230M annual sales. Sensors detect movement, sound — used in vehicles, health trackers, robots.

**Peers:** [[STMicro]] CEO said auto market not yet "stable." [[NXP]] showed slightly slower auto growth than anticipated. Uneven recovery across European analog/power names.
