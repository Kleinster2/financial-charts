## Why Infineon matters

Infineon is the global leader in two critical categories:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Auto semis | #1 globally |
| Power semis | #1 globally |
| EV exposure | Major beneficiary |
| European | German champion |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position | Share |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Automotive semiconductors | #1 globally | ~13% |
| Power semiconductors | #1 globally | ~20% |
| Security ICs | Top 3 | — |
| Industrial | Top 5 | — |

Double leadership in auto + power = unique position for EV transition.

## Product portfolio

**Power semiconductors:**

| Technology | Applications |
|------------|--------------|
| IGBTs | EV inverters, industrial drives |
| MOSFETs | Power management |
| SiC | High-efficiency EVs |
| GaN | Fast chargers, data centers |

**Automotive:**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| MCUs | Engine control, body |
| Power | EV drivetrain |
| Sensors | ADAS, radar |
| Security | V2X, authentication |

---

## EV transition beneficiary

**More content per EV:**

| Vehicle type | Infineon content |
|--------------|------------------|
| ICE vehicle | ~$50 |
| Hybrid | ~$150 |
| BEV | ~$200+ |

EVs = 4x the semiconductor content of ICE. Infineon's power focus = maximum leverage.

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| [[Tesla]] | Power semiconductors |
| VW Group | Full portfolio |
| BMW | Power, MCUs |
| Toyota | Power, sensors |
| Tier 1s | Bosch, Continental, Denso |

Broad OEM and Tier 1 relationships.

---

## Manufacturing

**Owned fabs (power focus):**

| Location | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Dresden, Germany | Power, automotive |
| Villach, Austria | Power (new 300mm) |
| Kulim, Malaysia | Power (expanding) |
| Regensburg, Germany | Automotive |

Power semis less node-dependent = own fabs viable.

**Foundry partners:** [[TSMC]], [[GlobalFoundries]] for advanced logic.
