Acquired by [[Nelson Tanure]] in 2013, pivoted from exploration to mature-field acquisition, renamed PetroRio (2015), then PRIO (2022).

## Evolution

- 2009 — Founded as HRT Participacoes with the promise of finding oil in the Amazon and Namibia
- 2010 — IPO on B3, raising R$2.6B. Beijaflor samba school passistas danced on the exchange floor
- 2010-2013 — Spent heavily on exploration without finding commercially viable oil. Stock fell 97%
- 2013 — [[Nelson Tanure]] began buying at ~R$0.36/share when the company was valued below its remaining cash. Built a 20% stake, fought American hedge funds ([[Farallon Capital|Discover Capital]]) for control, and won
- 2014-2015 — Strategic pivot: abandoned greenfield exploration entirely. Began acquiring mature fields that majors like [[Petrobras]] were abandoning — too small for their scale but profitable with lean operations and modern extraction tech. Renamed PetroRio (2015)
- 2015-2025 — Continued acquiring and optimizing mature fields. Production grew from ~5,000 to ~155,000 boepd (including Nov 2025 Peregrino acquisition). Stock from ~R$0.36 to >R$50 (>117x). Renamed PRIO (2022)
- Jan 2026 — Tanure's 17% stake, pledged as collateral to [[Credit Suisse]] (now [[UBS]]), was liquidated when UBS sought to reduce Tanure exposure. Son Nelson Queiroz Tanure continues as chairman, operationally independent from father's troubles
