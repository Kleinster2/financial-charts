## Fed Chair candidacy

### "Battle of the Kevins"

| Metric | Hassett | [[Kevin Warsh]] |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Kalshi odds (Jan 16) | **16%** | **60%** |
| Trump proximity | Daily contact (NEC) | Distant |
| Independence perception | Lower | Higher |
| Market credibility | Lower | Higher |

**Jan 16 shift:** Trump publicly said he wants Hassett to stay at NEC. Warsh now clear front-runner.

### Market reaction (Jan 16)

| Metric | Move |
|--------|------|
| 10Y yield | 3.96% → 4.02% (+6bp) |
| Hassett odds | 80%+ peak → 16% |

Curve steepened — market pricing fewer cuts under Warsh.

**Evercore:** Powell investigation "making it harder to confirm Hassett, who is distinctively close to the president. Warsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm."

### Hassett advantages

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Trump relationship | Daily conversations, high trust |
| Current position | Already in administration |
| Political experience | Multiple campaigns, two Trump terms |
| Academic credentials | PhD economics, former professor |

### Hassett concerns

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Independence | Too close to Trump — markets worried |
| Fed experience | Brief stint as staffer, never on Board |
| Market credibility | Less than Warsh (no Wall Street background) |
| Past predictions | Some forecasts didn't pan out |

## Trump's view

**Dec 2025:** "I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great."

Hassett has advantage of daily access and established trust, but Trump aware of market concerns about independence.

## Market view

Investors concerned that Hassett's proximity to Trump would compromise [[Fed independence]]:
- Daily White House contact raises autonomy questions
- No institutional buffer between president and Fed
- Could lead to politically-timed rate decisions
- Bond vigilante risk if credibility erodes
