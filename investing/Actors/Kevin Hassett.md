## Fed Chair candidacy (resolved)

| Jan 16 | 16% odds — Trump signals he wants Hassett to stay at NEC |
| **Jan 30** | **Warsh nominated** — Hassett passed over |

### Why Hassett lost

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Independence | Too close to Trump — markets worried |
| Fed experience | Brief stint as staffer, never on Board |
| Market credibility | Less than Warsh (no Wall Street background) |
| Confirmation risk | Evercore: "harder to confirm... distinctively close to the president" |

## Trump's view

**Dec 2025:** "I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great."
