## Medallion Fund

The crown jewel — and most successful hedge fund ever.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launched | 1988 |
| Access | **Employees only** (closed to outsiders) |
| AUM | ~$15B (capped) |
| Gross annual return | ~66% average |
| Net annual return | ~39% average (after 5/44 fees) |
| Fee structure | 5% management + 44% performance |
| Losing years | 1 (1989, minor) |

### Performance context

| Comparison | Medallion | S&P 500 |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 1988-2023 average | ~39% net | ~10% |
| 2020 (pandemic) | +76% | +18% |

**$1 invested in 1988** in Medallion would be worth >$40,000 by 2023 (vs ~$40 in S&P 500).

### Why employees only?

- Capacity constrained — strategies work at limited scale
- Returns capital annually to maintain size
- Employees incentivized to stay

## External funds

Open to outside investors — but vastly underperform Medallion.

| Fund | AUM | Access | Returns |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| **RIEF** (Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund) | $60B+ | External | Market-like |
| **RIDA** (Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha) | $30B+ | External | Market-like |
| **RIDGE** (Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equity) | $20B+ | External | Market-like |

**The gap**: External funds return ~market; Medallion returns 4x market. The best strategies are reserved for employees.

## Key people

| Person | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Jim Simons | Founder | Died May 2024 |
| **Peter Brown** | CEO | Joined 1993 (from [[IBM]]); co-CEO since 2010, sole CEO since 2017 |
| **Robert Mercer** | Former co-CEO | Joined 1993 (from [[IBM]]); resigned 2017 over political controversy |
| Henry Laufer | Chief Scientist | Key figure in signal development |

### Brown & Mercer

### Robert Mercer controversy

Major Republican donor (Steve Bannon, Breitbart, Trump). Resigned as co-CEO in 2017 amid political backlash. Remains significant shareholder.

## Philosophy & culture

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Hire scientists | Mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists — not finance people |
| Pure quant | No fundamental analysis |
| Thousands of signals | Diverse predictive patterns |
| Extreme secrecy | Methods never disclosed |
| Long-term employment | Generous comp, but strict non-competes |

## IRS settlement (2021)

| Detail | Value |

## Epstein investment

Jeffrey Epstein invested in Renaissance via a Citigroup feeder fund:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | August 2006 |
| Amount | $1M |
| Vehicle | Citigroup/Smith Barney feeder fund |
| Context | Weeks after Epstein charged with soliciting prostitution |

Greg Hersch, a wealth manager at Smith Barney, invited Epstein to invest as the fund neared its 499-investor cap. Epstein's Financial Trust Company made the investment.

**Note:** This was an external fund (likely RIEF), not the employees-only Medallion Fund. Renaissance's external funds accept outside capital; Medallion has been closed to outsiders since 1993.

## Political donations

Renaissance employees span political spectrum:

| Person | Affiliation | Notable donations |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Jim Simons | Democrat | $26M+ to Democrats (2016) |
| Robert Mercer | Republican | $25M+ to Republicans (2016); Breitbart, Trump |

---

## Historical significance

| Achievement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Proved quant works | Systematic trading can beat markets long-term |
| Inspired industry | Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, countless others |
| Best track record | Outperformed Buffett, Soros, everyone |
| Talent pipeline | Defined quant hiring: PhDs, not MBAs |

---

## Investment relevance

**Why track Renaissance**:

1. **[[Benchmark]]** — Medallion is the gold standard. All quants compared to it.

2. **Signals for quant health** — When external funds (RIEF, RIDA) struggle, it signals quant crowding.

3. **Mercer influence** — Despite resignation, Mercer's political activity and wealth from Renaissance remains significant.

4. **Post-Simons era** — Simons died May 2024. Watch for any changes in performance or culture.

5. **Tax/regulatory risk** — $7B IRS settlement shows aggressive tax strategies can backfire.
