## Investment case

Bull:
- Dominant position in Brazilian retail investment distribution (~11% share, growing)
- IFA network model is a moat — 18,000 advisors locked into XP infrastructure
- Credit expansion (+27% YoY) adds NII growth on top of fee income
- 24% ROAE with capital returns (R$2.4B in FY2025)
- "One XP" strategy integrating banking + investments + insurance + credit

Bear:
- Brazil macro headwinds — high Selic rate environment pressures equity inflows
- Client growth stalling (4.7M → 4.8M, +2% YoY) — saturation of addressable market?
- Net inflows declining (R$94B vs R$108B prior year, -13%)
- [[BTG Pactual]] overtaking on net retail inflows (R$30B vs XP's R$20B in Q4 2024)
- Dual-class structure concentrates control with Benchimol
