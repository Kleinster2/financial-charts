**GigaDevice** — Chinese memory chip designer. Shanghai-listed, seeking $1B Hong Kong secondary listing (Jan 2026).

## Why GigaDevice matters

Memory chip leader seeking international capital:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Primary listing | Shanghai |
| Secondary listing | Hong Kong ($1B, Jan 2026) |
| Focus | Memory chips, micro-controllers |
| End markets | Consumer electronics, industrial, automotive |

---

## Product focus

**Memory chips:**
- NOR flash memory
- NAND flash memory

**Micro-controllers (MCUs):**
- Widely used in consumer electronics
- Industrial applications
- Automotive applications

Different focus than GPU-focused Four Little Dragons — memory and MCUs rather than AI accelerators.

- HK listing = international investor access

**Bear:**
- Not pure AI play
- Competing with Samsung, SK Hynix in memory
- Export control risk for advanced chips
- Valuation after strong 2024 run
