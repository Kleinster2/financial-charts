**Japan** — World's 4th largest economy. Key US ally in Indo-Pacific. Remilitarizing amid [[China]] tensions.

---

## Why Japan matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$4.2T (#4 globally) |
| [[Defense]] budget | 9T yen ($57.4B) in 2026, +3.8% YoY |
| US alliance | Treaty ally since 1951 |
| Key tension | [[China]] (Taiwan, Senkaku/Diaoyu) |

## Key indices

| Index | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Nikkei 225 | Blue chips |
| TOPIX | Broad market |
| JPX-Nikkei 400 | Governance focus |

---

## Government

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PM | Sanae Takaichi | Conservative, hawkish on [[China]] |
| Party | LDP | Dominant since 1955 |

**Takaichi stance:** Said Taiwan "contingency" could threaten Japan's security and necessitate military response. Triggered major [[China]] retaliation (Jan 2026).

---

## [[China]] relations

See [[China-Japan relations]] for full analysis.

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Major escalation.

| [[China]] action | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Export ban | Dual-use equipment, rare earths, semiconductors |
| Anti-dumping probe | Dichlorosilane (chip manufacturing) |
| Soft pressure | Canceled business delegation, travel restrictions |

**Trigger:** Takaichi's Taiwan comments. [[China]] views as interference; wants her out.

## Rare earth independence

See [[Japan Chikyu rare earth mission 2026-01]].

**The problem**: Japan 60% dependent on [[China]] for rare earths (down from 90% in 2010). Almost 100% dependent for heavy REEs like [[Dysprosium]].

**The solution**: Minamitori Island deep-sea mining project.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | 40B yen ($250M) since 2018 |
| Current phase | Test mission (Jan-Feb 2026) |
| Next phase | Full mining trial (Feb 2027) |
| Depth | ~6 km (world first) |

**Diversification to date**:
- Sojitz/Lynas partnership (Australian rare earths)
- Recycling programs
- Manufacturing processes using less REE

---

## [[Defense]] posture

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Defense]] budget | Record 9T yen, doubling by 2027 target |
| Counterstrike capability | Acquiring long-range missiles |
| US bases | Okinawa, Yokosuka, Misawa, others |
| [[AUKUS]] coordination | Observer status discussions |

**Shift:** Post-WWII pacifism eroding. Constitutional reinterpretation allows collective self-defense (2014).

## Semiconductor strategy

See [[Japan Semiconductor Revival]].

### FY2026 budget (Jan 2026)

**Japan quadrupling AI/semiconductor spending:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 budget | **¥1.23T ($7.9B)** |
| vs previous | **~4x increase** |
| Rapidus allocation | ¥150B (total now ¥250B) |
| Focus | Advanced semiconductors, AI |

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's cabinet approved the draft budget. Parliamentary deliberations ongoing.

### Key initiatives

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Rapidus]] | 2nm fab with [[IBM]], IMEC — mass production target 2027, ¥250B govt investment |
| [[TSMC]] Japan | Kumamoto fab operational, 60% local procurement |
| Equipment | [[Tokyo Electron]], Screen Holdings |
| Materials | JSR, [[Shin-Etsu]] dominant |
| Strategy pivot | [[Advanced packaging]] (vs competing with [[TSMC]] on lithography)

### [[China]] anti-dumping probe (Jan 7, 2026)

[[China]] investigating Japanese dichlorosilane imports — key semiconductor manufacturing chemical. Japan controls 72% of [[China]]'s domestic supply (2022-2024 average). Probe covers Jul 2024 - Jun 2025.

**Strategic significance:** Potential retaliation tool in tech war. Japan's three leading producers (Tokuyama, Mitsubishi Chemical, [[Shin-Etsu]]) dominate global supply. If [[China]] imposes duties, must find alternatives or develop domestic capacity.

## Nuclear restart

**Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 restart (Jan 2026):** TEPCO restarted first reactor at world's largest nuclear complex (7 units, 8.2 GW total capacity). First TEPCO nuclear operation since Fukushima (2011).

**Significance:**
- Before 2011, nuclear = ~30% of Japan's electricity
- Currently nuclear = ~7% (only 12 of 33 operable reactors running)
- Energy security critical for semiconductor manufacturing (power-intensive)
- Reduces [[LNG]] import dependence

**Remaining capacity:** If all operable reactors restart, Japan could recover ~20% of electricity from nuclear. Political and safety hurdles remain significant.

## Key companies

| Sector | Companies |
|--------|-----------|
| Autos | [[Toyota]], Honda, Nissan |
| [[Semiconductors]] | [[Tokyo Electron]], [[Renesas]], Screen |
| Electronics | [[Sony]], [[Panasonic]], Keyence |
| Trading | Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu |
| [[Defense]] | Mitsubishi Heavy, Kawasaki Heavy |

---

## Investment relevance

**Themes:**
- [[Defense]] spending increase → MHI, Kawasaki Heavy
- Semiconductor revival → [[Tokyo Electron]], equipment suppliers
- Yen weakness → exporters benefit
- [[China]] decoupling risk → supply chain disruption

**Risks:**
- [[China]] retaliation (rare earths, tourism, trade)
- Demographic decline
- Government debt (~260% of GDP)
