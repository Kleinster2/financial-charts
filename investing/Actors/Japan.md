## Why Japan matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$4.2T (#4 globally) |
| Defense budget | 9T yen ($57.4B) in 2026, +3.8% YoY |
| US alliance | Treaty ally since 1951 |
| Key tension | China (Taiwan, Senkaku/Diaoyu) |

---

## Government

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PM | Sanae Takaichi | Conservative, hawkish on China |
| Party | LDP | Dominant since 1955 |

**Takaichi stance:** Said Taiwan "contingency" could threaten Japan's security and necessitate military response. Triggered major China retaliation (Jan 2026).

## China relations

See [[China-Japan relations]] for full analysis.

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Major escalation.

| China action | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Export ban | Dual-use equipment, rare earths, semiconductors |
| Anti-dumping probe | Dichlorosilane (chip manufacturing) |
| Soft pressure | Canceled business delegation, travel restrictions |

**Trigger:** Takaichi's Taiwan comments. China views as interference; wants her out.

---

## Defense posture

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Defense budget | Record 9T yen, doubling by 2027 target |
| Counterstrike capability | Acquiring long-range missiles |
| US bases | Okinawa, Yokosuka, Misawa, others |
| AUKUS coordination | Observer status discussions |

**Shift:** Post-WWII pacifism eroding. Constitutional reinterpretation allows collective self-defense (2014).

## Semiconductor strategy

See [[Japan Semiconductor Revival]].

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Rapidus | 2nm fab with IBM, IMEC |
| TSMC Japan | Kumamoto fab operational |
| Equipment | Tokyo Electron, Screen Holdings |
| Materials | JSR, Shin-Etsu dominant |

---

## Key companies

| Sector | Companies |
|--------|-----------|
| Autos | [[Toyota]], Honda, Nissan |
| Semiconductors | Tokyo Electron, Renesas, Screen |
| Electronics | Sony, Panasonic, Keyence |
| Trading | Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu |
| Defense | Mitsubishi Heavy, Kawasaki Heavy |

---

## Investment relevance

**Themes:**
- Defense spending increase → MHI, Kawasaki Heavy
- Semiconductor revival → Tokyo Electron, equipment suppliers
- Yen weakness → exporters benefit
- China decoupling risk → supply chain disruption

**Risks:**
- China retaliation (rare earths, tourism, trade)
- Demographic decline
- Government debt (~260% of GDP)
