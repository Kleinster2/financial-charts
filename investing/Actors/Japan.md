# Japan

The world's fourth-largest economy ($4.2T GDP, 2024), emerging from three "lost decades" of deflation and stagnation into a reflationary regime. [[Nikkei 225]] hit 58,000 in Feb 2026 — a 49% gain from its Feb 2024 breakout above the 1989 bubble high. The structural story: returning inflation, [[BOJ]] rate normalization, corporate governance revolution, and political stability under PM [[Sanae Takaichi]].

## Why now — the lost decades exit

Three decades of deflation ended when external shocks (Covid supply chains, Ukraine energy crisis) forced Japanese corporates to pass costs to consumers for the first time. CPI went from zero/negative to ~3%. This broke the deflationary psychology: cash went from king to worst asset. The [[BOJ]] under Governor [[Kazuo Ueda]] began normalizing rates — first hike in 17 years (Mar 2024), policy rate now 0.75% with [[Vanguard]] projecting 1.25% by end-2026.

[[Eiji Ueda]] ([[Apollo]] Asia Pacific head, ex-[[GPIF]]/[[Goldman Sachs]]): the deflation-to-inflation shift is economic, not cultural. Japanese investors held cash for 30 years because it was the rational choice in a deflationary environment. With 3% inflation, "cash is the worst asset to own" — capital will move.

### Household savings — the great rotation

Japanese households sit on **¥2,000 trillion** (~$13T+) in financial assets — the world's largest savings pool. Cash and deposits fell from ~55% of household assets (2022) to ~50% (2024), while equity exposure crept up to 14%. This reallocation is just beginning. [[Apollo]]'s [[Marc Rowan]]: "That savings is going to be deployed productively."

### Corporate governance revolution

The [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] under CEO [[Hiromi Yamaji]] implemented aggressive governance reforms starting 2023: demanding companies trading below book value explain why, pushing cross-shareholding unwinding, mandating independent directors. Result: record buybacks (¥35T in 2025), rising ROE, and more than half of listed companies now above book value. See [[Japan corporate governance revolution]].

**Delistings accelerating**: previously ~50 companies per year delisted. In 2025, 125 companies delisted. In 2026, 16 have already announced — companies are "scrutinizing whether listing is the best path for growth" (Yamaji). Simultaneously, 280 carve-outs and spin-offs in H1 2025 alone (record), totaling ¥35T in deal volume.

**Corporate Japan receptive to change**: companies actively investing in AI, automation, and new technology. Yamaji: "Japanese companies are quite receptive for new development of technologies like AI... already adopters of new technologies."

[[Warren Buffett]]'s [[Buffett Japan sogo shosha trade|$24B gain on Japan's five trading houses]] — [[Mitsubishi Corp]], [[Mitsui & Co]], [[Itochu]], [[Marubeni]], [[Sumitomo Corp]] — served as a global signal. He funded the purchases by issuing yen-denominated bonds (borrowing cheap yen to buy yen assets — a free carry trade), and his 2023 Tokyo visit turbo-charged institutional interest. [[Apollo]]'s [[Marc Rowan]] calls it "generational change" across governance, rates, and government policy.

### Private capital gap

Japan's financial system is primarily two products: bank debt and equity. The corporate bond market is only ¥60T outstanding — small for the world's fourth-largest economy. As capital needs grow (manufacturing, energy, AI, infrastructure — measured in "trillions," per Rowan), firms like [[Apollo]] see opportunity to provide long-dated, investment-grade private credit that banks can't efficiently supply. Not replacing banks, but supplementing them. See [[Private Credit]].

## Political catalyst — the Takaichi era

PM [[Sanae Takaichi]] won a landslide in the Feb 8, 2026 snap election — the best performance in LDP's 70-year history. First female PM. Achieved supermajority alone, without the [[Komeito]] coalition that sustained LDP for 26 years. [[Mireya Solís]] ([[Brookings Institution]]): "a thunderbolt election."

Her "growth-first" agenda includes:
- 7% productivity credit for high-tech manufacturing investment
- Up to 50% R&D credit for AI and green energy ("Strategic Technology")
- Expanded [[NISA]] accounts (now includes minors)
- 2-year consumption tax holiday on food (bond markets nervous)
- AI/robotics integrated into national security framework
- Defense industry as priority industrial policy sector — [[Japan]] as defense exporter is new
- Record budget (one of the largest in history)

Markets responded with the "Takaichi Trade" — Nikkei +5% in days, outperforming S&P 500.

**Fiscal risk**: 240% debt/GDP + expansionary fiscal policy + potential tax cuts = bond market tension. Solís: "the voters have given her a very overwhelming mandate, but the markets have not." How she navigates fiscal ambition vs bond market discipline is the key story. See [[Abenomics]] for the comparison with Abe's more restrained fiscal approach.

## Demographics — the structural headwind

Working-age population (15-64) peaked in 1990. Japan loses ~500K people per year. Responses:
- **Womenomics**: female labor participation now among OECD highest (Abe-era policy)
- **Elderly workforce**: seniors remain active, high participation rates
- **Immigration**: gradually loosening but culturally constrained
- **Automation/AI**: massive corporate investment in productivity — [[Fanuc]], [[Tokyo Electron]], robotics

As [[Hiromi Yamaji]] notes: "There is a ceiling" for female and senior workforce additions. Automation and AI investment are now the primary productivity lever.

### Culture shift

The salaryman stereotype is outdated. Since ~2015-2016, roughly 1 in 3 new graduates plan to leave their first company. Joining startups has become one of the most popular career choices for university students — replacing the traditional prestige jobs (bureaucrats, consultants, investment banks). [[Mireya Solís]]: 38-40% of all Japanese employees are now "non-regular workers," and lateral career moves are increasingly common.

## Evolution

- **1980s**: Industrial powerhouse — auto, electronics, steel. Asset bubble fueled by patient capital and speculative real estate (Tokyo land = California's value)
- **1989**: Nikkei peaks at 38,957. P/E exceeds 60x
- **1990-2010**: Bubble bursts. Government and banks fail to act aggressively → zombie banks, balance sheet recession. Two decades of near-zero growth and deflation
- **2012**: [[Shinzo Abe]] launches "Abenomics" — monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, structural reform. BOJ begins massive QE under Kuroda
- **2015**: Abe calls for corporate governance reform. Stewardship Code + Corporate Governance Code adopted
- **2020**: [[Warren Buffett]] discloses stakes in five trading houses — global signal
- **2022**: Yen collapses to 150/$ as BOJ holds rates while Fed hikes. Cost-push inflation finally breaks deflation
- **2023**: [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] demands companies below book value publish improvement plans
- **2024 Feb**: Nikkei breaks 1989 ATH (39,098). Aug 5: -12.4% crash (yen carry trade unwind), recovers
- **2024 Mar**: BOJ first rate hike in 17 years (end of negative rates)
- **2025**: Nikkei surges past 50,000. US-Japan trade deal lowers tariffs. Corporate reform deepens
- **2025**: Record carve-out/spin-off activity — 280 in H1 alone, ¥35T deal volume. Delistings surge to 125 (from ~50 historically). Corporate Japan restructuring portfolios
- **2026 Feb**: Takaichi landslide (LDP supermajority, first time without [[Komeito]] in 26 years). Nikkei hits 58,000. Buffett's Japan bet worth $24B gain. [[Apollo]] convenes 200 partners in Tokyo

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Reflation breaks 30-year deflationary cycle → nominal GDP growth returns
- Corporate governance revolution: buybacks, unwinding cross-shareholdings, ROE improvement
- Political stability (Takaichi supermajority) → multi-year policy continuity
- "Japan instead of China" trade — institutional capital rotating from China
- P/E 16.2x — fundamentally supported, not speculative (vs 60x in 1989)
- Megabanks ([[MUFG]], [[SMFG]], [[Mizuho]]) benefit from rate normalization (highest NIM in 30 years)

**Bear:**
- Demographics: shrinking/aging population is structural, not cyclical
- 240% debt/GDP — highest among developed nations. Rate normalization raises debt service costs
- Yen weakness (156-158/$) erodes USD returns for foreign investors
- Global slowdown risk — export-dependent economy vulnerable to US/China deceleration
- Q2-Q3 2025 GDP contraction suggests recovery is fragile
- Wage growth may stall, undermining BOJ's 2% target and reflation thesis
