# Japan

The world's fourth-largest economy ($4.2T GDP, 2024), emerging from three "lost decades" of deflation and stagnation into a reflationary regime. [[Nikkei 225]] hit 58,000 in Feb 2026 — a 49% gain from its Feb 2024 breakout above the 1989 bubble high. The structural story: returning inflation, [[BOJ]] rate normalization, corporate governance revolution, and political stability under PM [[Sanae Takaichi]].

## Why now — the lost decades exit

Three decades of deflation ended when external shocks (Covid supply chains, Ukraine energy crisis) forced Japanese corporates to pass costs to consumers for the first time. CPI went from zero/negative to ~3%. This broke the deflationary psychology: cash went from king to worst asset. The [[BOJ]] under Governor [[Kazuo Ueda]] began normalizing rates — first hike in 17 years (Mar 2024), policy rate now 0.75% with [[Vanguard]] projecting 1.25% by end-2026.

Simultaneously, the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] under CEO [[Hiromi Yamaji]] implemented aggressive governance reforms starting 2023: demanding companies trading below book value explain why, pushing cross-shareholding unwinding, mandating independent directors. Result: record buybacks (¥35T in 2025), rising ROE, and more than half of listed companies now above book value. See [[Japan corporate governance revolution]].

[[Warren Buffett]]'s $24B gain on Japanese trading houses (disclosed 2020, accumulated from 2019) served as a global signal. [[Apollo]]'s [[Mark Rowan]] calls it "generational change" across governance, rates, and government policy.

## Political catalyst — the Takaichi era

PM [[Sanae Takaichi]] won a landslide in the Feb 8, 2026 snap election (LDP + [[Japan Innovation Party]] supermajority). Her "growth-first" agenda includes:
- 7% productivity credit for high-tech manufacturing investment
- Up to 50% R&D credit for AI and green energy ("Strategic Technology")
- Expanded [[NISA]] accounts (now includes minors)
- 2-year consumption tax holiday on food
- AI/robotics integrated into national security framework

Markets responded with the "Takaichi Trade" — Nikkei +5% in days, outperforming S&P 500.

## Demographics — the structural headwind

Working-age population (15-64) peaked in 1990. Japan loses ~500K people per year. Responses:
- **Womenomics**: female labor participation now among OECD highest (Abe-era policy)
- **Elderly workforce**: seniors remain active, high participation rates
- **Immigration**: gradually loosening but culturally constrained
- **Automation/AI**: massive corporate investment in productivity — [[Fanuc]], [[Tokyo Electron]], robotics

As [[Hiromi Yamaji]] notes: "There is a ceiling" for female and senior workforce additions. Automation and AI investment are now the primary productivity lever.

## Evolution

- **1980s**: Industrial powerhouse — auto, electronics, steel. Asset bubble fueled by patient capital and speculative real estate (Tokyo land = California's value)
- **1989**: Nikkei peaks at 38,957. P/E exceeds 60x
- **1990-2010**: Bubble bursts. Government and banks fail to act aggressively → zombie banks, balance sheet recession. Two decades of near-zero growth and deflation
- **2012**: [[Shinzo Abe]] launches "Abenomics" — monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, structural reform. BOJ begins massive QE under Kuroda
- **2015**: Abe calls for corporate governance reform. Stewardship Code + Corporate Governance Code adopted
- **2020**: [[Warren Buffett]] discloses stakes in five trading houses — global signal
- **2022**: Yen collapses to 150/$ as BOJ holds rates while Fed hikes. Cost-push inflation finally breaks deflation
- **2023**: [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] demands companies below book value publish improvement plans
- **2024 Feb**: Nikkei breaks 1989 ATH (39,098). Aug 5: -12.4% crash (yen carry trade unwind), recovers
- **2024 Mar**: BOJ first rate hike in 17 years (end of negative rates)
- **2025**: Nikkei surges past 50,000. US-Japan trade deal lowers tariffs. Corporate reform deepens
- **2026 Feb**: Takaichi landslide. Nikkei hits 58,000. Buffett's Japan bet worth $24B gain

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Reflation breaks 30-year deflationary cycle → nominal GDP growth returns
- Corporate governance revolution: buybacks, unwinding cross-shareholdings, ROE improvement
- Political stability (Takaichi supermajority) → multi-year policy continuity
- "Japan instead of China" trade — institutional capital rotating from China
- P/E 16.2x — fundamentally supported, not speculative (vs 60x in 1989)
- Megabanks ([[MUFG]], [[SMFG]], [[Mizuho]]) benefit from rate normalization (highest NIM in 30 years)

**Bear:**
- Demographics: shrinking/aging population is structural, not cyclical
- 240% debt/GDP — highest among developed nations. Rate normalization raises debt service costs
- Yen weakness (156-158/$) erodes USD returns for foreign investors
- Global slowdown risk — export-dependent economy vulnerable to US/China deceleration
- Q2-Q3 2025 GDP contraction suggests recovery is fragile
- Wage growth may stall, undermining BOJ's 2% target and reflation thesis
