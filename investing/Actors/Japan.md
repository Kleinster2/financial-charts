Japan — World's 4th largest economy. Key US ally in Indo-Pacific. Remilitarizing amid [[China]] tensions.

---

## Why Japan matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$4.2T (#4 globally) |
| [[Defense]] budget | 9T yen ($57.4B) in 2026, +3.8% YoY |
| US alliance | Treaty ally since 1951 |
| Key tension | [[China]] (Taiwan, Senkaku/Diaoyu) |

## Key indices

| Index | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Nikkei 225 | Blue chips |
| TOPIX | Broad market |
| JPX-Nikkei 400 | Governance focus |

## Government

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PM | Sanae Takaichi | Conservative, hawkish on [[China]] |
| Finance Minister | [[Satsuki Katayama]] | Called for market calm during Jan 2026 bond rout |
| Party | LDP | Dominant since 1955 |

Snap election Feb 8, 2026: Takaichi called early election, promised 2-year food tax suspension. Main opposition (Centrist Reform Alliance) pledged permanent abolition — fiscal discipline concerns across political spectrum.

Takaichi stance: Said Taiwan "contingency" could threaten Japan's security and necessitate military response. Triggered major [[China]] retaliation (Jan 2026).

## [[China]] relations

See [[China-Japan relations]] for full analysis.

Current status (Jan 2026): Major escalation.

| [[China]] action | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Export ban | Dual-use equipment, rare earths, semiconductors |
| Anti-dumping probe | Dichlorosilane (chip manufacturing) |
| Soft pressure | Canceled business delegation, travel restrictions |

Trigger: Takaichi's Taiwan comments. [[China]] views as interference; wants her out.

---

## Rare earth independence

See [[Japan Chikyu rare earth mission 2026-01]].

The problem: Japan 60% dependent on [[China]] for rare earths (down from 90% in 2010). Almost 100% dependent for heavy REEs like [[Dysprosium]].

The solution: Minamitori Island deep-sea mining project.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | 40B yen ($250M) since 2018 |
| Current phase | Test mission (Jan-Feb 2026) |
| Next phase | Full mining trial (Feb 2027) |
| Depth | ~6 km (world first) |

Diversification to date:
- Sojitz/Lynas partnership (Australian rare earths)
- Recycling programs
- Manufacturing processes using less REE

---

## [[Defense]] posture

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Defense]] budget | Record 9T yen, doubling by 2027 target |
| Counterstrike capability | Acquiring long-range missiles |
| US bases | Okinawa, Yokosuka, Misawa, others |
| [[AUKUS]] coordination | Observer status discussions |

Shift: Post-WWII pacifism eroding. Constitutional reinterpretation allows collective self-defense (2014).

## Semiconductor strategy

See [[Japan Semiconductor Revival]].

### FY2026 budget (Jan 2026)

Japan quadrupling AI/semiconductor spending:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 budget | ¥1.23T ($7.9B) |
| vs previous | ~4x increase |
| Rapidus allocation | ¥150B (total now ¥250B) |
| Focus | Advanced semiconductors, AI |

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's cabinet approved the draft budget. Parliamentary deliberations ongoing.

### Key initiatives

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Rapidus]] | 2nm fab with [[IBM]], IMEC — mass production target 2027, ¥250B govt investment |
| [[TSMC]] Japan | Kumamoto fab operational, 60% local procurement |
| Equipment | [[Tokyo Electron]], Screen Holdings |
| Materials | JSR, [[Shin-Etsu]] dominant |
| Strategy pivot | [[Advanced packaging]] (vs competing with [[TSMC]] on lithography)

### [[China]] anti-dumping probe (Jan 7, 2026)

[[China]] investigating Japanese dichlorosilane imports — key semiconductor manufacturing chemical. Japan controls 72% of [[China]]'s domestic supply (2022-2024 average). Probe covers Jul 2024 - Jun 2025.

Strategic significance: Potential retaliation tool in tech war. Japan's three leading producers (Tokuyama, Mitsubishi Chemical, [[Shin-Etsu]]) dominate global supply. If [[China]] imposes duties, must find alternatives or develop domestic capacity.

## Nuclear restart

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 restart (Jan 2026): TEPCO restarted first reactor at world's largest nuclear complex (7 units, 8.2 GW total capacity). First TEPCO nuclear operation since Fukushima (2011).

Significance:
- Before 2011, nuclear = ~30% of Japan's electricity
- Currently nuclear = ~7% (only 12 of 33 operable reactors running)
- Energy security critical for semiconductor manufacturing (power-intensive)
- Reduces [[LNG]] import dependence

Remaining capacity: If all operable reactors restart, Japan could recover ~20% of electricity from nuclear. Political and safety hurdles remain significant.

## Bond market crisis (Jan 2026)

[[JGB crash January 2026]]: $280 million of trading triggered a $41 billion wipeout across the JGB curve on January 21. Ultra-long yields hit record highs. [[Scott Bessent]] called it a "six-standard-deviation move."

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 30Y yield (post-crash) | ~3.66% (record) |
| 40Y yield (post-crash) | >4% — first JGB maturity above 4% in 30+ years |
| Trigger volume | $280M (30Y + 40Y combined) |
| Market cap loss | $41B |
| Dislocation index | All-time high |

### Why it happened

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| BOJ holdings | 50%+ of JGBs — supply absorbed, market illiquid |
| Foreign dominance | 65% of monthly cash transactions (up from 12% in 2009) |
| Life insurer retreat | Traditional long-end buyers stepped back |
| Fiscal concerns | PM Takaichi's sales tax pause on food (¥5T/year) |
| Nov stimulus | ¥21.3T ($137B) package — biggest since pandemic |
| Inflation normalization | Decades of deflation ending |

### Life insurer impact

Big 4 life insurers reported $60B combined unrealized losses on domestic bond holdings — 4x prior year. Higher yields mean huge paper losses on accumulated portfolios.

### Contagion risk

Citi estimates JGB turmoil risks up to $130B Treasury selling as Japanese institutions repatriate capital. Rising JGB yields → domestic bonds attractive → sell foreign bonds → UST pressure.

## US-Japan $36B energy/critical minerals deal (Feb 17-18, 2026)

First tranche of Japan's $550B total investment commitment under the Trump trade deal. Three projects:

| Project | Value | Operator | Location | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| Natural gas power plant | $33B | SB Energy ([[SoftBank]]) | Portsmouth, Ohio | 9.2 GW — "largest natural gas generation facility in history" |
| Deepwater crude oil export terminal | $2.1B | Sentinel Midstream | Texas (GulfLink) | Could generate ~$30B/year in US crude exports at full capacity |
| Synthetic diamond manufacturing | $600M | [[Element Six]] ([[De Beers]]) | Georgia | Industrial diamonds for advanced manufacturing |

Context:
- Part of $550B total pledge — in exchange, Trump lowered tariffs on Japanese exports (especially automotive)
- PM [[Sanae Takaichi|Takaichi]]: projects designed to build resilient supply chains in areas crucial for economic security
- Financed via [[JBIC]] and NEXI (government-backed), not direct corporate investment — only 1-2% is cash, rest is loans/guarantees
- Japan has 45 business days to fund after selection; failure could trigger tariff reimposition
- Next milestone: Takaichi-Trump meeting in Washington, Mar 19

Investment implications:
- SoftBank's SB Energy now a major US power player — 9.2 GW plant would be among the largest in the US
- Synthetic diamond facility signals Japan-US critical minerals cooperation beyond rare earths
- Crude export terminal deepens US-Japan energy security ties

## Investment relevance

Themes:
- [[Defense]] spending increase → MHI, Kawasaki Heavy
- Semiconductor revival → [[Tokyo Electron]], equipment suppliers
- Yen weakness → exporters benefit
- [[China]] decoupling risk → supply chain disruption

Risks:
- [[China]] retaliation (rare earths, tourism, trade)
- Demographic decline
- Government debt (~260% of GDP)
- [[JGB]] market fragility — [[JGB crash January 2026]] showed $280M can move market $41B
