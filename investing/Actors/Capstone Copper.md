## Mantoverde expansion (MVDP)

| Metric | Detail |

| Cost | $870M |
| First concentrate | June 2024 |
| Commercial production | September 2024 |
| Full milling rates | End 2024 |
| Record month | 10,747t Cu (Dec 2025) |

**MV Optimized** (sanctioned Q3 2025): Increases concentrator throughput from 32,000 to 45,000 tpd. Adds ~20kt Cu and ~6k oz gold per annum. Extends mine life from 19 to 25 years. Capital cost: $176M. Tie-in Q3 2026, ramp Q4 2026, sustained 45ktpd from early 2027.

**Labour strike:** Union #2 (22% of workforce) struck Jan 2, 2026. Operations at 50–75% of normal levels during strike.

## Santo Domingo

| Metric | Detail |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 4 consecutive years of record production
- MVDP ramp = significant margin expansion
- MV Optimized adds 20kt Cu cheaply ($176M)
- Santo Domingo is a high-return brownfield-adjacent project
- Americas-focused = lower geopolitical risk
- District integration → 200kt+ from MV-SD combined
- Cobalt by-product optionality
- Clean balance sheet (1.0x leverage)

**Bear:**
- Santo Domingo requires $2.3B capex — large for Capstone's size
- Mantoverde labour strike risk (ongoing)
- [[Chile]] permitting and regulatory uncertainty
- Pinto Valley aging (Arizona)
- Santo Domingo FID not yet made
- Premium valuation (~75x P/E)
