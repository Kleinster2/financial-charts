## Investment focus

| Area | Examples |
|------|----------|
| AI infrastructure | Data centers, connectivity |
| [[Semiconductors]] | Logic, memory, design, manufacturing (e.g. [[Altera]] via [[Silver Lake]]) |
| AI core tech | Models, software, data |
| Life sciences | AI applications |

Explicitly avoids: AI consumer apps, neo-clouds, robotics, quantum computing, energy providers. Strategy: invest across the "entire stack" — chips → data centers → models — to see demand signals across layers.

## OpenAI $50B round (Jan 2026)

**[[Sam Altman]] touring Middle East** to raise $50B+ at $750-830B valuation.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] raise | **$50B+** |
| Valuation | $750-830B |

MGX is among the investors Altman is meeting. This follows their participation in OpenAI's $6.6B round (Oct 2024).

**Context:** OpenAI CFO Sarah Frier published blog arguing revenue tracks compute 1:1 — implying more capital = more revenue. Revenue grew 10x from 2023-2025 alongside 9.5x compute growth.

## Spending cadence & strategy (Feb 17, 2026)

Bloomberg deep-dive based on first in-depth interview with Ali Osman and David Scott (Davos, WEF):

- Plans to deploy up to $10B/year on select companies over the next few years
- Portfolio of ~20 firms as of Feb 2026
- Osman forecasts generative AI will grow to a $700B market within 5 years — above most mainstream estimates
- Entered [[Anthropic]] at $17B valuation; now worth $380B post-money (Series G, Feb 2026)
- [[Databricks]] has doubled to $134B valuation since MGX first invested (2024)
- Assembling a $30B consortium for AI infrastructure funding
- Structured like a VC/buyout firm: partners receive carried interest, external investors seek returns — unlike typical sovereign funds
- Compares itself to [[NVIDIA]] (invests across AI stack, not a traditional PE/VC model)
- Minimum check size reportedly $500M+ (per entrepreneur anecdote; Osman denies formal threshold)

On AI lab index strategy (backing [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[xAI]] simultaneously): Osman sees them serving different markets — OpenAI in consumer, Anthropic in enterprise, xAI in robotics. "The TAM is so significant that the next net dollar gained is not at the expense of someone else."

Scott on risk: "We're not in places where there's a lot of speculation" — avoids neo-clouds, unknown developers, unzoned data center sites.
