CEO Jim Conroy (since Feb 2025, formerly RH). Tariff exposure: >50% of merchandise from [[China]]. Withdrew FY25 guidance due to macro uncertainty. Value retail structural winner but facing near-term tariff headwinds.

## Store banners

| Banner | Stores | Positioning | Savings |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Ross Dress for Less** | 1,873 | Off-price apparel/home | 20-60% off retail |

## Off-price competitive landscape

| Company | Revenue | Stores | Market cap |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| **[[TJX]]** | $56B | 5,000+ | ~$130B |
| **Ross Stores** | $21B | 2,233 | ~$49B |
| **[[Burlington]]** | $10.6B | 1,211 | ~$20B |

Ross is solidly #2 but less than half TJX's scale. Burlington is the fastest-growing but smallest.

## Tariff risk

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| [[China]] exposure | >50% of merchandise from [[China]] |
| Impact | $0.22-$0.25/share headwind in FY25 |
| Response | Withdrew annual guidance |
| CEO comment | "Heightened volatility in macroeconomic and geopolitical environments" |

Tariff escalation is the key near-term risk for Ross. More [[China]]-dependent than TJX.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Off-price structural tailwind (value-seeking consumers)
- #2 position with room to grow (TJX has 5,000+ stores vs Ross 2,233)
- dd's DISCOUNTS addresses lower-income demographic
- Consistent EPS growth
- New CEO Jim Conroy (former RH) brings fresh perspective

**Bear:**
- Tariff exposure (>50% [[China]]) — FY25 guidance withdrawn
- Traffic softening (January-February weakness noted)
- Less scale than TJX (weaker buying power)
- dd's DISCOUNTS lower-margin
- Valuation not cheap (~22x forward PE)
