## Business model

**Asset-light franchise model:** Marriott owns few hotels — revenue comes from:
1. **Franchise fees** — % of room revenue
2. **Management fees** — % of gross revenue + incentive fees
3. **Loyalty program** — Marriott Bonvoy (200M+ members)

| Revenue source | % of total |
|---------------|------------|
| Franchise/license fees | ~60% |
| Management fees | ~25% |
| Other (owned, timeshare) | ~15% |

**Capital allocation:** ~$4B returned to shareholders in 2025 via dividends ($0.67/share quarterly) and buybacks.

## Growth strategy

| Focus | 2025-2026 targets |
|-------|-------------------|
| Net rooms growth | 4-5% annually |
| RevPAR growth | 1.5-2.5% (2026) |
| India expansion | 150+ hotels planned |
| Tech investment | $1B+ (new PMS, reservations, loyalty systems) |

**Q3 2025:** Added 17,900 net rooms (13,900 international). Development pipeline remains strong.

## Failed Sonder partnership

**Aug 2024:** Marriott announced a licensing agreement with [[Sonder]], a tech-enabled short-term rental company. Thousands of Sonder units would join Marriott's distribution and Bonvoy loyalty program.

**Nov 2025:** Marriott terminated the agreement after integration challenges. One day later, Sonder filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

The deal illustrated risks of partnerships with cash-burning startups — even Marriott's distribution power couldn't save a fundamentally unprofitable model.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Largest global footprint = network effects
- Asset-light = capital-efficient, high ROIC
- Marriott Bonvoy loyalty moat (200M+ members)
- India/international expansion runway
- Share buybacks support EPS growth

**Bear:**
- 2025 RevPAR growth near zero (CBRE: 0.1%)
- Canadian inbound travel down 24% (tariff tensions)
- Economy segment underperforming (-1.8% RevPAR)
- Hilton executing better (stock +175% vs MAR +115% since 2020)
- Tech modernization spending ($1B) pressures near-term margins
