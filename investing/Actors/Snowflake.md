## Why Snowflake matters

Major data infrastructure, margin inflection underway:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | SNOW |
| Market cap | ~$58B |
| Growth | 30% product revenue Y/Y (Q4 FY26) |
| Operating margin | ~7% non-GAAP (Q4 FY26) |
| RPO | $9.77B (+42% Y/Y) |

---

## Business model

Data Cloud:
- Cloud data warehouse
- Consumption-based pricing
- Multi-cloud ([[AWS]], Azure, GCP)
- Data sharing/marketplace

Revenue: storage + compute consumption.

## Financial reality

Margin inflection — the story has changed:

| Metric | Q4 FY26 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Product revenue growth | 30% Y/Y | Stable (was 29% in Q3) |
| Non-GAAP operating margin | ~7% | Was negative through FY25 |
| FCF margin | ~50-60% (Q4, seasonal) | Turned positive FY26 |
| RPO (backlog) | $9.77B (+42% Y/Y) | Accelerating |
| Net revenue retention | 125% | Stable |

No longer burning cash. FY27 guide: 12.5% non-GAAP operating margin (up from ~9% FY26). Profitability gap with [[Palantir]] still wide, but trajectory reversed.

## Palantir partnership

Announced Oct 2025:
- Integration with Palantir Foundry/AIP
- Bidirectional zero-copy data access
- Joint enterprise customers
- Snowflake = data layer, Palantir = AI layer

Customer example: [[Eaton]] using both platforms.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Approach | Snowflake vs |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| [[Databricks]] | Lakehouse (unified) | Warehouse focus |
| [[Palantir]] | AI applications | Partner now |
| BigQuery (Google) | Cloud-native | Multi-cloud |
| Redshift (AWS) | AWS-native | Multi-cloud |

---

## AI strategy

Cortex AI + Snowflake Intelligence:
- Cortex AI: LLM functions, vector search, ML features in-platform
- Snowflake Intelligence: agentic AI product (GA Nov 2025), 2,500+ customers in first ~3 months
- AI feature accounts: 9,100 (up from 7,300 in Q3 FY26)
- AI revenue run rate exceeded $100M — a quarter ahead of internal projections
- Still playing catch-up to [[Databricks]], which has 14x more AI revenue ($1.4B vs ~$100M)

---

## Stock performance

IPO darling, long drawdown, incomplete recovery:
- IPO Sept 2020 at $120
- Peaked ~$400 (2021)
- Now ~$155-170 range (~$58B market cap)
- Q4 FY26 earnings: initially +6% AH, reversed to -2.5% on growth deceleration concerns (30% to 27% guided)

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Data infrastructure essential, sticky consumption model
- $9.77B RPO (+42% Y/Y) provides multi-year visibility
- Margin inflection: -27% to +7% non-GAAP, guided 12.5% FY27
- [[Palantir]] partnership opens AI application layer
- Snowflake Intelligence adoption (2,500+ in 3 months) validates AI strategy
- [[Observe]] acquisition ($1B) enters $50B IT ops market

Bear:
- [[Databricks]] growing 2x faster at similar scale, 14x more AI revenue
- Growth decelerating: 30% to 27% guided — market punished immediately
- Cloud providers ([[Amazon]] Redshift, [[Google]] BigQuery) competing natively
- Consumption model = revenue volatility in downturns
- $58B valuation still ~12x forward revenue for 27% grower

## Q4 FY2026 earnings (Feb 25, 2026)

### Results

| Metric | Q4 FY26 | Y/Y | vs Est |

| Total revenue | $1.28B | +28-30% | Beat |

Largest deal in company history: $400M+. Snowflake Intelligence (agentic AI, GA Nov 2025) reached 2,500+ customers.

### FY2027 guidance

| Metric | Guide | vs Street |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Product revenue | $5.66B (~27% growth) | Above $5.50B est. |
| Non-GAAP op margin | 12.5% | Up from ~9% FY26 |

The 27% growth guide is where the market flinched — deceleration from 30%. Stock initially +6% AH, reversed to -2.5%.

### [[Observe]] acquisition

$1B all-cash acquisition of [[Observe]] — AI-powered IT observability platform. Largest acquisition in Snowflake history (surpassing $800M Streamlit, 2022). Targets the $50B+ IT operations market. Integrates observability data directly into the Snowflake data platform.

### [[Databricks]] comparison

At similar ~$5B revenue scale, the divergence is stark:
- [[Databricks]] growing ~2x faster (~60% vs 30%)
- [[Databricks]] AI revenue: $1.4B vs Snowflake's ~$100M (14x gap)
- Both consumption-based, but [[Databricks]] has deeper AI/ML native integration
- Snowflake's edge: broader enterprise data warehouse installed base, multi-cloud neutrality
