## Significance

Founders Fund is the financial engine of the Thiel network — the same orbit that produced [[Palantir]], [[Anduril]], the [[Hill and Valley Forum]], and multiple Trump administration appointees. Its portfolio companies are increasingly the default technology partners of the US government.

The firm's investment thesis is explicitly anti-incrementalist: back transformative companies that most VCs consider too weird, too defense-adjacent, or too politically risky. This thesis has become mainstream as defense tech and AI infrastructure have converged.
