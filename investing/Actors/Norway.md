## Wealth tax and capital flight (2022–present)

Norway is one of the few OECD countries that still levies an annual [[Wealth tax]] on net assets — a system dating back to 1892. In 2022, the [[Jonas Gahr Støre|Støre]] government raised the top rate from 0.85% to 1.1% on net wealth above NOK 20M (~$2M), expecting to raise an additional $146M per year.

The result was the opposite. The tax hike triggered an unprecedented exodus of wealthy residents:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Expected additional revenue | $146M/year |
| Actual net revenue impact | -$448M/year |
| Wealth that left the country | ~$54B (NOK 600B+) |
| Tax revenue lost from departures | $594M/year |
| Wealthy residents who left (2022) | 261 (assets >NOK 10M) |
| Wealthy residents who left (2023) | 254 |
| Total vs prior rate | 2x+ the historical annual average |

More than 30 billionaires and multimillionaires left in 2022 alone — more than the total who left during the previous 13 years combined (Dagens Næringsliv). By 2024, ~300 multimillionaires and billionaires had relocated, with 105 of Norway's 400 richest now living abroad or having transferred wealth to relatives who do (Kapital magazine).

### Notable departures

- [[Kjell Inge Røkke]] — Norway's then-richest person, chairman of [[Aker ASA]], moved to Lugano, Switzerland in 2022. Wrote an open letter to Aker's board explaining his "difficult choice." Reportedly faced NOK 175M (~$17M) annual wealth tax despite modest salary.
- Many others moved to Switzerland (Lucerne, Lugano, Zurich), with some choosing London.

### Policy response

- Exit tax: 37.8% on unrealised capital gains above NOK 3M, triggered upon leaving Norway
- 2024 loophole closure: Eliminated indefinite deferral of exit tax payments for emigrants
- September 2025 election: Labour returned to power; wealth tax was a defining campaign issue
- Norway's tax administration publicly lists all tax returns (radical transparency), and the Socialist Left party maintains a "wall of shame" of departed wealthy residents

### The counterargument

Despite the exodus, supporters argue the wealth tax works as intended. Revenue from the wealth tax has climbed overall (reaching 0.6% of GDP) because 671,639 people (~12% of the population) pay it — not just billionaires. The departures represent a concentrated but small fraction of total revenue. Norway abolished inheritance tax in 2014, making the wealth tax the primary backstop for progressive taxation.

Reuters (Nov 2025) framed the lesson as: "a wealth tax will scare off some millionaires, but if set broadly enough, revenues can still be worth it."

## Economy and fiscal model

Norway funnels all oil and gas revenues into the [[Government Pension Fund Global]] and caps annual government withdrawals at 3% of the fund's value (the "fiscal rule"). This forces reliance on non-oil tax revenue, making wealth tax politically significant.
