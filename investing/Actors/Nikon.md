## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Tokyo, Japan |
| Precision Equipment revenue | ¥219B (~$1.5B, FY 2024) |
| DUV market share | ~5% |
| EUV position | **None** (lost race) |
| Ticker | 7731 (Tokyo) |

## How Nikon lost

**Was the lithography leader in the 1990s.** Lost to ASML due to:

| Factor | What happened |
|--------|---------------|
| Technology bet | Chose 157nm wavelength path (dead end) |
| EUV timing | Underinvested in EUV R&D |
| Customer co-development | ASML got Intel, TSMC, Samsung funding |
| Scale | ASML consolidated market during transition |

By time Nikon recognized EUV importance, ASML had insurmountable lead.

---

## Current position

| Segment | Nikon | ASML |
|---------|-------|------|
| EUV | 0% | 100% |
| DUV (advanced) | ~5% | ~90% |
| FPD lithography | Competitive | Competitive |

Nikon survives in cost-sensitive DUV segment and flat panel displays.

## DUV product line

**ArF Scanners (193nm):**

| Model | Type | Overlay | Throughput |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| **NSR-S333F** | ArF (latest) | Best-in-class | High |
| **NSR-S322F** | ArF Dry | ≤2nm | 250 wph |

**KrF Scanners (248nm):**

| Model | Resolution | Throughput |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **NSR-S220D** | 110nm | 250 wph |

## Value proposition

| Factor | Nikon advantage |
|--------|-----------------|
| Cost | Lower than ASML DUV |
| Service | Strong in Asia |
| Mature nodes | 28nm-7nm specialty |
| Hybrid capability | Scan + step-and-repeat |

Targets fabs that don't need leading edge: automotive, industrial, IoT, power.

---

## Geographic strength

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Japan | Home market |
| Southeast Asia | 25 installations (2023) |
| China | Growing (DUV allowed) |
| Taiwan/Korea | Limited (ASML dominant) |

China reliance on DUV benefits Nikon as alternative to ASML.

---

## FPD lithography

Flat panel display lithography remains competitive:

| Application | Nikon position |
|-------------|----------------|
| LCD panels | Strong |
| OLED displays | Growing |
| Large-format | Competitive |

Less dependent on ASML in this segment.

---

## Financial trend

| Year | Precision Equipment | Trend |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| FY 2023 | ¥203B | — |
| FY 2024 | ¥219B | +8% |

Modest growth from cost-sensitive markets, but far below ASML's trajectory.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stable niche in mature nodes
- China market opportunity (DUV allowed)
- Cost advantage over ASML
- FPD lithography diversification

**Bear:**
- Lost EUV permanently
- ASML dominant even in DUV
- Mature node margins lower
- Technology leadership gone
