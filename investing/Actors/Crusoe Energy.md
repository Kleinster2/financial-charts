**Crusoe Energy** — AI cloud powered by stranded natural gas. Blue Owl $15B JV partner.

---

## Why Crusoe matters

Crusoe solves two problems at once — stranded gas monetization and AI compute:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Model | Capture flared natural gas → power AI data centers |
| Advantage | Cheap, stranded power source |
| Blue Owl JV | $15B for Abilene, Texas facility |
| Scale | 1.2 GW planned capacity |

---

## Business model

**The insight:**
- [[Oil]] wells flare (burn) natural gas that's uneconomical to pipe
- Crusoe puts generators + data centers at well sites
- Converts waste gas to AI compute
- Cheaper than grid power, reduces emissions

**Evolution:**
- Started with Bitcoin mining (2018)
- Pivoted to AI/ML workloads
- Now building hyperscale AI facilities

## Blue Owl partnership

**Abilene, Texas facility:**

| Phase | Size | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 (Oct 2024) | $3.4B | JV formed |
| Phase 2 (May 2025) | $15B total | Expansion |
| Capacity | 1.2 GW | "Largest GPU cluster" |

**Structure:**
- Blue Owl provides financing
- Crusoe develops and operates
- JPMorgan $2.3B construction financing

## Power advantage

| Source | Cost | Availability |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Grid power | $$$ | Constrained ([[Power constraints]]) |
| Stranded gas | $ | Abundant at oil fields |
| Nuclear | $$ | Long lead time |

Crusoe's power is cheap because it's otherwise wasted.

---

## AI pivot

**From Bitcoin to AI:**
- Bitcoin mining = proof of concept
- AI workloads = higher margin, more demand
- Same infrastructure, better economics
- Now targeting enterprise AI customers

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Power source | Differentiation |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| [[CoreWeave]] | Grid | GPU availability |
| AWS/Azure/GCP | Grid + PPA | Scale, ecosystem |
| **Crusoe** | Stranded gas | Cheap power |
| Lambda | Grid | Developer experience |

Crusoe wins on power cost; loses on location flexibility (tied to gas fields).
