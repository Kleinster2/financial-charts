**Vertiv** — Data center thermal management and power. Cooling = critical constraint for AI.

---

## Why Vertiv matters

AI chips generate massive heat — Vertiv provides the cooling:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #1 data center thermal/power |
| Products | Cooling, UPS, racks, monitoring |
| AI exposure | Liquid cooling for GPU clusters |
| Stock performance | +200%+ since 2023 |

---

## The cooling problem

**AI = heat:**
- H100 GPU: ~700W each
- B200 GPU: ~1000W+ each
- GPU clusters = megawatts of heat
- Traditional air cooling insufficient

**Vertiv's solution:**
- Liquid cooling systems
- Rear-door heat exchangers
- Direct-to-chip cooling
- Data center thermal management

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| **Thermal** | Precision cooling, liquid cooling, chillers |
| **Power** | UPS, switchgear, busway |
| **Racks** | IT racks, containment |
| **Monitoring** | DCIM software |

**Liquid cooling = growth driver:** AI forcing shift from air to liquid.

## AI data center requirements

| Metric | Traditional DC | AI DC |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Power density | 5-10 kW/rack | 50-100+ kW/rack |
| Cooling | Air | Liquid required |
| Infrastructure | Standard | Specialized |

Vertiv is positioned for the shift to high-density AI.
