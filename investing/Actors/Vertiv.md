Vertiv — Data center thermal management and power. Cooling = critical constraint for AI.

---

## Why Vertiv matters

AI chips generate massive heat — Vertiv provides the cooling:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#1 data center thermal/power |
| Stock performance | +1900%+ since Jan 2020 |
| Products | Cooling, [[UPS]], racks, monitoring |
| AI exposure | Liquid cooling for GPU clusters |
| Stock performance | +200%+ since 2023 |

---

## Price performance

![[vrt-price-chart.png]]
*VRT $8→$200 since early 2022 — the defining DC infrastructure trade. +1,300% in 3 years. Stock +10% on Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 11, 2026) — orders +252%, backlog $15B.*

## The cooling problem

AI = heat:
- H100 GPU: ~700W each
- B200 GPU: ~1000W+ each
- GPU clusters = megawatts of heat
- Traditional air cooling insufficient

Vertiv's solution:
- Liquid cooling systems
- Rear-door heat exchangers
- Direct-to-chip cooling
- Data center thermal management

## Product portfolio

![[dc-supplier-map-quartr.png]]
*Vertiv appears in 5 categories: LV distribution, UPS, server cabinets, HVAC, building automation. The DC infrastructure pure-play.*

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Thermal | Precision cooling, liquid cooling, chillers |
| Power | [[UPS]], switchgear, busway |
| Racks | IT racks, containment |
| Monitoring | DCIM software |

Liquid cooling = growth driver: AI forcing shift from air to liquid.

## AI data center requirements

| Metric | Traditional DC | AI DC |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Power density | 5-10 kW/rack | 50-100+ kW/rack |
| Cooling | Air | Liquid required |
| Infrastructure | Standard | Specialized |

Vertiv is positioned for the shift to high-density AI.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus | Vertiv advantage |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| [[Schneider Electric]] | Broad electrical | Thermal focus |
| [[Eaton]] | Power | DC specialization |
| Rittal | Racks, enclosures | Full stack |
| Asetek | Liquid cooling | Scale, relationships |

Vertiv is the pure-play DC infrastructure leader.
