## Price performance

![[vertiv-price-chart.png]]
*VRT +1900% since Jan 2020 — the defining DC infrastructure trade. Massively outperforms diversified peers [[Eaton|ETN]] (+400%) and [[nVent Electric|NVT]] (+250%). Pure-play on AI datacenter buildout.*

## The cooling problem

**AI = heat:**
- H100 GPU: ~700W each
- B200 GPU: ~1000W+ each
- GPU clusters = megawatts of heat
- Traditional air cooling insufficient

**Vertiv's solution:**
- Liquid cooling systems
- Rear-door heat exchangers
- Direct-to-chip cooling
- Data center thermal management

## Product portfolio

![[dc-supplier-map-quartr.png]]
*Vertiv appears in 5 categories: LV distribution, UPS, server cabinets, HVAC, building automation. The DC infrastructure pure-play.*

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| **Thermal** | Precision cooling, liquid cooling, chillers |
| **Power** | [[UPS]], switchgear, busway |
| **Racks** | IT racks, containment |
| **Monitoring** | DCIM software |

**Liquid cooling = growth driver:** AI forcing shift from air to liquid.

## AI data center requirements

| Metric | Traditional DC | AI DC |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Power density | 5-10 kW/rack | 50-100+ kW/rack |
| Cooling | Air | Liquid required |
| Infrastructure | Standard | Specialized |

Vertiv is positioned for the shift to high-density AI.
