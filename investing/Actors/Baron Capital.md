## Key funds

### Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | BPTRX |
| SpaceX allocation | ~29% |
| Expense ratio | 2.00% |
| SpaceX entry | 2017 (~4% position, ~$20B valuation) |

Primary vehicle for retail [[SpaceX]] exposure. SpaceX weighting ballooned from ~4% to ~29% as valuation grew from $20B to ~$800B. On Dec 4, 2025, an updated SpaceX valuation roughly doubled the position's mark — fund returned 19% in a single day.

Baron classifies SpaceX as "less-liquid" rather than illiquid, citing active secondary market trading and SpaceX's consistent share repurchasing. This skirts the [[SEC]] rule capping illiquid securities at 15% of a fund's portfolio.

### Baron Focused Growth Fund (BFGIX)

Also holds significant SpaceX exposure alongside BPTRX.

### ETF launches (Dec 2025)

| ETF | Ticker | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Baron First Principles | RONB | Core strategy (~21.5% SpaceX, ~5.4% [[xAI]]) |
| Baron Global Durable Advantage | BCGD | Global |
| Baron SMID Cap | BCSM | Small/mid cap |
| Baron Financials | BCFN | Financials |
| Baron Technology | BCTK | Technology |

## Financials

Private firm — no public financials. Revenue driven by management fees (typically 1-2% of AUM) and performance fees. At ~$45B AUM, estimated management fee revenue in the hundreds of millions annually. The Dec 2025 ETF launches expand retail distribution beyond existing mutual fund lineup.

---

## Investment philosophy

Core approach: find exceptional founder-led companies early, hold for decades, compound. Baron calls these "100-baggers." Ignores short-term volatility, does not trade around positions.

---

## Musk relationship

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tesla 2025 CEO Award | Publicly supported |
| SpaceX board | Active relationship |
| xAI | Series participant |

Deep conviction in [[Elon Musk]]'s long-term vision across [[Tesla]], [[SpaceX]], and [[xAI]]. ~65% of Ron Baron's personal wealth tied to Musk entities.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Exceptional track record ([[Tesla]] 30x)
- [[SpaceX]] IPO catalyst (reported Jun 2026, ~$1.5T valuation)
- Long-term compounding style
- New ETF lineup opens retail distribution

Bear:
- Musk concentration risk (~65% personal, large fund allocations)
- Ron Baron succession (age 82)
- Growth style underperforms in rate-elevated environments
- [[SpaceX]] valuation relies on "less-liquid" [[SEC]] classification — IPO may resolve, but also removes scarcity premium
