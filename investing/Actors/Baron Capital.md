| SpaceX + Tesla combined        | ~62% of net assets     |

Primary vehicle for retail [[SpaceX]] exposure. SpaceX weighting ballooned from ~4% (2017, ~$20B valuation) to ~32% as valuation grew to ~$800B. On Dec 4, 2025, an updated SpaceX valuation roughly doubled the position's mark — fund returned 19% in a single day.

Baron classifies SpaceX as "less-liquid" rather than illiquid under [[Rule 22e-4]], citing active secondary market trading and SpaceX's consistent share repurchasing. This skirts the [[SEC]]'s 15% cap on illiquid securities. The [[SEC]]'s 2022 proposed amendments would eliminate the "less liquid" category — if adopted, BPTRX would need to divest or seek exemptive relief.

## Financials

Private firm — no public financials. Revenue driven by management fees (typically 1-2% of AUM) and performance fees. At ~$45B AUM, estimated management fee revenue in the hundreds of millions annually. The Dec 2025 ETF launches expand retail distribution beyond existing mutual fund lineup.

## Fund price performance

![[bptrx-vs-bfgix-price-chart.png]]
*BPTRX and BFGIX both up ~450% since Jan 2020, driven by [[Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] appreciation. The Dec 4, 2025 SpaceX revaluation spike is visible in late 2025. BPTRX runs higher volatility due to greater SpaceX concentration (32% vs 19%). Both funds suffered ~43% drawdowns in 2022 when Tesla cratered.*

![[bptrx-price-chart.png]]
*BPTRX NAV from ~$30 (Mar 2020 low) to $251 (Feb 2026). The fund's 8x move is almost entirely attributable to Tesla and SpaceX — combined ~62% of assets.*

## Investment philosophy

Core approach: find exceptional founder-led companies early, hold for decades, compound. Baron calls these "100-baggers." Ignores short-term volatility, does not trade around positions.

---

## Musk relationship

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tesla 2025 CEO Award | Publicly supported |
| SpaceX board | Active relationship |
| xAI | Series participant |

Deep conviction in [[Elon Musk]]'s long-term vision across [[Tesla]], [[SpaceX]], and [[xAI]]. ~65% of Ron Baron's personal wealth tied to Musk entities.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Exceptional track record ([[Tesla]] 30x)
- [[SpaceX]] IPO catalyst (reported Jun 2026, ~$1.5T valuation)
- Long-term compounding style
- New ETF lineup opens retail distribution

Bear:
- Musk concentration risk (~65% personal, large fund allocations)
- Ron Baron succession (age 82)
- Growth style underperforms in rate-elevated environments
- [[SpaceX]] valuation relies on "less-liquid" [[SEC]] classification — IPO may resolve, but also removes scarcity premium
