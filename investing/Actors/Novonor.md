**Novonor** (formerly Odebrecht) — Brazilian conglomerate, once Latin America's largest construction and engineering firm. Rebranded in 2020 after the Lava Jato corruption scandal that brought down founder Marcelo Odebrecht and implicated executives across multiple countries. Holds the controlling stake in [[Braskem]], Brazil's largest petrochemicals company — the subject of a failed acquisition bid by [[Nelson Tanure]] in 2025.

## Context

Novonor's controlling stake in [[Braskem]] has been the subject of multiple sale attempts. [[Nelson Tanure]], backed by [[Rothschild & Co]], secured exclusivity to negotiate in H1 2025 with [[CADE]] pre-approval, but the deal collapsed when exclusivity expired in H2 2025 without agreement. The Braskem stake remains Novonor's most valuable remaining asset as the group continues post-Lava Jato restructuring.
