**ASM International** — Deposition equipment leader. ALD (atomic layer deposition) critical for GAA transistors. Dutch equipment champion alongside ASML.

---

## Why ASM International matters

ALD = essential for next-gen transistors:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ASM.AS (Amsterdam) |
| Market cap | ~€30B |
| ALD share | ~55% |
| Revenue | ~€2.5B |
| HQ | Almere, Netherlands |

## Key technology: ALD

**Atomic Layer Deposition:**
- Deposits films one atomic layer at a time
- Extreme precision and conformality
- Critical for FinFET and GAA transistors
- Enables 3nm/2nm process nodes

## Business segments

| Segment | Products |
|---------|----------|
| **ALD** | Atomic layer deposition |
| **Epitaxy** | Crystal growth |
| **PECVD** | Plasma-enhanced CVD |
| **Vertical furnaces** | Batch processing |

---

## GAA transistor opportunity

**Gate-All-Around transition:**
- GAA (RibbonFET) replacing FinFET at 2nm
- More ALD steps required
- ASM = leader in GAA-enabling ALD
- TSMC, Samsung, Intel all transitioning

| Node | ALD intensity |
|------|---------------|
| 7nm FinFET | Baseline |
| 3nm FinFET | 1.3x |
| 2nm GAA | 2x+ |
