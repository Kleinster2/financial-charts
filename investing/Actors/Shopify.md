## Shop Pay: Checkout weapon

[[Shop Pay]] is Shopify's accelerated checkout — and it's winning the [[Checkout wars]].

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | 200M+ (Q4 2024) |
| Q1 2025 GMV | $22B |
| YoY growth | +57% |
| Share of Shopify GMV | 38% (up from 33% in 2023) |
| Conversion lift | +36% for returning users |

Why it matters:
- Higher take rate than basic Shopify Payments
- Network effect: 200M users across 2M merchants
- Taking share from [[PayPal]] (which collapsed to 1% branded checkout growth)
- Creates merchant lock-in (leave Shopify, lose checkout network)

Shop Pay is powered by [[Stripe]] backend but branded Shopify — the customer relationship belongs to Shopify.
