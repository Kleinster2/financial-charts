**AMD** — fabless chip designer competing in CPUs (vs Intel) and GPUs/AI (vs NVIDIA).

## Core thesis

AMD has closed the hardware gap with NVIDIA but the [[CUDA moat]] kept them locked out of AI. The NodAI acquisition (late 2023) is their attempt to build software competence. Now has "non-zero chance" of challenging CUDA — up from zero.

## Key strengths

- **CPU leadership**: EPYC server CPUs taking share from Intel
- **Chiplet architecture**: Cost-effective multi-die designs
- **NodAI acquisition**: Reshaping org around software-hardware co-design
- **Underdog positioning**: Lower expectations, cheaper valuation

## Manufacturing relationships

| Foundry | Relationship | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| [[TSMC]] | Primary | Capacity constrained, locked out of some 2nm |
| [[Samsung]] | Potential | In talks for 2nm EPYC Venice (Jan 2026 decision) |

AMD is one of the customers forced to [[Samsung]] because [[TSMC]] 2nm locked by Apple/NVIDIA.

## Competitive position

| Market | vs Competitor | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Server CPU | Intel | Winning — taking share |
| AI/GPU | [[NVIDIA]] | Behind, but software improving |
| Desktop | Intel | Competitive |

## Key catalysts

- [ ] NodAI-driven software improvements gain traction
- [ ] ROCm reaches CUDA parity for key workloads
- [ ] Samsung 2nm deal closes (Jan 2026)
- [ ] Hyperscalers adopt AMD AI chips at scale

---

## Key risks

- CUDA moat holds — software gap doesn't close
- **NVIDIA infrastructure expansion** — SLURM acquisition (Dec 2025) adds another layer AMD users depend on
- Samsung yields disappoint — supply/cost disadvantage
- NVIDIA extends hardware lead (Blackwell, etc.)
- Intel recovers in server CPUs

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Primary foundry | [[TSMC]] |
| Potential foundry | [[Samsung]] (2nm EPYC) |
| Key acquisition | NodAI (late 2023) |

---

## Market expectations

**Priced in:**
- CPU gains vs Intel continue
- AI remains NVIDIA-dominated
- TSMC remains primary foundry

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Software closes gap → AI share gains
- Samsung deal + good yields → cost advantage
- Hyperscaler adoption accelerates

---

## For theses

- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — potential Samsung 2nm customer, validates Korea demand
- [[Long TSMC]] — if AMD stays TSMC, reinforces moat; if leaves, tests it
