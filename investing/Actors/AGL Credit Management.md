Gleysteen is a **40+ year veteran** of the leveraged loan market. He was integral to the evolution of the syndicated loan market from a bank product to an institutional asset class. The "Market Flex" innovation allowed arrangers to adjust pricing during syndication — a mechanism that became the backbone of the modern leveraged loan market.

## Business model

### Core: CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations)

AGL's bread and butter. They buy portfolios of senior secured leveraged loans, package them into tranched CLO vehicles, and manage the portfolio actively.

**"Private side asymmetrical advantage"** — As a direct lender/agent, AGL has access to non-public borrower information that public-side-only credit investors cannot see. This creates an information edge for credit selection.

**10-D Portfolio Construction Framework** — Proprietary risk model across 10 dimensions focused on loss avoidance and minimizing intra-asset correlation. The emphasis is on avoiding defaults rather than reaching for yield.

| CLO metric | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Vehicles priced | 30+ (through mid-2024) |
| 2025 milestone | 10 CLOs priced at historically tight AAA spreads |
| Multi-format | BSL CLOs, Core CLOs (innovative structures for varying investor profiles) |
| Geography | US + Western Europe |

### Growth engine: AGL Private Credit Platform (launched Apr 2024)

**Exclusive cooperation agreement with [[Barclays]]:**
- Barclays originates private credit loans → AGL gets exclusive access to the pipeline
- Targets large, directly originated loans for sponsor-backed companies
- Gives AGL + Barclays clients "full spectrum of large cap leveraged financing solutions"
- ADIA backing for the platform (commitment size undisclosed; ADIA has 2-7% target allocation to credit strategies across its $993B portfolio)
- Entering the **$1.7T private credit market** from a position of strength (CLO track record + Barclays origination)

This is a powerful structural advantage: most private credit firms originate their own deals (expensive, relationship-dependent). AGL gets Barclays' origination pipe on an exclusive basis — bank-quality deal flow without running a bank.

### BDC: AGL Private Credit Income Fund

Registered business development company providing senior secured term loans and first-lien facilities. Run by AGL US DL Management LLC (affiliated adviser).

## Investment culture

Gleysteen explicitly emphasizes **"loss avoidance"** over yield maximization. This conservative credit culture — unusual in the CLO space where reaching for spread is the norm — may prove a differentiator in the current environment of rising private credit defaults.

Key quotes:
- Focus on "secure, stable and scalable cash yield-driven returns"
- "Intensive focus on loss avoidance to underpin investment performance"

## Context: private credit stress (Feb 2026)

AGL operates at the center of the private credit ecosystem currently under pressure:
- [[BlackRock|TCPC]] (BDC) cut dividend 32%
- **Blue Owl Capital** halted retail fund withdrawals
- **[[KKR]]/Future Standard** BDC also cutting dividends
- UBS warns AI disruption could push private credit defaults to 15%

AGL's conservative "loss avoidance" culture and focus on senior secured (top of the capital stack) may provide relative insulation vs peers who reached for yield in lower-quality credits. The Barclays origination channel also gives access to higher-quality large-cap deals vs middle-market lending where stress is concentrated.

---

## Bottom line

Strong shop. $0 to $21B in 6 years, CLO Manager of the Year back-to-back, founded by a guy who literally helped invent how leveraged loans are priced (Market Flex, 1997). ADIA anchor money + exclusive Barclays origination pipe means they get first look at high-quality large-cap deals without competing in the open market.

In the current private credit stress environment — where TCPC is cutting dividends, Blue Owl is gating redemptions, and UBS is warning about 15% default rates — AGL's positioning looks relatively defensive: senior secured (top of capital stack), loss-avoidance culture, and large-cap focus (vs the middle-market lending where the pain is concentrated).

The risk: they're still a CLO/private credit shop at the end of the day. If credit broadly deteriorates, even senior secured takes hits. And they've been scaling fast during the easy money era — $14B to $21B in one year is aggressive growth.
