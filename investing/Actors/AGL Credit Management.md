## Business model

**"Private side asymmetrical advantage"** — AGL uses non-public lender information (available as a direct lender/agent) to make credit decisions. This is a structural edge over public-side-only credit funds.

**10-dimensional portfolio construction framework** — proprietary risk model focused on loss avoidance and minimizing intra-asset correlation across the loan book.
