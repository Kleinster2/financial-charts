**Solana** — High-throughput layer-1 blockchain. Known for fast finality (~400ms) and low fees. Growing presence for [[Tether|USDT]] and [[Circle|USDC]] issuance. Emerged as leading alternative to [[Ethereum]] for DeFi and consumer crypto applications after surviving the FTX collapse (Alameda was an early backer).
