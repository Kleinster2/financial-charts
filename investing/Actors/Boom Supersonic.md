## Programs

### XB-1 demonstrator

One-third-scale supersonic demonstrator validating aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion for Overture.

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Rollout | Oct 2020 |
| First flight | Mar 22, 2024 (Mojave, CA) |
| First supersonic (Flight 12) | Jan 28, 2025 (Mach 1.122, 35,290 ft) |
| Final flight (Flight 13) | Feb 10, 2025 |
| Total flights | 13 |
| Status | Retired (displayed in Boom HQ lobby) |
| Test pilot | Tristan "Geppetto" Brandenburg |

First privately-funded aircraft to break the sound barrier. Achieved supersonic flight without audible sonic boom reaching ground (Mach cutoff phenomenon).

### Overture airliner

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Speed | Mach 1.7 |
| Engines | 4x Symphony (40,000 lbs thrust each) |
| Passengers | 64-80 (all business class) |
| Range | ~4,250 nmi |
| Length | 201 ft |
| Cruise altitude | 61,000 ft max |
| Construction | Carbon composite |
| Fuel | 100% SAF compatible |
| Target fare | ~$5,000 RT NYC-London |
| Sonic boom | Boomless Cruise up to Mach 1.3 over land -- no audible boom on ground |
| Noise | ICAO Chapter 14 compliant |
| Manufacturing | Overture Superfactory, Greensboro, NC |
| Production rate | 33/year initially, 66/year with 2nd line |

### Symphony engine

Clean-sheet medium-bypass turbofan. Supersonic cruise without afterburners.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Partners | Florida Turbine Technologies (design), StandardAero (maintenance), Colibrium Additive (3D-printed components) |
| Core prototype | "Sprint" -- 12 ft long, 4 ft diameter |
| Parts status | 95% of core parts in manufacturing (late 2025), 50 completed |
| Hardware sharing | ~80% shared between Symphony (jet) and Superpower (turbine) |
| Core testing | Mid-2026 at Colorado Air & Space Port |
| Full turbofan test | Late 2026 (expanded facility) |

Boom developing in-house after Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, GE, CFM, and Safran all declined.

### Superpower (AI data center turbines)

Leveraging Symphony engine core technology for natural gas turbines powering AI data centers.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Output | 42 MW per unit (natural gas) |
| Form factor | ISO shipping container size |
| Water | Waterless operation (hot/arid deployment) |
| Temperature | Full output at 110+ deg F ambient |
| Launch customer | [[Crusoe Energy]] -- 29 units = 1.21 GW |
| Backlog | >$1.25B |
| Price | $1,033/kW to Crusoe |
| First integrated turbine | Late 2026 (test stand) |
| First delivery | 2027 |
| Production ramp | 1 GW/yr (2028), 2 GW/yr (2029), 4 GW/yr (2030) |

Revenue from Superpower funds Overture certification and delivery. Operational data feeds jet engine reliability program.

## Regulatory tailwind

Jun 2025: President Trump signed executive order lifting the 52-year FAA ban (14 CFR 91.817) on supersonic flight over US land. Dramatically expands Overture's viable route network.

Dec 2025: Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act passed House committee (bipartisan). ICAO adopted new global supersonic noise standards (Apr 2025). FAA has 18-month deadline for NPRM on supersonic noise certification.

## Investment case

Bull:
- XB-1 validated supersonic flight + Boomless Cruise
- 130 aircraft ordered by 3 major airlines
- Supersonic overland ban lifted (Jun 2025)
- Superpower provides revenue before Overture delivers
- $1.25B Crusoe contract de-risks engine development

Bear:
- Symphony engine is clean-sheet, unproven at scale
- Every major engine OEM declined to build it
- Timeline has slipped multiple times
- Total program cost ~$12B; only ~$700M raised so far
- Concorde precedent -- supersonic commercial aviation failed before
- [[Aerion Supersonic]] collapsed May 2021 after 17 years and 300+ orders -- cautionary tale
- Virgin Group options expired 2023 (early customer attrition)
- Post-737 MAX, FAA scrutiny on new type certificates is intense
- Both co-founders (Wilding, Krall) have departed
