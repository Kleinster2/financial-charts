## Programs

### XB-1 demonstrator

One-third-scale supersonic demonstrator validating aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion for Overture.

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| First flight | Mar 2024 (Mojave, CA) |
| First supersonic flight | Jan 28, 2025 |
| Boomless Cruise validated | Feb 2025 (6 sonic-boom-free supersonic flights) |

First independently-developed supersonic jet to break the sound barrier.

### Overture airliner

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Speed | Mach 1.7 |
| Engines | 4x Symphony (40,000 lbs thrust each) |
| Passengers | 64-80 |
| Range | ~4,250 nmi |
| Sonic boom | Boomless Cruise -- no audible boom on ground |
| Manufacturing | Overture Superfactory, Greensboro, NC |
| Production rate | 33/year initially, 66/year with 2nd line |

### Symphony engine

Clean-sheet medium-bypass turbofan. Supersonic cruise without afterburners.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Partners | Florida Turbine Technologies (design), StandardAero (maintenance), Colibrium Additive (3D-printed components) |
| Status | 95% of core prototype parts in manufacturing (late 2025) |
| Testing | Slated to begin 2026 at Colorado Air & Space Port |
| Full-scale test | 2026 (expanded facility) |

Boom developing in-house after Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, GE, CFM, and Safran all declined.

### Superpower (AI data center turbines)

Leveraging Symphony engine core technology for natural gas turbines powering AI data centers. Provides gigawatts of new capacity. $1.25B contract with [[Crusoe Energy]] secured. Revenue from Superpower funds Overture certification and delivery.

## Regulatory tailwind

Jun 2025: President Trump signed executive order lifting the 52-year FAA ban (14 CFR 91.817) on supersonic flight over US land. Dramatically expands Overture's viable route network.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Symphony engine testing | 2026 |
| Overture flight tests | 2027 |
| Commercial operations | ~2029-2030 |

## Investment case

Bull:
- XB-1 validated supersonic flight + Boomless Cruise
- 130 aircraft ordered by 3 major airlines
- Supersonic overland ban lifted (Jun 2025)
- Superpower provides revenue before Overture delivers
- $1.25B Crusoe contract de-risks engine development

Bear:
- Symphony engine is clean-sheet, unproven at scale
- Every major engine OEM declined to build it
- Timeline has slipped multiple times
- Capital-intensive with long path to certification
- Concorde precedent -- supersonic commercial aviation failed before
- Employee count reportedly declined 43% in 2024
