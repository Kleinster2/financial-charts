## Key strengths

- **Silicon design**: Best-in-class mobile SoCs, now expanding to Mac (M-series)
- **TSMC relationship**: Deepest co-design partnership, first access to new nodes
- **Vertical integration**: Hardware + software + silicon under one roof
- **Volume**: Highest volume customer at leading edge — locks capacity

---

## Manufacturing relationship

| Foundry | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Exclusive for leading edge — A-series, M-series |

Apple is TSMC's largest customer and has locked 2nm capacity alongside [[NVIDIA]].

---

## Design excellence evidence

**A19 (Dec 2025)**:
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node gave 4% — rest from design optimization
- 2x cache density, layout efficiency gains
- Years of co-optimization with TSMC

This is [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] in action — accumulated knowledge that competitors can't replicate.

## App Tracking Transparency (ATT)

Privacy feature launched April 2021 (iOS 14.5) that reshaped digital advertising.

**How it works:**
- Pop-up asks users if they want apps to track them
- 75%+ opt out (higher for social media apps)
- Blocks IDFA tracking — advertisers can't see cross-app behavior
- Breaks targeted advertising models

**Industry impact (2022):**

| Company | Revenue hit | Stock impact |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [[Meta]] | ~$10B | -26% single day (Feb 2022), -74% peak-to-trough |
| [[Snap]] | ~$546M | -25% (Oct 2021) |
| [[Google\|YouTube]] | ~$2.2B | Less severe (search ads unaffected) |
| Twitter | ~$323M | — |

**Total industry loss:** ~$16B in 2022. US alone lost estimated $15B.

**Why Apple did it:**
- Privacy as brand differentiator
- Weakens competitors reliant on ad targeting
- Services revenue (App Store) unaffected — even benefits from ad spend shifting to Apple Search Ads

**Winners:**
- Apple Search Ads — gained share as Facebook ads became less effective
- First-party data companies
- Contextual advertising

ATT demonstrated Apple's platform power — one policy change wiped $230B from Meta's market cap in a single day.

## Why it matters for this vault

- Locks [[TSMC]] leading edge capacity
- Forces [[AMD]], Google, others to alternatives like [[Samsung]]
- Demonstrates value of deep foundry relationships
- Sets the bar for silicon design at each node

## Local AI hardware demand (Feb 2025)

**Mac Mini experiencing supply chain squeeze** — attributed partly to [[Local-first AI]] agent demand.

The [[Clawdbot viral growth|Clawdbot phenomenon]] (82k+ GitHub stars) triggered a wave of developers setting up local AI infrastructure:
- AI gateway requires 16-64GB+ RAM
- Mac Mini = popular choice for always-on agent host
- Buying frenzy partly a hedge against [[Memory squeeze thesis|rising memory costs]]

Combined with [[HBM economics]] squeezing consumer DRAM supply, the window for affordable local AI hardware may be closing.

---

## Memory cost impact (Nov 2025)

**CFO Kevan Parekh — most sanguine assessment among OEMs:**
- Acknowledged "slight tailwind" on memory prices
- Some new products have "slightly higher cost structure"
- But stressed Apple is "managing costs well"

**Why Apple is insulated:**
- Top customer status — leverage with memory suppliers
- Volume commitments secure supply + better pricing
- Premium pricing absorbs cost increases
- Unlike [[Dell]], [[HP Inc.]], [[Xiaomi]] — not a value player

**Contrast with peers:**

| OEM         | Response                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Apple**   | "Managing costs well"                |
| [[Dell]]    | "Never seen costs move at this rate" |
| [[Lenovo]]  | Hoarding 50% extra inventory         |
| [[HP Inc.]] | Warning of H2 2026 price hikes       |
| [[Xiaomi]]  | +25% DRAM cost per phone             |

Apple's scale + premium positioning = memory shortage hedge.

## AI devices portfolio (Jan 2026)

Apple developing multiple AI-powered devices. Most ambitious hardware push since Apple Watch.

### AI Pin

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Size | AirTag-sized |
| Features | Multiple cameras, speaker, mics, wireless charging |
| [[Target]] launch | **2027** |
| Production target | **20M units** |

**Context:** [[Humane]] AI Pin sold poorly. Apple betting on execution + ecosystem. 20M units = 10x Meta Rayban's lifetime sales (2M).

### Other AI devices in development

| Device | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Smart home hub** | Spring 2026 | Display, speakers, **robotic swiveling base** |
| **Smart glasses** | In development | Competing with [[Meta]] Raybans |
| **AR glasses** | In development | Full augmented reality |
| **Enhanced AirPods** | In development | AI sensors |
| **Security camera** | In development | AI-powered |

### Siri upgrade ("Campos")

Major Siri overhaul underway (codename "Campos"):
- **Chatbot-style interaction** — conversational turns
- **On-screen content analysis** — see what you're looking at
- **Personal data integration** — tap into apps, calendar, files
- **Universal search** — better web + app results

Powered by [[Google]] [[Gemini]] under multiyear deal (see [[Apple-Google AI deal]]).

**Timeline (updated Feb 12, 2026):**
- ~~iOS 26.4 (March)~~ — many capabilities **pushed to iOS 26.5 (May/June)**
- **Personal context features** (tap into apps, calendar, files) — likely **iOS 27 (September)**
- Full chatbot revamp expected with **iOS 27** alongside fall iPhone launch
- Features may ship ~2 years after initial WWDC 2024 announcement

**Feb 12 snag (Bloomberg/Gurman):** Testing setbacks in recent weeks forced staggered rollout. Gurman: Google Gemini collaboration is the reason Apple will still ship this year — Apple's own models being improved by Gemini team. Competitive risk: [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Google]] will be further ahead by September.

**Privacy:** Runs through [[Apple]] devices and [[Private Cloud Compute]]. Tim Cook (Q1 FY26 call): Gemini-powered Siri will be personalized but won't access users' Gmail or Google data.

### Q.ai acquisition (Jan 2026)

[[Apple acquires Q.ai|Acquired Q.ai]] for ~$2B — second-largest acquisition ever after [[Beats]].

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | ~$2B |
| Technology | Silent speech from facial micro-movements |
| CEO | [[Aviad Maizels]] (previously sold [[PrimeSense]] → Face ID) |
| Team | ~100 employees |

**Strategic value:** Enables non-verbal Siri commands through AirPods, Vision Pro, future glasses. Differentiated approach vs pure LLM competitors.

Tim Cook (Q3 2025): "We're open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap." This is the first major AI acquisition under that mandate.

**Competitive context:** [[Google]] says its AI glasses shipping 2026. [[Demis Hassabis]]: "one of the things I'm personally working on."

## Rare earth supply chain

Apple is hedging against [[China]]'s [[Rare earth leverage]]:

### MP Materials partnership (July 2025)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Value | $500M |
| Partner | [[MP Materials]] |
| Product | Recycled rare earth magnets |
| Facility | Fort Worth, Texas |
| Shipments | Begin 2027 |
| Volume | Hundreds of millions of devices |

**Recycling innovation**: 5 years of pilot work. Commercial-scale line at Mountain Pass will process end-of-life devices and magnet scrap.

**Strategic logic**: [[China]] controls 90%+ of rare earth magnet production. Apple is building domestic supply before a crisis forces it.

### Limitation

[[MP Materials]] does light rare earths (neodymium, praseodymium). [[Dysprosium]] — the critical heavy REE for high-temp magnets — still comes from [[China]]. This hedges some risk, not all.

## Nasdaq decoupling — the "anti-AI" trade (Feb 2026)

![[aapl-qqq-40d-correlation.png]]
*40-day rolling correlation between AAPL and QQQ. Red dashed line = current 0.21 level (lowest since 2006).*

Apple's 40-day correlation to the [[Nasdaq]] 100 dropped to **0.21** in Feb 2026 — the lowest since 2006 and down from 0.92 in May 2025. Apple has become the market's "anti-AI" safe haven.

| Metric | AAPL | Nasdaq 100 | Mag 7 Index |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Feb 2026 MTD | **+1.7%** | -3.3% | -7.5% (worst since March) |

**Why Apple is insulated:**
- Not participating in AI capex spending bonanza
- No major business line at risk from [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude-style disruption]]
- Hardware > software in AI disruption calculus
- Record quarterly sales (Jan 2026), strong iPhone, better-than-expected outlook

Art Hogan (B. Riley Wealth, $25B AUM): "We're in an environment of AI whack-a-mole, where investors are so nervous about what will be disrupted next they're shooting first and asking questions later."

Wayne Kaufman (Phoenix Financial): "There's a lot less risk for hardware than software. Regardless of anything else, people can't use AI to code themselves a new iPhone."

**The catch:** 30x forward P/E — higher than every Mag 7 peer except [[Tesla]]. Revenue growth decelerating (11% FY2026 → 6.7% FY2027). Not a bargain — the market is giving it "benefit of the doubt" as a volatility hedge.
