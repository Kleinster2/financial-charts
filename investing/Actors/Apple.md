# Apple (AAPL)

Consumer electronics giant with world-class silicon design team. TSMC's anchor customer.

---

## Core thesis

Apple's silicon team extracts more value from TSMC nodes than any competitor. The A-series and M-series chips demonstrate design excellence that compounds TSMC's process advantages.

---

## Key strengths

- **Silicon design**: Best-in-class mobile SoCs, now expanding to Mac (M-series)
- **TSMC relationship**: Deepest co-design partnership, first access to new nodes
- **Vertical integration**: Hardware + software + silicon under one roof
- **Volume**: Highest volume customer at leading edge — locks capacity

---

## Manufacturing relationship

| Foundry | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Exclusive for leading edge — A-series, M-series |

Apple is TSMC's largest customer and has locked 2nm capacity alongside [[NVIDIA]].

---

## Design excellence evidence

**A19 (Dec 2025)**:
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node gave 4% — rest from design optimization
- 2x cache density, layout efficiency gains
- Years of co-optimization with TSMC

This is [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] in action — accumulated knowledge that competitors can't replicate.

---

## Why it matters for this vault

- Locks [[TSMC]] leading edge capacity
- Forces [[AMD]], Google, others to alternatives like [[Samsung]]
- Demonstrates value of deep foundry relationships
- Sets the bar for silicon design at each node

---

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: Apple relationship proves co-design moat depth

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Apple locking capacity forces others to Samsung — bullish Korea demand
