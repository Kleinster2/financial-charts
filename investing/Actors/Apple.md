# Apple (AAPL)

Consumer electronics giant with world-class silicon design team. TSMC's anchor customer.

---

## Core thesis

Apple's silicon team extracts more value from TSMC nodes than any competitor. The A-series and M-series chips demonstrate design excellence that compounds TSMC's process advantages.

---

## Key strengths

- **Silicon design**: Best-in-class mobile SoCs, now expanding to Mac (M-series)
- **TSMC relationship**: Deepest co-design partnership, first access to new nodes
- **Vertical integration**: Hardware + software + silicon under one roof
- **Volume**: Highest volume customer at leading edge — locks capacity

---

## Manufacturing relationship

| Foundry | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Exclusive for leading edge — A-series, M-series |

Apple is TSMC's largest customer and has locked 2nm capacity alongside [[NVIDIA]].

---

## Design excellence evidence

**A19 (Dec 2025)**:
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node gave 4% — rest from design optimization
- 2x cache density, layout efficiency gains
- Years of co-optimization with TSMC

This is [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] in action — accumulated knowledge that competitors can't replicate.

---

## Why it matters for this vault

- Locks [[TSMC]] leading edge capacity
- Forces [[AMD]], Google, others to alternatives like [[Samsung]]
- Demonstrates value of deep foundry relationships
- Sets the bar for silicon design at each node

## Rare earth supply chain

Apple is hedging against China's [[Rare earth leverage]]:

### MP Materials partnership (July 2025)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Value | $500M |
| Partner | [[MP Materials]] |
| Product | Recycled rare earth magnets |
| Facility | Fort Worth, Texas |
| Shipments | Begin 2027 |
| Volume | Hundreds of millions of devices |

**Recycling innovation**: 5 years of pilot work. Commercial-scale line at Mountain Pass will process end-of-life devices and magnet scrap.

**Strategic logic**: China controls 90%+ of rare earth magnet production. Apple is building domestic supply before a crisis forces it.

### Limitation

[[MP Materials]] does light rare earths (neodymium, praseodymium). [[Dysprosium]] — the critical heavy REE for high-temp magnets — still comes from China. This hedges some risk, not all.

---

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: Apple relationship proves co-design moat depth

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Apple locking capacity forces others to Samsung — bullish Korea demand

## Short interest history (quarterly)

| Quarter | SI % float | Stock | Note |
|---------|------------|-------|------|
| **Q1 2026** | **0.78%** | ~$230 | Low — shorts capitulated |
| Q4 2025 | 0.71% | $— | |
| Q3 2025 | — | $— | |
| Q2 2025 | — | $— | |
