## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Multi-year defense spending cycle
- €40B+ backlog = visibility
- Ammunition monopoly in Europe
- Consolidator role
- Trump pressure keeps NATO spending up
- Not priced for 2030 potential

**Bear:**
- +400% already — priced in?
- Peace could reduce urgency
- Execution risk on production ramp
- Government customer concentration
- Cyclical risk if spending peaks
