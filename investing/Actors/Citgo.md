**Citgo Petroleum Corporation** — US-based refiner, transporter, and marketer of gasoline, lubricants, and petrochemicals. Wholly owned by **[[PDVSA]]**, the state-owned oil company of Venezuela. A critical, yet legally embattled, asset in the US-Venezuela oil equation.

## Current Status (Jan 2026)

*   **Ownership:** Legally, still owned by PDVSA. Functionally, control has been contested for years between the Maduro regime, Venezuelan opposition, and various creditors. Post-[[Maduro capture 2026]], its future ownership and use are central to the Venezuelan rebuild.
*   **Control:** Currently overseen by a US-recognized board appointed by the Venezuelan opposition (now likely transitioning to a US-backed interim government board).
*   **Financials:** Profitable, but profits have been targeted by creditors of Venezuela and PDVSA.
*   **Strategic Role:** Key US refining asset for processing heavy Venezuelan crude. Provides market access for future Venezuelan oil production.

## Legal & Financial Entanglements

*   **Creditor Claims:** Numerous creditors (e.g., [[ConocoPhillips]], Crystallex, bondholders) have pursued legal actions to seize or force sale of Citgo assets to satisfy debts owed by Venezuela or PDVSA.
*   **"2020 Bonds":** Controversial PDVSA bonds collateralized by 50.1% of Citgo's parent company. Litigation ongoing.
*   **Political Football:** Its ownership and disposition are highly sensitive, tied to US foreign policy towards Venezuela and efforts to compensate claimants.
*   **Post-Maduro:** A US-backed interim government will need to decide whether to sell Citgo to repay creditors, retain it as a strategic asset for Venezuela, or use it as a bargaining chip.

## Relevance to Venezuela Oil Rebuild Thesis

*   **Natural Market:** Citgo's Gulf Coast refineries are ideally suited to process the heavy, sour crude from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. Re-establishing this supply chain is highly efficient.
*   **Immediate Outlet:** Provides an immediate, stable market for any ramp-up in Venezuelan crude production.
*   **Financial Leverage:** The value of Citgo's assets could be used to raise capital for PDVSA's rebuild, either through sale or as collateral for new loans, once legal disputes are resolved.
*   **Refiner Perspective:** Viewed by [[Gulf Coast refiners]] as a competitor for Venezuelan crude, but also as part of the overall market for heavy barrels.
