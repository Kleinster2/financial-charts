## Why Enphase matters

Enphase dominates residential solar electronics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #1 microinverters (US residential) |
| Differentiation | Software, reliability, ecosystem |
| Attach rate | Batteries, EV chargers |
| Margin profile | High-margin vs commodity inverters |

## Microinverters vs string inverters

| Aspect | Microinverters (Enphase) | String ([[SolarEdge]]) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Architecture | One per panel | One for array |
| Cost | Higher | Lower |
| Reliability | Panel-level, no single point of failure | Central failure risk |
| Monitoring | Per-panel | Per-array |
| Market | Residential | Residential + commercial |

---

## Product ecosystem

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| IQ Microinverters | Core product, panel-level conversion |
| IQ Batteries | Home energy storage |
| IQ EV Chargers | Electric vehicle charging |
| Enlighten | Software platform, monitoring |

**Strategy:** Own the home energy ecosystem.

## AI/Data center relevance

**Indirect connection:**
- Grid stability as solar grows
- Behind-the-meter storage for resilience
- Virtual power plants (VPP) aggregation
- Not directly powering data centers

## Challenges (2023-2025)

| Headwind | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| High interest rates | Solar financing harder |
| California NEM 3.0 | Reduced solar economics |
| European slowdown | Inventory glut |
| Competition | Chinese inverters cheaper |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Premium brand, high margins
- Battery attach opportunity
- IRA tailwinds (domestic manufacturing)
- Software moat
- Grid services revenue potential

**Bear:**
- Interest rate sensitivity
- NEM 3.0 demand destruction
- Chinese competition
- Inventory overhang
- Valuation still elevated
