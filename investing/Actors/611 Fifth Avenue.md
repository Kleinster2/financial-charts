## Valuation history

| Year | Appraisal | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **2013** | — | HBC bought entire Saks chain for $2.9B |
| **2014** | **$3.7B** | Flagship alone worth more than acquisition |
| **2019** | **$1.6B** | [[Retail apocalypse]], rent collapse |
| **2024** | **$3.6B** | Recovery, [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] rebound |

**The paradox:** The building has consistently been worth more than HBC paid for all of Saks ($2.9B in 2013).

## Ownership structure

### Corporate hierarchy

The flagship sits in a **separate legal structure** — isolated in SPVs (special purpose vehicles):

```
Saks Global Holdings LLC (parent debtor)
    └── Saks Fifth Avenue HoldCo LLC ("HoldCo II")
            └── Saks Flagship Real Property LLC ("Flagship PropCo")
                    └── Owns 611 Fifth Avenue (building + land)
```

| Entity | Purpose | Key fact |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **HoldCo II** | Holding company | Where [[Amazon]] invested; Amazon has consent rights |
| **Flagship PropCo** | Property SPV | Owns the actual building and land |

**Why this matters:** Amazon invested at HoldCo II level, expecting consent rights would protect the flagship. But HoldCo II is "member-managed" with no independent directors — decisions roll up to Saks management, who chose to subordinate Amazon to bondholders.

### The ground vs. the building

| Component | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Ground/land** | [[Saks Global]] / HBC (via Flagship PropCo) | Mortgaged in 2014 |
| **1924 building** | [[Saks Global]] / HBC (via Flagship PropCo) | Retail operations |
| **1990 tower** | [[623 Fifth Avenue]] (separate) | [[Cohen Brothers Realty]], being sold to [[Vornado]] |

### 2014 mortgage

HBC **originated** (not assumed) a $1.25B mortgage in November 2014:

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Amount | $1.25B |
| Collateral | **Ground + [[ground lease]] only** (NOT the building) |
| Term | 20-year, interest-only |
| Rate | Fixed, <4.40% |
| Lenders | BofA, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Nova Scotia |

**Use of proceeds:** Paid down $1.2B of HBC's floating-rate term loan (4.75%, maturing 2020). Essentially swapped corporate debt for real estate-secured debt.

**S&P noted:** "The Saks Fifth Avenue building is not collateral for the loan (only the land and the lease on the land secure the loan)."

## Construction history

### 1920-1924: The dream store

**Founders:** Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel (cousins, rival Herald Square merchants)

**Site acquisition:**
- Saks & Company leased the Buckingham Hotel and Belgravia Apartments site in April 1920 for $35M
- National Democratic Club at 617 Fifth Ave refused $1M offer; Saks initially planned U-shaped building around it
- Eventually acquired full block

**Construction:**
- Built 1922-1924
- Cost: ~$3 million
- First large retailer in what was then residential Fifth Avenue
- Opened September 15, 1924

**Tragedy:** Horace Saks died suddenly in 1926 (septic poisoning), age ~34. Adam Gimbel became president.

### 1990: Tower addition

[[623 Fifth Avenue]] — 36-story office tower built behind the store using air rights from the 1924 building. Saks occupies ~80,000 sq ft on lower floors.

## Role in [[Saks bankruptcy]]

The building became the central asset in the January 2026 bankruptcy:

1. **Aug 2024:** HBC raised $600M using flagship as collateral — without [[Amazon]]'s consent
2. **Jan 2026:** Flagship pledged for $1.75B [[DIP financing]]
3. **Court fight:** [[Amazon]] objected; argued flagship was already pledged to secure their interests
4. **Ruling:** Judge Perez approved DIP, subordinating Amazon behind bondholders

**Key insight:** In distress, the real estate was the leverage — not brand equity, not tech partnerships, not digital scale.
