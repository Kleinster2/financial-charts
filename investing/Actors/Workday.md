| Subscription revenue | $2,360M | $2,040M | +15.7% |
| Professional services | $172M | $171M | +0.6% |

| GAAP diluted EPS | $0.55 | $0.35 | +57% |
| Non-GAAP diluted EPS | $2.47 | $1.95 | +27% |
| Operating cash flow | $1,278M | $1,113M | +15% |
| Free cash flow | $1,218M | $1,026M | +19% |

*Q4 GAAP operating income depressed by $130M restructuring charge (vs $75M in Q4 FY25). Non-GAAP margins expanded 420bps YoY to 30.6%. Beat consensus EPS by $0.17 ($2.47 vs $2.30 est).*

### Full Year FY2026

| Metric | FY2026 | FY2025 | YoY |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Total revenue | $9,552M | $8,446M | +13.1% |
| Subscription revenue | $8,833M | $7,718M | +14.5% |
| GAAP operating income | $721M | $415M | +74% |
| Non-GAAP operating margin | 29.6% | 25.9% | |
| GAAP net income | $693M | $526M | +32% |
| GAAP diluted EPS | $2.59 | $1.95 | +33% |
| Operating cash flow | $2,939M | $2,461M | +19.4% |
| Free cash flow | $2,777M | $2,192M | +27% |
| Total SBC | $1,626M | $1,519M | +7% |

### Backlog

| Metric | Jan 31, 2026 | YoY |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| 12-month subscription backlog | $8,833M | +15.8% |
| Total subscription backlog | $28,101M | +12.2% |

### FY2027 guidance

| Metric | Guidance |
|--------|---------|
| Q1 FY27 subscription revenue | $2,335M (+13%) |
| Q1 FY27 non-GAAP operating margin | 30.5% |
| FY27 subscription revenue | $9,925–$9,950M (+12–13%) |
| FY27 non-GAAP operating margin | 30.0% |

*FY27 subscription guidance of $9.93–9.95B fell short of $10B analyst consensus, triggering a -10% selloff. Growth decelerating from 14.5% to 12–13%. The market reads this as structural: agentic AI threatens the seat-based SaaS licensing model that underpins Workday's economics.*

### Balance sheet (Jan 31, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cash + marketable securities | $5,443M |
| Total debt (noncurrent) | $2,987M |
| Unearned revenue (current) | $5,010M |
| Share repurchases (FY26) | $2.9B (~12.8M shares) |
| Goodwill | $5,229M |

![[wday-vs-now-crm-price-chart.png]]
*WDAY (blue) vs [[ServiceNow]] and [[Salesforce]] since Jan 2024. WDAY down ~50%, dramatically lagging enterprise SaaS peers. The Feb 2026 post-earnings crash to 52-week lows (~$117) reflects both weak guidance and broader agentic AI anxiety.*

![[wday-fundamentals.png]]
*Quarterly revenue (blue) and net income (red). Revenue growth steady at mid-teens, but net income volatile due to restructuring charges ($303M in FY26 vs $84M in FY25). Q1 FY26 net income trough ($68M) reflects restructuring from the Bhusri CEO transition.*

| Heavy SBC | $1.6B in FY26 (17% of revenue) |
| Restructuring cycle | $303M charges in FY26 under CEO transition |
| Competition | [[SAP]], [[Oracle]], [[ServiceNow]] |
| Analyst downgrades | [[Jefferies]], [[Evercore ISI]] downgraded post-Q4; [[JPMorgan]] cut target to $230 |

## Investment case

Bull:
- 97%+ gross retention — deeply embedded in enterprise HR/finance workflows
- $2.8B free cash flow at 29% FCF margin
- $5.4B cash vs $3.0B debt — clean balance sheet
- $28.1B total backlog provides revenue visibility
- Aggressive buyback ($2.9B in FY26) shrinking float
- Non-GAAP operating margins expanding (25.9% → 29.6%)

Bear:
- Subscription growth decelerating (14.5% → 12–13% guided)
- Agentic AI could structurally undermine per-seat pricing — the core revenue model
- GAAP operating margins still thin (7.5%) due to $1.6B SBC and $303M restructuring
- $5.2B goodwill from acquisition spree ([[Paradox]], [[Sana]], [[Pipedream]])
- Competition from [[SAP]], [[Oracle]], [[ServiceNow]] with their own AI strategies
- Elliott activist thesis hasn't translated to value creation
