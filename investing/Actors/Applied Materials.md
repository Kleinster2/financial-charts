# Applied Materials (AMAT)

Largest semiconductor equipment company by revenue. Broadest portfolio across WFE segments.

---

## Core thesis

Applied Materials is the most diversified WFE play. Exposure across deposition, etch, implant, and inspection. Benefits from any fab buildout regardless of memory vs logic mix.

---

## What they do

| Segment | Description | Position |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Deposition (CVD, PVD) | Deposits thin films | Leader |
| Etch | Removes material | Strong (\#2 to Lam) |
| Ion implant | Dopes silicon with impurities | Leader |
| CMP | Chemical-mechanical polishing | Strong |
| Inspection | Process control | Growing |

Broadest portfolio = most diversified exposure.

## Exposure

| End market | Exposure | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Logic/Foundry | ~55% | TSMC, Samsung, [[Intel]] |
| Memory | ~30% | DRAM, NAND, [[HBM]] |
| Services | ~15% | Installed base support |

More balanced than Lam (memory-heavy) or ASML (logic-heavy).

## Customer concentration (FY25)

| Customer | FY25 growth | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| [[TSMC]] | +80% y/y | ATH, ~40% of foundry/logic revenue |
| [[Samsung]] | +31% y/y | Recovery |
| [[China]] | -16% y/y | [[Export controls]] impact |

TSMC is the dominant driver — leading edge GAA ramp.

## GAA opportunity

GAA (gate-all-around) is the transistor architecture for 2nm and beyond, replacing FinFET.

- **FY25 GAA revenue**: $4.5B (mostly TSMC)
- **AMAT GAA share**: 50%+ of GAA and backside power SAM
- **Incremental revenue**: +30% per fab vs FinFET
- **Runway**: GAA capacity to triple from current levels

This is a structural tailwind — more complex transistors = more AMAT tools per fab.

---

## Key advantages

- **Scale**: Largest WFE company, most R&D spending
- **Breadth**: Sells into every fab, every process
- **Services**: Large installed base = recurring revenue
- **[[China]]**: Significant exposure (risk and opportunity)

---

## [[China]] exposure / risk

- Meaningful revenue from [[China]] (trailing edge)
- [[Export controls]] limit advanced tool sales
- Domestic [[China]] push could pressure pricing
- Risk: further restrictions reduce TAM

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | AMAT (NASDAQ) |
| Revenue | ~$27B (FY24) |
| Segment | Diversified WFE |
| Primary customers | TSMC, Samsung, [[Intel]], [[Micron]] |

## For theses

- [[Long WFE]] — core holding, most diversified
- Foundry-agnostic: benefits regardless of TSMC vs Samsung outcome
