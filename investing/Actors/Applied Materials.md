# Applied Materials (AMAT)

Largest semiconductor equipment company by revenue. Broadest portfolio across WFE segments.

---

## Core thesis

Applied Materials is the most diversified WFE play. Exposure across deposition, etch, implant, and inspection. Benefits from any fab buildout regardless of memory vs logic mix.

---

## What they do

| Segment | Description | Position |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Deposition (CVD, PVD) | Deposits thin films | Leader |
| Etch | Removes material | Strong (\#2 to Lam) |
| Ion implant | Dopes silicon with impurities | Leader |
| CMP | Chemical-mechanical polishing | Strong |
| Inspection | Process control | Growing |

Broadest portfolio = most diversified exposure.

## Exposure

| End market | Exposure | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Logic/Foundry | ~55% | TSMC, Samsung, [[Intel]] |
| Memory | ~30% | DRAM, NAND, [[HBM]] |
| Services | ~15% | Installed base support |

More balanced than Lam (memory-heavy) or ASML (logic-heavy).

## Customer concentration (FY25)

| Customer | FY25 growth | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| [[TSMC]] | +80% y/y | ATH, ~40% of foundry/logic revenue |
| [[Samsung]] | +31% y/y | Recovery |
| [[China]] | -16% y/y | [[Export controls]] impact |

TSMC is the dominant driver — leading edge GAA ramp.

## GAA opportunity

GAA (gate-all-around) is the transistor architecture for 2nm and beyond, replacing FinFET.

- **FY25 GAA revenue**: $4.5B (mostly TSMC)
- **AMAT GAA share**: 50%+ of GAA and backside power SAM
- **Incremental revenue**: +30% per fab vs FinFET
- **Runway**: GAA capacity to triple from current levels

This is a structural tailwind — more complex transistors = more AMAT tools per fab.

---

## Key advantages

- **Scale**: Largest WFE company, most R&D spending
- **Breadth**: Sells into every fab, every process
- **Services**: Large installed base = recurring revenue
- **[[China]]**: Significant exposure (risk and opportunity)

---

## [[China]] exposure / risk

- Meaningful revenue from [[China]] (trailing edge)
- [[Export controls]] limit advanced tool sales
- Domestic [[China]] push could pressure pricing
- Risk: further restrictions reduce TAM

## Q1 FY2026 Earnings (Feb 12, 2026)

Fiscal quarter ended January 25, 2026. Beat EPS estimates, stock initially dipped ~3% after-hours then recovered +12%.

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | Q1 FY2025 | YoY |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Revenue | $7.01B | $7.15B | -2% |
| GAAP GM | 49.0% | 48.8% | +20bps |
| GAAP operating margin | 26.1% | 30.4% | -430bps |
| GAAP EPS | $2.54 | $1.45 | +75% |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $2.38 | $2.41 | -1% |
| Cash from ops | $1.69B | — | — |
| Non-GAAP free cash flow | $1.04B | — | +91% YoY |
| Capital returned | $702M | — | ($337M buybacks, $365M dividends) |

**Key highlights:**
- **Record DRAM revenue** in Semiconductor Systems segment
- **Record services and spares revenue** in Applied Global Services
- [[HBM]] demand visibility "through multiple quarters" — patterning, dielectric, advanced packaging, TSV
- Advanced packaging called "strong growth vector" — hybrid bonding, wafer-level packaging
- [[China]]: mixed — mature nodes steady, leading-edge restricted by [[export controls]]
- Book-to-bill around unity, backlog remains elevated
- No material order cancellations; some timing shifts described as typical
- **Q2 FY2026 guide: $7.65B ± $500M revenue, non-GAAP EPS $2.64 ± $0.20** — implies acceleration

**Revenue dip context:** The -2% YoY is against a tough comp (Q1 FY2025 was $7.15B). Sequential +3% from Q4 FY2025. Guidance for Q2 at $7.65B midpoint would be a meaningful step-up.

**"Sell the news" pattern:** StockTitan flagged that AMAT has declined after each of its last 5 earnings beats. This time may be different — stock up 12% post-release.
