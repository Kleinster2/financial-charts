|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Automotive | -$59M | -$432M | -$1.2B+ |
| Software & services | $179M | $576M | $7M |

Software & services growth driven by [[Volkswagen]] JV (vehicle electrical architecture and software development services), plus increased remarketing and repair/maintenance revenue. The VW JV transformed Rivian's financial profile — $576M software gross profit vs $7M a year ago.

Automotive revenue decline driven by delivery drop (-18% YoY) after federal EV tax credit ended, plus higher mix of lower-revenue EDV deliveries and $270M decline in regulatory credit sales.

## 2025 full-year performance

Demand waned for aging R1 platform. R2 critical for growth. First annual gross profit achieved — driven entirely by software/VW JV economics.

---

## [[Volkswagen]] JV (10-K details)

50/50 JV established Nov 2024. Rivian is primary beneficiary (consolidated). Focus: electrical architecture, software, ECUs, network architecture.

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|
| JV revenue from VW | $73M | **$836M** |
| Deferred VW revenue | $1,526M | $1,794M |
| JV assets | ~$250M | ~$800M |

VW funding received: $1,295M (IP license) + $750M equity ($14.56/share) + $250M milestone. **Up to $2.5B more expected** — $1.5B in equity/convertible debt + $1.0B committed term loan (available Oct 2026).

**Mind Robotics JV (Nov 2025):** Rivian 53.5%, [[Eclipse Ventures]] + others 46.5%. Industrial AI and robotics. Third parties contributed ~$112M, Rivian ~$128M (cash + IP). Consolidated as VIE.

## Amazon partnership

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original deal | 100,000 EDVs |
| 2025 revenue from Amazon | $900M |
| Exclusivity | Ended Oct 2023 |
| Status | Can now sell to other fleets |

Amazon ~20% owner of Rivian. [[Chase Bank]] represented ~36% of new EV revenues in 2025 via leasing arrangements.

## R2 launch (2026)

The bull case:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Starting price | ~$45,000 |
| vs R1 price | ~50% cheaper |
| Build cost | ~50% lower material cost than R1 |
| R2 capacity (Normal) | 155,000/year |
| Total Normal capacity | 215,000/year (all platforms) |
| First customer deliveries | Q2 2026 |
| Full unveil / pricing | March 12 (SXSW) |

First R2 manufacturing validation builds completed mid-January 2026 using production tools and processes at Normal, IL plant. New 1.6M sq ft logistics park with direct tunnel connector to reduce dock-to-line lead times.

**Stanton Springs North (Georgia):** Second MSP plant. 400K/year capacity in two phases of 200K. Vertical construction 2026, production 2028. Supported by ~$6.0B DOE ATVM loan ($3.4B Note A + $2.6B Note B) and $1.5B Georgia incentive package.

R2 expected to be "majority of volume" by end of 2027 (Scaringe). R2 + R3 could nearly triple Rivian's addressable market.

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Aging R1 lineup | Demand declining |
| Cash burn | Still losing money |
| Competition | Tesla, legacy OEMs |
| Supply chain | Persistent bottlenecks |
| Scale | Only 42K deliveries vs Tesla 1.6M |

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- R2 transforms economics (~$45K price point, ~50% lower build cost)
- First annual gross profit ($144M in 2025) — VW JV monetizing software IP
- $1.56B software revenue growing 222% YoY — recurring, high-margin
- Amazon partnership (fleet + investment)
- $6.59B liquidity runway
- 2026 delivery guidance 62-67K (+47-59%) — street was at ~63K
- Brand strength in adventure/outdoor segment

Bear:
- Still losing $3.6B/year — adj pre-tax loss guide -$1.8 to -$2.1B for 2026
- Automotive segment gross profit still negative (-$432M FY25)
- Deliveries fell 18% in 2025 (R1 aging, tax credit expiration)
- R2 execution risk (ramp, quality, demand)
- Tesla price cuts pressure margins
- Regulatory credit revenue declining ($270M drop)
- Competition from legacy OEMs entering EV market
