# Lam Research (LRCX)

U.S. semiconductor equipment company specializing in deposition and etch.

---

## Core thesis

Lam benefits from increasing process complexity at advanced nodes. More deposition and etch steps per wafer = more Lam tools. Memory exposure ([[HBM]] buildout) adds cyclical upside.

## What they do

| Segment | Description | Share |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Deposition | Deposits thin films on wafers | Leading |
| Etch | Removes material to create structures | Leading |
| Clean | Wafer cleaning between steps | Strong |

These steps multiply with node complexity — more layers, more steps, more tools.

## Financial targets (Dec 2025)

| Metric | CY2024 | CY2028 [[Target]] | $1T Semi [[Target]] |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $16.2B | $25-27B | $30B+ |
| Gross margin | 48.2% | ~50% | 50%+ |
| Operating margin | 30.6% | 34-35% | 35%+ |
| EPS | $3.36 | $6-7 | $8+ |

7-10% CAGR to 2028. Conservative guidance, likely to beat.

## Exposure

| End market | Exposure | Driver |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Memory | High | [[HBM]] buildout, DRAM/NAND capacity |
| Logic/Foundry | Growing | TSMC, Samsung, [[Intel]] expansion |

Memory cyclicality is a risk but [[HBM]] demand provides structural tailwind.
