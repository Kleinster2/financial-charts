# Lam Research (LRCX)

U.S. semiconductor equipment company specializing in deposition and etch.

---

## Core thesis

Lam benefits from increasing process complexity at advanced nodes. More deposition and etch steps per wafer = more Lam tools. Memory exposure ([[HBM]] buildout) adds cyclical upside.

## What they do

| Segment | Description | Share |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Deposition | Deposits thin films on wafers | Leading |
| Etch | Removes material to create structures | Leading |
| Clean | Wafer cleaning between steps | Strong |

These steps multiply with node complexity — more layers, more steps, more tools.

### Product portfolio detail

**Building Up (Deposition):**
- **ALTUS** — CVD/ALD for tungsten and molybdenum contacts/wires. ALD Moly tools leading the W→Mo transition (3× metallization SAM per wafer). Only company with ALD Moly in production in foundry/logic
- **SABRE** — Electrochemical deposition for copper interconnects + advanced packaging. 6,000 installed plating cells (largest base in industry). SABRE 3D critical for [[HBM]] stacking
- **SPEED, VECTOR, Striker** — Dielectric (insulating) layer deposition

**Carving Down (Etch):**
- **Flex, Vantex** — Dielectric etch. Vantex with cryogenic tech for high-aspect-ratio 3D NAND (200+ layers). Won key multi-generation decision at major NAND customer
- **Kiyo, Versys Metal** — Conductor etch. Akara (new) with plasma pulsing for DRAM — multiple wins at top DRAM maker
- **Syndion** — Deep silicon etch for CMOS image sensors and TSVs

**Keeping it Clean:**
- **Coronus** — Plasma bevel clean
- **DV-Prime, Da Vinci, EOS, SP Series** — Wet clean systems

### Revenue segments

| Segment | Q2 FY26 | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| Systems | ~$3.44B | New equipment (cyclical, +58% YoY in Q2) |
| Customer Support (CSBG) | ~$1.73B | Spares, services, upgrades (recurring, record) |

**CSBG flywheel:** Installed base → recurring spares/service revenue → captive upgrade market (3 consecutive record quarters) → data feeds back to R&D → better next-gen tools → more installed base. This is the stickiness moat.

## FY2025 actuals

| Metric | FY2025 | YoY |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Revenue | **$18.44B** | +23.7% |
| Gross margin | **>50%** | Record (first time since Novellus merger) |
| Free cash flow | **~$5.4B** | Record |
| Deferred revenue | **$2.7B** | Record backlog |
| R&D spend | >$2B | Annual |

## Financial targets (Dec 2025)

| Metric | CY2024 | CY2028 [[Target]] | $1T Semi [[Target]] |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $16.2B | $25-27B | $30B+ |
| Gross margin | 48.2% | ~50% | 50%+ |
| Operating margin | 30.6% | 34-35% | 35%+ |
| EPS | $3.36 | $6-7 | $8+ |

7-10% CAGR to 2028. Conservative guidance, likely to beat.

## Exposure

| End market | Q2 FY26 systems share | Driver |
|------------|----------------------|--------|
| Foundry | 52% | TSMC, advanced logic nodes |
| Memory (NAND + DRAM) | 41% | [[HBM]] buildout, 3D NAND layer count |
| Logic/Other | 7% | — |

| Geography | Revenue share |
|-----------|--------------|
| [[China]] | **35%** |
| Korea | 22% |
| Taiwan | 19% |
| Japan | 14% |
| US | 6% |
| Europe | 2% |

Memory cyclicality is a risk but [[HBM]] demand provides structural tailwind. SAM expanding to mid-30s% of total WFE in 2025 as etch/deposition intensity rises with 3D scaling.

### The "Complexity is Cash Flow" moat

As chips go vertical (200+ layer 3D NAND, GAA transistors, HBM stacks), the number of deposition and etch steps grows non-linearly. Lam's market can expand even if total WFE is flat. GAA transition triples metallization steps per wafer. Advanced packaging share expected to jump ~5pp in CY2025. Management goal: **win >50% of incremental SAM** at each technology inflection.

## Q2 FY2026 earnings (Jan 28, 2026)

**Beat estimates on AI-driven foundry demand.**

| Metric | Q2 FY26 | vs Estimate | YoY |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Revenue | **$5.34B** | Beat ($5.34B) | +27.7% |
| EPS (adj) | **$1.27** | Beat ($1.19) | — |
| Gross margin | **50.6%** | — | — |

**Q3 FY26 guidance:**
- Revenue: $5.25B
- EPS: $1.17

**China risk:**
- "50% affiliate rule" restricts shipments to certain domestic Chinese customers
- Estimated ~$600M revenue impact for full CY2026

**Analyst reaction:** Stock +7% pre-earnings on Evercore upgrade. Zacks Rank \#1 (Strong Buy).

**Outlook:** Management projects robust WFE investment growth in 2026, driven by AI infrastructure demand.

## Zacks top AI stock (Feb 2026)

Ranked #4 on Zacks "Best AI Stocks to Buy" list (updated Feb 16, 2026):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $240.09 |
| Forward P/E | 44.81 |
| 12-week price change | +55.1% |
| Proj EPS growth (1Y) | +27.0% |
| Proj sales growth (1Y) | +20.0% |

Etch/deposition demand rising with advanced packaging and HBM. Solid growth at reasonable semi-equipment P/E.

**Zacks detail:** Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Value F, Growth C, Momentum D. Market cap $294B. Last Q EPS growth +0.8%, last EPS surprise +8.6%. Next earnings: **April 22, 2026**. Advanced packaging momentum driven by AI — foundry-logic integration + next-gen HBM architectures. Management expects advanced packaging to outpace broader WFE growth. Vertical scaling as structural driver — each new node expands opportunity. Strong installed base expansion and share gains.

## Management

| Executive | Role | Background |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **Tim Archer** | CEO (since 2018) | ~20 years at Novellus → Lam COO post-merger (2012). 84/100 approval (top 5% for company size) |
| **Doug Bettinger** | CFO (since 2013) | 11 years at [[Intel]] (manufacturing + finance), then CFO at Avago/[[Broadcom]]. Total Debt/EBITDA just 0.74× |
| **Dr. Patrick Lord** | COO | PhD MIT Mechanical Engineering. Novellus veteran. Led CSBG and Global Operations |

Leadership stability is itself a competitive weapon — semi equipment R&D cycles span 5-10 years. Long tenure builds customer trust for multi-billion, multi-decade fab roadmap partnerships.

## Valuation context (mid-2025)

| Metric | LRCX | [[ASML]] | [[Applied Materials]] | [[KLA]] | TEL |
|--------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| Forward P/E | ~26-28× | ~30×+ | ~21× | ~29-30× | ~high teens-20× |

Mid-pack vs peers. 10-year revenue CAGR ~12% through cycles. Bear case (Morgan Stanley, Underweight, $92 target): NAND + China fade by 2026, ~27× NTM looks full. Bull case: secular AI tailwind + rising SAM share = double-digit EPS growth compresses multiple quickly.

Stock beta: 1.87 (significantly more volatile than market).
