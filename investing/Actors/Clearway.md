## Why Clearway matters

Clearway is a pure-play contracted renewables yieldco:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity | ~9 GW |
| Technologies | Wind, solar, storage, gas |
| Contracts | Long-term PPAs |
| Sponsor | GIP ([[Global Infrastructure Partners]]) |

---

## Asset mix

| Technology | Capacity |
|------------|----------|
| Wind | ~5 GW |
| Solar | ~2.5 GW |
| Storage | Growing |
| [[Natural gas]] | ~2.5 GW (thermal) |

**Note:** [[Natural gas]] provides stable cash flow, but [[ESG]] concern for some.

## Yieldco model

**How it works:**
1. Sponsor (GIP) develops/acquires assets
2. Drops down to Clearway at completion
3. Clearway operates, collects contracted revenue
4. Distributes cash to shareholders

**Benefit:** Predictable cash flows from long-term contracts.
