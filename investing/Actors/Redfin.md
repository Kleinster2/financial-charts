Discount brokerage with technology platform. Key differentiator: **employed agents** (salary + bonus) vs industry norm of independent contractors on pure commission.

| Real Estate Services | $643M | 63% |
| Rentals | $204M | 20% |

## Rocket acquisition (July 2025)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Announced | March 9, 2025 |
| Closed | July 1, 2025 |
| Structure | All-stock merger |
| Combined ownership | Rocket shareholders ~95%, Redfin ~5% |
| Synergy thesis | Rocket mortgage + Redfin brokerage = integrated home buying |

**Why it matters:** Rocket becomes only major mortgage company with integrated brokerage, competing against [[Zillow]]'s media model and [[Compass]]'s agent recruitment model.

## Rentals deal with Zillow

In 2025, [[Zillow]] signed $100M deal for exclusive syndication of Redfin's rental listings. Revenue source independent of brokerage volatility.

---

## Competitive legacy

**What made Redfin different:**
- Discount model challenged 6% total commission norm
- Most-visited brokerage website
- Employed agent model (quality control, training)
- Technology integration (virtual tours, instant offers)

**What didn't work:**
- Chronic losses despite scale
- iBuying experiment failed (like [[Zillow]])
- Couldn't break commission wall profitably

---

## Investment implications

No longer separately investable. For Rocket exposure:
- Redfin adds brokerage vertical to mortgage leader
- Cross-sell potential: mortgage customers → Redfin agents
- Integration execution risk
