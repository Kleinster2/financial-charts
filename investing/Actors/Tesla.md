Tesla — EV maker, but increasingly an AI/compute company. Dojo chips, FSD, potential [[Samsung]] anchor customer. \#2 to BYD in global EV sales (2025).

World's most valuable automaker with ~$97.7B FY2025 revenue (flat YoY, first annual decline on record) and 1.63M deliveries (-8.5% YoY). Pivoting from pure EV play to AI/compute: FSD hit 1.1M active subscriptions, robotaxi production targeted for April 2026, and capex guidance >$20B for 2026 (more than doubling). Invested $2B in Musk's xAI, now a SpaceX subsidiary post-merger. The bull case: FSD monetization inflection, Optimus humanoid robots, Tesla Energy expansion, and AI training infrastructure create optionality far beyond auto. The bear case: Evercore forecasts a $5-7B FCF deficit in 2026 as capex doubles, core auto margins compressed by EV price war, Musk attention split across SpaceX/xAI/DOGE, and BYD overtaking globally.

## Q4 2025 earnings (Jan 28, 2026)

Beat estimates, stock +3% afterhours to $445

| Metric | Q4 2025 | vs Est |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $24.9B | Beat |
| EPS (adj) | $0.50 | Beat |
| Deliveries | 418K | Miss (423K est) |
| FSD subscribers | 1.1M | +38% YoY |

Full year 2025:
- Revenue: ~$97.7B (first annual decline on record)
- Profit: -46% YoY
- Deliveries: 1.63M (-8.5% YoY)

Key announcements:
- Investing $2B in [[xAI]] (Musk's AI company)
- FSD active subscriptions hit 1.1M milestone
- Robotaxi production on track for April 2026
- Capex guidance: >$20B for 2026 (more than doubling)

## 2026 cash flow crisis (Evercore forecast)

Wall Street bracing for FCF deficit:

![[tsla-fcf-evercore.png]]
*Evercore sees $5-7B cash flow deficit in 2026 — a potential $13B swing from 2022 peak.*

| Metric | 2025 | 2026E | Swing |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Free cash flow | ~$6B | -$5 to -$7B | -$11-13B |
| Capex | ~$10B | >$20B | +$10B+ |
| Cash on hand | $44B | Declining | — |

*Source: Bloomberg, Evercore ISI (Jan 2026)*

Drivers:
- Capex more than doubling for EV ramp, battery plants, robots
- $2B committed to [[xAI]]
- AI infrastructure for FSD training and [[Tesla Optimus]] "brain"
- [[Tesla Energy]] expansion (Houston 50 GWh Megablock plant)

The xAI entanglement (post-merger Feb 2026):
- Tesla's $2B xAI investment now in SpaceX subsidiary
- [[xAI]] burning ~$1B/month (now funded by SpaceX)
- Tesla sold $430M in [[Megapack]]s to xAI in 2024
- Grok integration in Tesla vehicles
- xAI to power Optimus humanoid robots
- Fiduciary concerns: Tesla excluded from [[SpaceX xAI merger]] but subsidized xAI

Musk ownership math: 11% Tesla, 42% [[SpaceX]], 51% [[xAI]] — merger would increase his combined stake significantly

$1T pay package implications:
- Tesla shareholders approved blockbuster pay package (2024)
- Milestones would be adjusted for any merger per agreement terms
- SpaceX in fold = additional growth avenues to hit targets
- Bloomberg Intel view: SpaceX-xAI merger (without Tesla) may avoid distraction from pay package milestones

Retail shareholder angle:
- Tesla's devoted retail base could shape merger reception
- @TeslaBoomerMama (220K followers): merger would "give retail shareholders in the only public company... the right to participate in the other two"
- Many retail investors already view Tesla/SpaceX/xAI as one ecosystem

Risk: Tesla excluded from SpaceX/xAI mega-deal while providing $2B capital. See [[SpaceX xAI merger]].

## Memory fab consideration (Feb 2026)

Musk declared Tesla may build its own memory fabrication plant due to the [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|global DRAM shortage]]. Quote (late Jan 2026): "We've got two choices: hit the chip wall or make a fab." Tesla among a dozen major corporations signaling that DRAM shortage will constrain production in 2026.

---

## Custom silicon

- Dojo: Custom AI training chip for FSD (Full Self-Driving)
- FSD chip: Inference chip in vehicles
- Designed in-house

---

## Foundry relationship

- Dojo reportedly fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Potential [[Samsung]] customer — Musk (Tesla + [[xAI]]) could anchor Samsung Taylor fab
- AI5 chip delayed to mid-2027

## FSD / Robotaxi (2026 narrative)

Current status (Jan 2026):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Austin robotaxi launch | June 2025 |
| Robotaxis in service | ~135 |
| Safety driver | Still required (human in passenger seat) |
| Unsupervised testing | Started Dec 2025 (Austin) |

Cybercab:
- Production starts April 2026 (Giga Texas)
- No steering wheel or pedals
- "Less than 10-second cycle time" (Musk)
- Regulatory approval timing uncertain

FSD expansion:
- [[Europe]] demo rides ongoing
- Supervised FSD [[Europe]] launch Q1 2026 (target)
- Still requires constant driver attention

Challenges:
- Unsupervised FSD not approved yet
- Early incidents: wrong-side driving, phantom braking
- Federal regulator scrutiny
- AI5 chip delayed → Cybercab may launch on AI4 hardware

Bull thesis: Robotaxi = $5T+ market opportunity if Tesla solves autonomy
Bear thesis: Perpetually "next year" — FSD promised since 2016

### California Autopilot ruling (Feb 2026)

California DMV ruled (Dec 2025) that Tesla's use of "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" branding was misleading and violated state law. Judge found Tesla's naming followed "a long but unlawful tradition of intentionally using ambiguity to mislead consumers."

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original penalty | 30-day suspension of manufacturer + dealer licenses |
| Final outcome | Suspension stayed; 60 days to stop using "Autopilot" |
| Tesla response | Removed "Autopilot" branding in California (Feb 2026) |
| Broader action | Discontinued Autopilot nationwide in Jan 2026 |
| FSD change | Moved to subscription-only ($99/mo), eliminated $8,000 purchase option |

California is Tesla's largest US market. The subscription pivot (coinciding with compliance deadline Feb 14) reframes FSD as recurring revenue — forces driver engagement and may boost adoption vs one-time purchase barrier.

## Energy / Megapack

[[Tesla Energy]] = fastest growing, most profitable division:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|
| Storage deployed | 31.4 GWh | 46.7 GWh |
| Revenue | $10.1B | ~$12.75B |
| Gross margin | ~26% | 31.4% |
| % of Tesla profit | — | 23% (vs 13% of revenue) |

Manufacturing capacity:
- Lathrop, CA: 40 GWh/year
- Shanghai: 40 GWh/year
- Houston (2026): 50 GWh/year (Megablock)
- Total: ~133 GWh/year when Houston operational

Bull case: Energy could surpass automotive revenue by 2029. Some project $200B+ by 2030.

## Solar cell manufacturing push (Feb 2026)

[[Elon Musk]] announced 100 GW/year solar cell production target for [[Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] combined — to power data centers on Earth and in space. Active site evaluations underway:

| Location | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Buffalo, NY (existing) | Expansion to 10 GW capacity |
| Second NY facility | Under consideration |
| Arizona | Under consideration |
| Idaho | Under consideration |

Led by VP Bonne Eggleston (hiring for domestic solar manufacturing). Musk on podcast: current US solar import tariffs are "gigantic" — "We are going to make solar."

Context: US produces only ~3 GW of solar cells annually (BloombergNEF). Most domestic manufacturing is panels, not cells — cells are dominated by [[China]]. Tesla/SpaceX teams recently visited Chinese solar companies to inquire about manufacturing equipment.

[[First Solar]] (current US leader) expects 14 GW US capacity in 2026. Tesla's 100 GW target would dwarf all US production combined. First Solar stock fell ~7% on the news.

Previous solar efforts: 2016 SolarCity acquisition (~$2B) failed to scale beyond niche Solar Roof product. This pivot is industrial-scale cell manufacturing, not residential.

## [[Automotive]] exposure

Major consumer of automotive semiconductors:
- SiC (silicon carbide) for power
- MCUs, sensors, connectivity

STMicro SiC weakness partly attributed to Tesla inventory correction.

---

## Rare earth exposure

EV motors require permanent magnets with rare earth elements:

| Element | Use | [[China]] control |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Neodymium | Permanent magnets | ~90% |
| [[Dysprosium]] | High-temp stability | ~99% |

Risk: [[China]]'s 2025 rare earth controls directly threaten Tesla's supply chain. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

Mitigation attempts:
- Reducing rare earth content per motor
- Exploring alternative motor designs
- Giga Shanghai = potential local sourcing advantage

---

## EV market headwinds (2026)

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| BYD overtook Tesla (2025) | \#2 globally now |
| US market contracting | -29% forecast (1.1M units) |
| Trump ended tax incentives | $7,500 credit gone |
| [[China]] competition | BYD, [[Xiaomi]], others pricing down |
| [[Europe]] collapsing | See Jan 2026 data below |

US EV market: 1.5M (2025) → 1.1M (2026 forecast)

### Europe sales collapse (Jan 2026)

| Market | Jan 2026 sales | YoY change |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| France | 661 units | -42% |
| Norway | — | -88% |

France sales lowest in 3+ years. Norway historically Tesla's strongest European market.

Drivers:
- Musk political backlash (DOGE, Trump administration role)
- Chinese EV competition ([[BYD]], [[Xiaomi]] entering)
- End of subsidies in multiple countries
- Brand damage from US political polarization

## 4680 battery program struggles

L&F contract collapse (Jan 2026):

| Metric | Original | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Contract value | $2.9B | $7,386 |
| Change | — | -99.9997% |

South Korean cathode supplier [[L&F]] reduced its Tesla contract from $2.9B to effectively zero due to "change in supply quantity."

4680 status:
- Only used in Cybertruck (20-25K units/year vs 250K Giga Texas capacity)
- Promised $25K EV dependent on 4680 cost savings — no timeline
- Competitors ([[BMW]], Rivian) adopting 46XX format independently

Implications: In-house battery strategy appears to have failed. Tesla may need to rely on external suppliers (CATL, Panasonic) for future vehicles, compressing margins.

---

## For theses

[[Short Tesla]]: 4680 failure, FSD delays, valuation disconnect, FCF deficit
[[AI capex arms race]]: Tesla as cash source for Musk's AI ambitions
[[Short TSMC long Korea]]: If Tesla/xAI anchor Samsung, bullish Korea
[[Automotive semiconductors]]: Major EV maker, demand signal for auto semis
[[Long TSMC]]: Dojo currently TSMC

## 2025 delivery decline

Full year 2025: first annual decline

| Metric | 2025 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Deliveries | 1.64M | 1.79M | -8.6% |
| Production | 1.65M | 1.77M | -7% |

Q4 2025 specifically:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Deliveries | 418,227 | 495,570 | -16% |
| vs expectations | Miss (426K expected) | — | — |

Causes:
- Boycotts tied to Musk's political views
- Competition from lower-cost Chinese EVs
- US market contraction (Trump ended $7,500 credit)

## Analyst sentiment (Jan 2026)

Consensus: Hold (32 analysts)

| Rating | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Buy | 13 |
| Hold | 10 |
| Sell | 9 |

Mean price target: $393.90 (implies ~10% downside from $438)

| Analyst | Rating | [[Target]] | View |
|---------|--------|--------|------|
| Wedbush (Ives) | Outperform | $600 | AI/autonomy upside |
| [[Morgan Stanley]] | Hold | $425 | Limited near-term upside |
| [[Truist]] | Hold | $439 | Cautious on valuation |

---

## Investment thesis

Bull case:
- Robotaxi/FSD = $5T+ TAM if solved
- Energy business growing 50%+ annually, 31% margins
- Optimus humanoid robot optionality
- AI compute (Dojo) differentiator
- Musk political influence (DOGE, Trump access)
- Brand loyalty despite headwinds

Bear case:
- 100x+ P/E on declining deliveries
- FSD perpetually "next year" since 2016
- BYD, Chinese EVs winning on cost
- US EV market contracting (-29% forecast)
- Musk distraction (xAI, SpaceX, DOGE, X)
- Boycotts from political polarization
- Analyst mean target implies downside

## Short interest history (quarterly)

Note: Tesla historically has HIGH short interest and is squeeze-prone — different pattern from other Mag 7.

| Quarter | SI % float | Stock | Note |
|---------|------------|-------|------|
| Q1 2026 | 2.7% | $438 | Highest Mag 7, rose from 71M to 78M shares |
| Q4 2025 | 2.5% | $— | |
| Q3 2025 | — | $— | |
| Q2 2025 | — | $— | |
| 2020-21 | 15-20%+ | $— | Historic squeeze era |

Pattern: Still highest SI in Mag 7, but far below squeeze-era levels. Some bears remain but not crowded.

See [[Short interest]] for interpretation framework.
