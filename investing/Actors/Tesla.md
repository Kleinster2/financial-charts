**Tesla** — EV maker, but increasingly an AI/compute company. Dojo chips, FSD, potential [[Samsung]] anchor customer. **#2 to BYD in global EV sales (2025).**

---

## Relevance to semis

Tesla is both an automotive semiconductor consumer and a custom AI chip designer.

---

## Custom silicon

- **Dojo**: Custom AI training chip for FSD (Full Self-Driving)
- **FSD chip**: Inference chip in vehicles
- Designed in-house

---

## Foundry relationship

- Dojo reportedly fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Potential [[Samsung]] customer — Musk (Tesla + [[xAI]]) could anchor Samsung Taylor fab

---

## Automotive exposure

Major consumer of automotive semiconductors:
- SiC (silicon carbide) for power
- MCUs, sensors, connectivity

STMicro SiC weakness partly attributed to Tesla inventory correction.

---

## Rare earth exposure

EV motors require permanent magnets with rare earth elements:

| Element | Use | China control |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Neodymium | Permanent magnets | ~90% |
| Dysprosium | High-temp stability | ~99% |

**Risk**: China's 2025 rare earth controls directly threaten Tesla's supply chain. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Mitigation attempts**:
- Reducing rare earth content per motor
- Exploring alternative motor designs
- Giga Shanghai = potential local sourcing advantage

## EV market headwinds (2026)

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **BYD overtook Tesla (2025)** | #2 globally now |
| US market contracting | -29% forecast (1.1M units) |
| Trump ended tax incentives | $7,500 credit gone |
| China competition | BYD, [[Xiaomi]], others pricing down |
| Europe slowing | +14% vs prior 20%+ growth |

**US EV market:** 1.5M (2025) → 1.1M (2026 forecast)

---

## For theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: If Tesla/xAI anchor Samsung, bullish Korea
**[[Automotive semiconductors]]**: Major EV maker, demand signal for auto semis
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Dojo currently TSMC
