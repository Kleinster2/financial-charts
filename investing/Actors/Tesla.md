**Tesla** — EV maker, but increasingly an AI/compute company. Dojo chips, FSD, potential [[Samsung]] anchor customer.

---

## Relevance to semis

Tesla is both an automotive semiconductor consumer and a custom AI chip designer.

---

## Custom silicon

- **Dojo**: Custom AI training chip for FSD (Full Self-Driving)
- **FSD chip**: Inference chip in vehicles
- Designed in-house

---

## Foundry relationship

- Dojo reportedly fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Potential [[Samsung]] customer — Musk (Tesla + [[xAI]]) could anchor Samsung Taylor fab

---

## Automotive exposure

Major consumer of automotive semiconductors:
- SiC (silicon carbide) for power
- MCUs, sensors, connectivity

STMicro SiC weakness partly attributed to Tesla inventory correction.

## For theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: If Tesla/xAI anchor Samsung, bullish Korea
**[[Automotive semiconductors]]**: Largest EV maker, demand signal for auto semis
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Dojo currently TSMC
