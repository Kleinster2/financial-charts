**Tesla** — EV maker, but increasingly an AI/compute company. Dojo chips, FSD, potential [[Samsung]] anchor customer. **#2 to BYD in global EV sales (2025).**

---

## Relevance to semis

Tesla is both an automotive semiconductor consumer and a custom AI chip designer.

---

## Custom silicon

- **Dojo**: Custom AI training chip for FSD (Full Self-Driving)
- **FSD chip**: Inference chip in vehicles
- Designed in-house

---

## Foundry relationship

- Dojo reportedly fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Potential [[Samsung]] customer — Musk (Tesla + [[xAI]]) could anchor Samsung Taylor fab
- AI5 chip delayed to mid-2027

## FSD / Robotaxi (2026 narrative)

**Current status (Jan 2026):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Austin robotaxi launch | June 2025 |
| Robotaxis in service | ~135 |
| Safety driver | Still required (human in passenger seat) |
| Unsupervised testing | Started Dec 2025 (Austin) |

**Cybercab:**
- Production starts **April 2026** (Giga Texas)
- No steering wheel or pedals
- "Less than 10-second cycle time" (Musk)
- Regulatory approval timing uncertain

**FSD expansion:**
- Europe demo rides ongoing
- Supervised FSD Europe launch Q1 2026 (target)
- Still requires constant driver attention

**Challenges:**
- Unsupervised FSD not approved yet
- Early incidents: wrong-side driving, phantom braking
- Federal regulator scrutiny
- AI5 chip delayed → Cybercab may launch on AI4 hardware

**Bull thesis:** Robotaxi = $5T+ market opportunity if Tesla solves autonomy
**Bear thesis:** Perpetually "next year" — FSD promised since 2016

## Energy / Megapack

**Tesla Energy = fastest growing, most profitable division:**

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|
| Storage deployed | 31.4 GWh | **46.7 GWh** |
| Revenue | $10.1B | ~$12.75B |
| Gross margin | ~26% | **31.4%** |
| % of Tesla profit | — | **23%** (vs 13% of revenue) |

**Manufacturing capacity:**
- Lathrop, CA: 40 GWh/year
- Shanghai: 40 GWh/year
- Houston (2026): 50 GWh/year (Megablock)
- **Total: ~133 GWh/year** when Houston operational

**Bull case:** Energy could surpass automotive revenue by 2029. Some project $200B+ by 2030.

---

## Automotive exposure

Major consumer of automotive semiconductors:
- SiC (silicon carbide) for power
- MCUs, sensors, connectivity

STMicro SiC weakness partly attributed to Tesla inventory correction.

---

## Rare earth exposure

EV motors require permanent magnets with rare earth elements:

| Element | Use | China control |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Neodymium | Permanent magnets | ~90% |
| Dysprosium | High-temp stability | ~99% |

**Risk**: China's 2025 rare earth controls directly threaten Tesla's supply chain. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Mitigation attempts**:
- Reducing rare earth content per motor
- Exploring alternative motor designs
- Giga Shanghai = potential local sourcing advantage

---

## EV market headwinds (2026)

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **BYD overtook Tesla (2025)** | #2 globally now |
| US market contracting | -29% forecast (1.1M units) |
| Trump ended tax incentives | $7,500 credit gone |
| China competition | BYD, [[Xiaomi]], others pricing down |
| Europe slowing | +14% vs prior 20%+ growth |

**US EV market:** 1.5M (2025) → 1.1M (2026 forecast)

---

## 4680 battery program struggles

**L&F contract collapse (Jan 2026):**

| Metric | Original | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Contract value | $2.9B | $7,386 |
| Change | — | **-99.9997%** |

South Korean cathode supplier [[L&F]] reduced its Tesla contract from $2.9B to effectively zero due to "change in supply quantity."

**4680 status:**
- Only used in Cybertruck (20-25K units/year vs 250K Giga Texas capacity)
- Promised $25K EV dependent on 4680 cost savings — no timeline
- Competitors (BMW, Rivian) adopting 46XX format independently

**Implications:** In-house battery strategy appears to have failed. Tesla may need to rely on external suppliers (CATL, Panasonic) for future vehicles, compressing margins.

---

## For theses

**[[Short Tesla]]**: 4680 failure, FSD delays, valuation disconnect
**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: If Tesla/xAI anchor Samsung, bullish Korea
**[[Automotive semiconductors]]**: Major EV maker, demand signal for auto semis
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Dojo currently TSMC

## 2025 delivery decline

**Full year 2025: first annual decline**

| Metric | 2025 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Deliveries | 1.64M | 1.79M | -8.6% |
| Production | 1.65M | 1.77M | -7% |

**Q4 2025 specifically:**

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Deliveries | 418,227 | 495,570 | -16% |
| vs expectations | Miss (426K expected) | — | — |

**Causes:**
- Boycotts tied to Musk's political views
- Competition from lower-cost Chinese EVs
- US market contraction (Trump ended $7,500 credit)

## Analyst sentiment (Jan 2026)

**Consensus: Hold** (32 analysts)

| Rating | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Buy | 13 |
| Hold | 10 |
| Sell | 9 |

**Mean price target: $393.90** (implies ~10% downside from $438)

| Analyst | Rating | Target | View |
|---------|--------|--------|------|
| Wedbush (Ives) | Outperform | $600 | AI/autonomy upside |
| Morgan Stanley | Hold | $425 | Limited near-term upside |
| Truist | Hold | $439 | Cautious on valuation |

**Investor focus shifting:** From deliveries → FSD/robotaxi execution in 2026.

---

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- Robotaxi/FSD = $5T+ TAM if solved
- Energy business growing 50%+ annually, 31% margins
- Optimus humanoid robot optionality
- AI compute (Dojo) differentiator
- Musk political influence (DOGE, Trump access)
- Brand loyalty despite headwinds

**Bear case:**
- 100x+ P/E on declining deliveries
- FSD perpetually "next year" since 2016
- BYD, Chinese EVs winning on cost
- US EV market contracting (-29% forecast)
- Musk distraction (xAI, SpaceX, DOGE, X)
- Boycotts from political polarization
- Analyst mean target implies downside

## Short interest history (quarterly)

**Note:** Tesla historically has HIGH short interest and is squeeze-prone — different pattern from other Mag 7.

| Quarter | SI % float | Stock | Note |
|---------|------------|-------|------|
| **Q1 2026** | **2.7%** | $438 | Highest Mag 7, rose from 71M to 78M shares |
| Q4 2025 | 2.5% | $— | |
| Q3 2025 | — | $— | |
| Q2 2025 | — | $— | |
| 2020-21 | **15-20%+** | $— | Historic squeeze era |

**Pattern:** Still highest SI in Mag 7, but far below squeeze-era levels. Some bears remain but not crowded.

See [[Short interest]] for interpretation framework.
