## Investment relevance

- One of the fastest AI companies to $50M ARR — 5 months
- Super Bowl ad buy (2x airings at ~$8M each = ~$16M) is aggressive for a Series B company — signals either confidence or pre-IPO brand-building
- Multi-model routing approach — not locked to any single foundation model provider
- Competes in crowded AI productivity space against [[Microsoft]] Copilot, [[Google]] Workspace AI, [[OpenAI]] ChatGPT Enterprise
