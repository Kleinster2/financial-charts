|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Amazon]] |
| Acquired | 2020 for $1.2B |
| Approach | Purpose-built robotaxi |

## Amazon acquisition

**$1.2B deal (2020):**
- Amazon's AV entry
- Kept independent
- Continued development
- Last-mile delivery angle?

---

## Purpose-built vehicle

**No steering wheel:**
- Bidirectional design
- 4-passenger pod
- No driver seat
- Built for autonomy

Different from retrofitted cars.
