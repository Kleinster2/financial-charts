## Netflix Acquisition (Dec 2025 – present)

| Acquirer | [[Netflix]] |

| Announced | Dec 5, 2025 |
| Senate hearing | Feb 3, 2026 — [[Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing 2026-02-03|full notes]] |

**Deal structure:**
- Netflix acquires **studios + HBO/HBO Max** (Warner Bros. entity)
- **Discovery Global** spins off separately (CNN, TBS, HGTV, TNT Sports, Discovery)
- Board unanimously chose Netflix over Paramount Skydance ($108B hostile bid) and one other unnamed bidder
- Still evaluating competing offers per Delaware law

**Key arguments (from Campbell testimony):**
- Primarily vertical merger — Netflix distribution + WB production
- 80% of HBO Max subs already subscribe to Netflix (complementary, not competing)
- HBO Max positioned as premium "add-on," not anchor service
- Netflix's reach gives WB content global audience
- Netflix's financial backing (investment-grade, predictable cash flow)

**Regulatory risks:**
- DOJ, EU, state AGs all reviewing
- Market definition is the key question
- Trump involvement as political wild card

## Paramount hostile competing bid (Feb 2026)

[[Paramount Global]] (post-Skydance) launched a **hostile $30/share all-cash bid for all of WBD** — enterprise value ~$108.4B. This competes with [[Netflix]]'s $27.75/share offer for studios + HBO only.

- **$30 vs $27.75** — Paramount offering ~9% more than current trading price (~$27.57)
- **Feb 10:** Paramount added **25¢/share quarterly ticking fee** if not closed by Dec 31, 2026
- WBD board advised shareholders to **take no action**
- Activist **Ancora** pushing board to formally engage with Paramount
- Senate antitrust hearing held Feb 3; DOJ review ongoing for both bids

The Paramount bid is for the *entire* company (including CNN, Discovery networks, TNT Sports), while Netflix's bid carves out only studios/HBO. Paramount's offer is richer but faces greater antitrust hurdles.
