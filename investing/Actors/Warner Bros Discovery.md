## Acquisition by Paramount (resolved Feb 26, 2026)

Bidding war between [[Netflix]] and [[Paramount Global]] ended Feb 26 when the board declared Paramount's $31/share bid a "Superior Proposal." Netflix declined to match its $27.75 offer.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Winning bidder | [[Paramount Global]] ([[Skydance Media]]) |
| Price | $31/share all-cash (entire company) |
| Enterprise value | ~$77B |
| Netflix bid (withdrawn) | $27.75/share for studios + HBO only (~$83B) |
| Netflix breakup fee | $2.8B |
| Shareholder vote | March 20, 2026 |
| Financial backstop | [[Larry Ellison]] $40B personal equity guarantee |

Unlike Netflix's carve-out (studios + HBO only, with Discovery Global spinning off), Paramount is acquiring the entire company — including CNN, TBS, HGTV, TNT Sports, and Discovery networks.

Open risks: Paramount financing complexity ($1.5B junior lien fee), debt load, [[Larry Ellison]] equity guarantee certainty, activist opposition at March 20 vote.

## Corporate restructuring

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Internal split | Warner Bros vs Discovery Global (originally planned) |
| Netflix carve-out | Collapsed Feb 26 — Netflix walked away |
| Paramount full acquisition | $31/share for entire company — vote March 20 |

Under the Netflix deal, Discovery Global (CNN, TBS, HGTV, TNT Sports) would have spun off separately. Under Paramount's deal, the entire company is acquired — the future of [[Linear TV]] assets remains an open question.

## Debt situation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q3 2025 debt paydown | $1.2B |
| Focus | Deleveraging |
| Challenge | Linear decline |

## Charts

![[wbd-price-chart.png]]
*WBD since Apr 2022 (post-merger listing) — cratered from $24 to $7 on write-downs and linear decline, then spiked to $29 on acquisition bids (Dec 2025). Trading at $28.80, ~7% below the $31 deal price*

![[wbd-fundamentals-chart.png]]
*Revenue tripled on WarnerMedia merger (2022) but massive goodwill write-downs drove net income deeply negative. The pre-2022 data reflects Discovery Inc. standalone*

## Financials

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Op. Income | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| 2019 | $11.1B | $2.1B | $3.0B | Discovery Inc. standalone |
| 2020 | $10.7B | $1.2B | $2.5B | COVID impact |
| 2021 | $12.2B | $1.0B | $2.0B | Last year pre-merger |
| 2022 | $33.8B | -$7.4B | -$7.4B | WarnerMedia merger; massive goodwill impairment |
| 2023 | $41.3B | -$3.1B | -$1.5B | Continued write-downs |
| 2024 | $39.3B | -$11.3B | -$10.0B | Further impairments; linear decline |

Revenue stepped up 3x with the WarnerMedia merger (Apr 2022) but the combined entity has been writing down goodwill relentlessly — $30B+ in cumulative impairments since the merger. The company has never reported positive net income as a combined entity.

## Leadership

| Person | Role | Since |
|--------|------|-------|
| David Zaslav | CEO | 2022 (merger) |
| Gunnar Wiedenfels | CFO | 2022 (merger) |
| Bruce Campbell | CRO/CSO | 2022 |

David Zaslav came from Discovery; the WarnerMedia side was AT&T-controlled before the spinoff-merger.

## Evolution

- 1985 — Discovery Communications founded; grew into reality/documentary empire (Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, HGTV, Food Network via Scripps 2018 acquisition)
- 2018 — Discovery acquires Scripps Networks ($14.6B) — added HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel
- Apr 2022 — [[AT&T]] spins off WarnerMedia, merges with Discovery to form Warner Bros Discovery. AT&T had acquired TimeWarner for $85B in 2018; the spinoff effectively reversed that deal after massive debt accumulation
- 2022-2024 — $30B+ in goodwill write-downs as the legacy media model deteriorated faster than expected. [[Linear TV]] ad revenue declined 17%. Stock cratered from $24 to $7
- 2023-2024 — Max [[Streaming]] service reached 117M subscribers and turned profitable ($1.3B estimated for 2025), but couldn't offset linear decline
- Oct 2025 — Board began evaluating strategic alternatives (sale, spinoff, separation of studios from linear). Stock surged 24% on the news
- Dec 2025 — [[Netflix]] bid $27.75/share for studios + HBO; [[Paramount Global]] countered with $31 for entire company. Board chose Paramount Feb 26, 2026

## Investment case

Bull:
- Paramount deal at $31/share — premium to pre-deal trading
- Max reaching scale (117M subs)
- Streaming profitable
- Valuable content library
- DC universe potential

Bear:
- Paramount deal execution risk (financing, integration)
- [[Linear TV]] networks declining (-17% ad revenue)
- Heavy debt load
- [[Cord-cutting]] accelerating
- March 20 vote — activist opposition possible
