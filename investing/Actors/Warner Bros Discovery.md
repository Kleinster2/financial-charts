| Announced | Dec 5, 2025 |
| Senate hearing | Feb 3, 2026 — [[Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing 2026-02-03|full notes]] |

**Deal structure:**
- Netflix acquires **studios + HBO/HBO Max** (Warner Bros. entity)
- **Discovery Global** spins off separately (CNN, TBS, HGTV, TNT Sports, Discovery)
- Board unanimously chose Netflix over Paramount Skydance ($108B hostile bid) and one other unnamed bidder
- Still evaluating competing offers per Delaware law

**Key arguments (from Campbell testimony):**
- Primarily vertical merger — Netflix distribution + WB production
- 80% of HBO Max subs already subscribe to Netflix (complementary, not competing)
- HBO Max positioned as premium "add-on," not anchor service
- Netflix's reach gives WB content global audience
- Netflix's financial backing (investment-grade, predictable cash flow)

**Regulatory risks:**
- DOJ, EU, state AGs all reviewing
- Market definition is the key question
- Trump involvement as political wild card
