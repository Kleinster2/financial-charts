| Announced | Dec 5, 2025 |
| Senate hearing | Feb 3, 2026 — [[Netflix-WB Senate Antitrust Hearing 2026-02-03|full notes]] |

**Deal structure:**

- **Discovery Global** spins off separately (CNN, TBS, HGTV, TNT Sports, Discovery)
- Board unanimously chose Netflix over Paramount Skydance ($108B hostile bid) and one other unnamed bidder
- Still evaluating competing offers per Delaware law

**Key arguments (from Campbell testimony):**
- Primarily vertical merger — Netflix distribution + WB production
- 80% of HBO Max subs already subscribe to Netflix (complementary, not competing)
- HBO Max positioned as premium "add-on," not anchor service
- Netflix's reach gives WB content global audience
- Netflix's financial backing (investment-grade, predictable cash flow)

**Regulatory risks:**
- DOJ, EU, state AGs all reviewing
- Market definition is the key question
- Trump involvement as political wild card

## Paramount hostile competing bid (Feb 2026)

[[Paramount Global]] (post-Skydance) launched a **hostile $30/share all-cash bid for all of WBD** — enterprise value ~$108.4B. This competes with [[Netflix]]'s $27.75/share offer for studios + HBO only.

- **$30 vs $27.75** — Paramount offering ~9% more than current trading price (~$27.57)
- **Feb 10:** Paramount added **25¢/share quarterly ticking fee** if not closed by Dec 31, 2026
- WBD board advised shareholders to **take no action**
- Activist **Ancora** pushing board to formally engage with Paramount
- Senate antitrust hearing held Feb 3; DOJ review ongoing for both bids

The Paramount bid is for the *entire* company (including CNN, Discovery networks, TNT Sports), while Netflix's bid carves out only studios/HBO. Paramount's offer is richer but faces greater antitrust hurdles.

### Feb 17 — WBD rejects $30, opens 7-day window for "best and final"

WBD board rejected Paramount's $30/share bid but gave a **7-day window (until Feb 23)** for a "best and final offer" — first time the board has formally engaged with Paramount after rejecting six prior offers. Key details:

- Paramount verbally floated **$31/share** (not a formal offer), which enticed the board to the table
- WBD board: "We have not determined that your proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger"
- WBD secured a **special waiver from Netflix** to negotiate with Paramount — legal loophole under the merger agreement
- **Shareholder vote on Netflix deal set for March 20**
- **Discovery Global spinoff** valued at $1.33–$6.86/share (WBD estimate)

**Unresolved issues in Paramount bid:**
- Who covers potential $1.5B junior lien financing fee
- What happens if debt financing falls through
- Whether [[Larry Ellison]]'s $40B personal equity guarantee is fully certain
- $2.8B breakup fee to Netflix if WBD walks

**Activist pressure:**
- [[Ancora Holdings]] (~$200M stake) plans to oppose the Netflix deal, argues board hasn't adequately engaged with Paramount
- [[Pentwater Capital]] (~50M WBD shares) backs Paramount; CEO Matt Halbower eyed as potential WBD board nominee

**Market reaction (Feb 17):** Paramount +6%, WBD +2.3%, Netflix -1.4%.

### Feb 20 — Paramount clears HSR antitrust hurdle; WBD staff shift toward Netflix

**Paramount clears DOJ/HSR waiting period (Feb 20):**
- Paramount announced the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired after responding to DOJ's second request — "no statutory impediment in the U.S. to closing"
- **But no deal exists to close** — Paramount filed HSR preemptively without a signed agreement
- Netflix CLO David Hyman pushed back: "Routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval... they are a long way from doing so"
- Netflix still responding to its own DOJ second request (will trigger separate 30-day waiting period)
- Paramount's CLO is **Makan Delrahim**, former Trump DOJ Antitrust Division chief — notable regulatory connection

**WBD employee sentiment shifts to Netflix (Variety, Feb 20):**
- Most WBD staffers now favor Netflix deal over Paramount takeover
- Netflix co-CEOs Sarandos/Peters won people over with assurances + vision for combined company
- Remaining skepticism centers on theatrical distribution — Netflix promised 45-day exhibition window
- "Some familiarity with the idea" of becoming part of Netflix has set in

**Countdown: Feb 23 deadline is Monday** — Paramount must submit "best and final" offer. Key question: will they go above $31/share (the verbal number that got them to the table)?

**Next catalyst: March 20 shareholder vote on Netflix merger.**
