## Why Toyota matters

Toyota is the world's largest auto chip buyer:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Auto chips | Largest buyer of MCUs, power semis |
| Rapidus | Investor in [[Japan]] fab consortium |
| Woven City | AI/autonomous testbed |
| Autonomous | Conservative approach |

---

## Semiconductor demand

**Major auto chip customer:**

| Chip type | Suppliers |
|-----------|-----------|
| MCUs | Renesas, [[NXP]], [[Infineon]] |
| Power semis | Infineon, [[STMicro]], ON Semi |
| [[Image sensors]] | [[Sony]], ON Semi |
| ADAS | Mobileye, NVIDIA, custom |

Toyota demand = significant portion of automotive semiconductor market.

## Rapidus investment

**[[Japan]] semiconductor revival:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | Minority stake |
| Goal | 2nm logic in [[Japan]] by 2027 |
| Partners | [[Sony]], [[NTT]], others |
| Tech source | [[IBM]] research partnership |

Toyota supporting [[Japan]]'s effort to rebuild domestic chip manufacturing.

## Woven City

**AI/autonomous testbed (Susono, [[Japan]]):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Under construction |
| Purpose | Living lab for mobility/AI |
| Population | 2,000 residents (target) |
| Tech | [[Autonomous vehicles]], AI, robotics |

Subsidiary: Woven by Toyota (formerly Toyota Research Institute)

## Autonomous driving strategy

**Conservative approach:**

| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Woven City | Controlled testbed |
| Guardian | Driver assist (not full autonomy) |
| Chauffeur | Full autonomy (longer-term) |
| Partners | [[Aurora]] (investment) |

Toyota skeptical of premature full autonomy. Focusing on assist features first.

**Contrast with [[Tesla]]:** Tesla pushing FSD aggressively; Toyota more cautious.

## EV / powertrain strategy

**Multi-path approach:**

| Powertrain | Toyota stance |
|------------|---------------|
| Hybrids | Market leader (Prius, RAV4) |
| BEV | Behind competitors, catching up |
| Hydrogen | Mirai, fuel cell trucks |
| Solid-state | R&D, 2027+ production target |

**Bet on solid-state batteries:** Toyota claims breakthrough, production planned 2027+.

## Chip supply chain lessons

**2021 shortage response:**

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Inventory buildup | Increased chip inventory targets |
| Direct relationships | More engagement with chip suppliers |
| Dual sourcing | Reducing single-vendor risk |

Toyota was better prepared than some competitors due to inventory practices.

## Q4 FY2025 earnings (Feb 6, 2026)

**Beat on both lines, CEO transition announced.**

| Metric | Actual | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Operating income | ¥1.2T ($7.6B) | Below YoY but beat |
| Revenue | ¥13.4T ($85B) | ¥12.8T ($81B) |

**CEO change:** CFO [[Kenta Kon]] becomes CEO and president in April 2026, replacing [[Koji Sato]]. Sato remains vice chairman.

**Management commentary:** "Despite the continued impact of US tariffs, strong demand supported by product competitiveness has led to increased sales volumes, and we achieved a high level of profit due to price revisions."

Stock +2% on results.
