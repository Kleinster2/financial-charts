## Factor investing philosophy

AQR pioneered systematic factor investing.

### Core factors

| Factor | Description | Status (2025) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Value** | Buy cheap, sell expensive | Lagging |
| **Momentum** | Buy winners, sell losers | Strong |
| **Quality** | Buy profitable, stable companies | Strong |
| **Low risk** | Buy low-volatility stocks | Strong |
| **Carry** | Capture yield differentials | — |

### Academic foundation

- Asness PhD thesis with Eugene Fama (momentum)
- Published extensively on factor premia
- AQR shares research publicly
- "Academic hedge fund" reputation

## Investment approach

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Style | Systematic, rules-based |
| Research | Academic-quality, published |
| Transparency | Explains methodology (unusual for hedge funds) |
| Diversification | Across factors, geographies, asset classes |
| Fees | Lower than typical hedge funds |

**Contrast to Renaissance**: RenTech is secretive; AQR is transparent. Both are quant.

---

## Three quant crises

Asness has navigated three major drawdowns:

| Crisis | Period | Cause |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Quant meltdown** | Aug 2007 | Factor crowding; rapid deleveraging |
| **Value crash** | 2018-2020 | Growth/momentum dominated; value collapsed |
| **Post-COVID** | 2020-2022 | Meme stocks, low rates hurt factors |

Each time AQR stuck to its process and eventually recovered.

## Comparison to peers

| Fund | Style | 2024 | 2025 | AUM |
|------|-------|------|------|-----|
| **AQR** | Factor quant | +15% Apex | +19.6% Apex | $166B |
| [[Two Sigma]] | ML quant | +14.3% AR | +14.3% AR | $110B |
| [[Renaissance Technologies]] | Pure quant | — | — | $130B |
| [[D.E. Shaw]] | Hybrid | +18% Comp | +18.5% Comp | $65B |

## Investment relevance

**Why track AQR**:

1. **Factor bellwether** — When AQR struggles, value/momentum are out of favor. When AQR thrives, factors are working.

2. **Asness as signal** — His public commentary (Twitter, papers) signals quant sentiment and factor outlook.

3. **AUM recovery** — $95B → $166B shows institutional confidence returning to factors.

4. **Academic legitimacy** — Fama student; published research. Bridge between academia and practice.

5. **Lower fees** — Offers factor exposure cheaper than alternatives.
