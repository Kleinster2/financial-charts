## Business model

**Bundled with Microsoft 365** — no standalone revenue breakout. Key driver of enterprise 365 adoption.

| Plan | Includes Teams |
|------|---------------|
| Microsoft 365 Business | Yes |
| Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Yes |
| Teams Essentials | $4/user/mo standalone |

[[EU]] unbundling: Microsoft now offers Office 365 without Teams in [[EU]] due to antitrust.

## Competitive position

| vs | Teams advantage | Teams weakness |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| [[Slack]] | Bundling, enterprise lock-in | Less loved by developers |
| [[Zoom]] | Integrated, no extra cost | Video quality perception |
| [[Google Chat]] | Microsoft ecosystem | [[Google]] Workspace shops |

Bundling is existential threat to Slack.
