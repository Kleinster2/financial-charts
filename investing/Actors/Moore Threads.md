## [[Barclays]] view (Jan 2026)

> "[[China]] is catching up very quickly in the chip war. It wouldn't surprise me if in 2026 or 2027 we have a **[[DeepSeek]] moment for chips** where a low-cost competitive chip is being produced by [[China]]. This would be disruptive for Nvidia and their supply chain."
