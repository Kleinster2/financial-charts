## Why Moore Threads matters

Leading [[China]] GPU challenger, founded by NVIDIA veteran:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founder | James Zhang (ex-NVIDIA VP, 14 years) |
| IPO | Dec 2025, +400% on debut |
| Market cap | 312B yuan (~$43B) |
| Platform | MUSA (CUDA alternative) |
| Status | Unprofitable |

## Founding story

**James Zhang Jianzhong:**
- 14 years at NVIDIA
- VP and [[GM]] of [[China]] operations
- Left 2020 to found Moore Threads
- Brought NVIDIA know-how to [[China]]

---

## [[Consumer]] GPU history

**MTT S80 (2022) — first Chinese consumer gaming card:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Milestone | First domestic gaming GPU with PCIe 5.0 |
| Result | Historic but struggled |
| Issues | Immature drivers, inconsistent performance |
| Modern games | Failed to run smoothly |

Paved the way for [[Lisuan]] G100 (Dec 2025).

## Product roadmap

**Huagang architecture (5th gen, announced MDC 2025):**

| Product | Type | Claims |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Huashan** | AI training/inference | Between Hopper and Blackwell |
| **Lushan** | [[Gaming]] GPU | 15x perf, 50x ray tracing vs prior |

**Key features:**
- MTLink interconnect (100k+ GPU scaling)
- MUSA software platform
- DirectX 12 Ultimate support (gaming)

---

## MUSA platform

**[[Meta]]-computing Unified System Architecture:**
- [[China]]'s CUDA alternative
- Proprietary software stack
- Ecosystem building
- Developer tools

**Challenge:** CUDA has 15+ years head start, massive ecosystem.

## Financial status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IPO price | 114.28 yuan |
| First day close | 600.5 yuan (+425%) |
| Market cap | 312B yuan (~$43B) |
| Revenue | Growing |
| Profit | Net loss 724M yuan (9mo 2025) |

Massive valuation despite losses — [[China]] policy premium.

## Manufacturing

**Foundry situation:**
- Uses domestic fabs (likely [[SMIC]])
- Limited to mature nodes
- Can't access [[TSMC]] advanced
- Export controls constrain

## Four Little Dragons

Moore Threads is one of [[China]]'s "Four Little Dragons" of GPUs:

| Company | Founder background | Status |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Moore Threads** | Ex-NVIDIA | IPO'd, +400% |
| [[Biren Tech]] | Ex-NVIDIA/[[Alibaba]] | IPO Jan 2026 |
| [[MetaX]] | Ex-[[AMD]] | IPO'd, +693% |
| [[Enflame]] | Ex-[[AMD]] | IPO prep |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[China]] GPU localization mandate
- NVIDIA blocked = captive market
- Ex-NVIDIA founder credibility
- Government backing
- First mover in [[China]] GPU

**Bear:**
- Massive losses
- Technology gap vs NVIDIA
- MUSA ecosystem nascent
- Manufacturing constraints
- Valuation stretched

## [[Barclays]] view (Jan 2026)

> "[[China]] is catching up very quickly in the chip war. It wouldn't surprise me if in 2026 or 2027 we have a **[[DeepSeek]] moment for chips** where a low-cost competitive chip is being produced by [[China]]. This would be disruptive for Nvidia and their supply chain."
> — Matt Toms, Head of Cash Equity Execution [[Asia]]-Pacific, [[Barclays]]
