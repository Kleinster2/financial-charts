## Insights

- **Full faith and credit** — Only MBS with explicit US government guarantee. [[Fannie Mae]]/[[Freddie Mac]] have implicit (now explicit post-conservatorship) backing.
- **Enables government lending** — Without Ginnie Mae, FHA/VA/USDA loans would have no secondary market. Lenders couldn't recycle capital.
- **No credit risk to taxpayers (in theory)** — FHA/VA already insure/guarantee the loans. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment to MBS investors.

## How it works

```
Borrower → FHA/VA insured loan → Lender → Pool into Ginnie Mae MBS → Investors
                                              ↓
                              Ginnie Mae guarantees timely P&I
```

1. Borrower gets FHA/VA/USDA loan
2. FHA/VA/USDA insures/guarantees the loan against default
3. Lender pools loans into Ginnie Mae MBS
4. **Ginnie Mae guarantees** timely principal and interest to MBS investors
5. If borrower defaults → FHA/VA pays lender → lender pays MBS investor

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — government entity.

**Ginnie Mae MBS are investable:**
- Explicit government guarantee = lowest credit risk
- Higher yield than Treasuries
- Prepayment risk (like all MBS)
- Used by [[Mortgage REITs]], banks, insurers, pension funds

**Signals to watch:**
- FHA/VA loan volume trends
- Government housing policy shifts
- Prepayment speeds (rates drive this)
