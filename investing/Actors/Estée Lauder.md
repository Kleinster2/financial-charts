# Estée Lauder

**World's #2 prestige beauty company** — owns Estée Lauder, Clinique, MAC, La Mer, Tom [[Ford]] Beauty, Jo Malone, Aveda. In crisis: revenue down to $14.3B in FY25 (-8%), stock lost ~$100B from peak, dividend cut, outlook withdrawn. Root cause: ~30% exposure to China + [[Asia]] travel retail, which collapsed. Losing US market share to [[L'Oréal]].

## The China/travel retail problem

| Metric | Value |

| China + [[Asia]] travel retail | **~30% of revenue** |
| APAC revenue (FY24) | $4.89B (-16% from 2021 peak) |
| China luxury market (2024) | -18-20% (Bain & Co) |
| [[Japan]] manufacturing | $1B facility (2018) — now underutilized |

**What happened:**
- ELC bet heavily on Chinese demand and [[Asia]] travel retail (Hainan duty-free, Korean travel retail)
- Post-COVID China luxury boom reversed sharply in 2024
- [[Travel]] retail inventory destocking compounded the decline
- [[Japan]] factory built for China demand now has overcapacity

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stock at ~$25B for company with $14B+ revenue
- Prestige beauty is structurally growing (fragrance, skincare)
- Portfolio includes La Mer, Tom [[Ford]], Jo Malone = genuine luxury
- China will eventually recover
- New CEO can reset expectations
- Lauder family alignment (long-term holders)

**Bear:**
- China/[[Asia]] may not recover to prior levels
- Losing US share to L'Oréal
- Several brands (MAC, Clinique, Too Faced) in decline
- Family control limits strategic options (no sale)
- [[Travel]] retail structural shift (Hainan less relevant)
- Dividend cut signals severity of problems
