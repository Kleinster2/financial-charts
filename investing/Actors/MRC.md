# MRC

The Media Rating Council is a U.S. industry body that accredits media measurement services. Founded in 1964 at the recommendation of Congress following concerns about the accuracy of broadcast ratings. MRC accreditation is the gold standard for measurement services -- without it, buyers and sellers lack confidence in the data used to transact billions in advertising.

Central to [[Nielsen]]'s business: MRC suspended Nielsen's national TV ratings accreditation in September 2021 over COVID undercounting, reinstated April 2023. MRC again reviewed [[Nielsen]]'s Big Data + Panel accreditation in October 2025.
