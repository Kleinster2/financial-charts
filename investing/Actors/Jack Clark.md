## Notable essays

### Agent ecologies (Feb 2, 2026)

On [[Moltbook]] — called it a "Wright Brothers demo" for agent ecologies:

> "Large swathes of the internet will feel like walking into a room with a hundred thousand aliens deep in conversation in languages you don't understand."

Key thesis: Humans will need "translation agents" to navigate agent-dominated spaces. Risk: those emissaries may be "swayed by the alien conversations they will be having with their true peers."

### AI R&D automation

On automated AI research creating "strategic surprise" — if AI R&D closes the loop, organizations could accelerate 100-1000x faster than competitors. "AI R&D may be the single most existentially important technology development on the planet."
