**TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority)** — Federal utility. Powers xAI Colossus. Government-owned = unique advantages.

## Why TVA matters

TVA is xAI's power source — and a model for AI infrastructure siting:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Type | Federal corporation (government-owned) |
| Territory | Tennessee + parts of 6 states |
| Capacity | ~30 GW |
| Key customer | [[xAI]] Colossus |

## xAI Colossus

**Why xAI chose Tennessee:**
- TVA has available power capacity
- Lower cost than coastal utilities
- Faster interconnection than grid-constrained areas
- Government entity = cooperative

**Colossus facilities:**
| Facility | Location | Power |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Colossus 1 | Memphis | TVA power |
| Colossus 2 | Tennessee | 400MW → 2GW |

TVA is the enabler of Musk's AI infrastructure.

## Government advantage

**Unlike private utilities:**
- Non-profit (lower cost)
- Mission-driven
- Federal backing
- Easier permitting (federal land)
- Can move faster

**For AI buildout:**
- TVA can prioritize AI customers
- Less regulatory friction
- Available capacity
- Attractive rates

## Power mix

| Source | Share |
|--------|-------|
| Nuclear | ~40% (largest in US) |
| Natural gas | ~25% |
| Hydro | ~10% |
| Coal | Declining |
| Solar | Growing |

**Nuclear fleet:** Largest in US — Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, Watts Bar.

## Data center recruitment

TVA actively recruiting data centers:
- Available power (unlike Dominion)
- Competitive rates
- Nuclear baseload (clean)
- Federal support

**Beyond xAI:**
- Google has Tennessee presence
- Other hyperscalers looking
- Tennessee becoming AI hub

---

## Unique structure

**Federal corporation:**
- Created 1933 (New Deal)
- Government-owned, self-funded
- Board appointed by President
- Not publicly traded
- Bonds are quasi-government

**Cannot invest directly** — no stock. But TVA bonds exist.

---

## Investment implications

**Indirect plays:**
- Companies siting in TVA territory
- [[xAI]] (private)
- Tennessee real estate
- Construction/engineering firms

**TVA itself:**
- Not investable (government)
- But signals where AI infra goes
- Power availability = site selection
