Kering's full acquisition postponed to 2028+ as brand weakens. Alessandro Michele (ex-Gucci) appointed creative director March 2024.

**Valuation trajectory:** $300M (1998) → $210M (2002, written down) → €700M (2012) → €5.7B (2023) → likely impaired (2025).

## Historical financials

| Year | Revenue (€M) | Growth | EBITDA (€M) | EBITDA % | Notes |

## Ownership saga

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2012 | Mayhoola acquires Valentino |
| Jul 2023 | Kering buys 30% for €1.7B, option for remaining 70% |
| Sep 2025 | Kering and Mayhoola announce ownership won't change before 2028 |
| Nov 2025 | €100M capital injection (Kering + Mayhoola) after covenant breach |
| 2028-2029 | Mayhoola put options (deferred from 2026-2027) |

**Why the delay:** Valentino is tracking double-digit revenue declines in 2025, making the put option exercise unfavorable for Mayhoola and the full acquisition unattractive for Kering. The €100M injection came after Valentino breached bank covenants on its €530M loan.

## Put/call option structure

| Term | Original (Jul 2023) | Amended (Sep 2025) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Mayhoola put** | Exercisable 2026-2027 | **Postponed to 2028-2029** |
| **Kering call** | Exercisable 2028 | **Postponed to 2029** |
| **Pricing basis** | EBITDA multiple | Unchanged |
| **Estimated 70% price** | ~€4B (at €5.7B EV) | "Substantially below" €4B |
| **Other terms** | — | Unchanged |

**The math problem:** Kering paid €1.7B for 30% in July 2023, implying €5.7B enterprise value. At that valuation, acquiring the remaining 70% would cost ~€4B. But with EBITDA collapsing from €337M (2022) to €246M (2024) — a 27% decline — the EBITDA-based formula now points to a much lower price.

**Kering's public stance:** CFO Armelle Poulou stated in November 2024 that any acquisition price would be "substantially below" the €4B implied by the original deal, given Valentino's deteriorating performance.

**Strategic implications:**
- **For Mayhoola:** Exercising puts in 2028-29 at depressed EBITDA means accepting a loss vs. their €700M (2012) investment aspirations
- **For Kering:** Even at a lower price, acquiring a declining €1.3B brand adds to their €10.5B net debt pile
- **For both:** The postponement buys time for Alessandro Michele's turnaround to (hopefully) lift EBITDA before option exercise

## Financial distress signals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue trend | -3% (2024), double-digit decline (2025E) |
| EBITDA decline | -22% (2024) |
| Covenant breach | Triggered €100M injection |
| Wholesale cut | -20% in 2024, continuing in 2025 |
| Kering net debt | €200M (2021) → €10.5B (2024) — limits firepower |

## Creative leadership

| Director | Tenure | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Valentino Garavani | 1960-2008 | Founder, defined the house |
| Pierpaolo Piccioli | 2016-2024 | Critical acclaim, elevated brand |
| **Alessandro Michele** | 2024-present | Ex-Gucci, maximalist aesthetic |

**The Michele bet:** After transforming Gucci (2015-2022), Michele's maximalist vision is being applied to Valentino. But his later Gucci years saw brand fatigue — can he reinvent without repeating?

---

## Strategic challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Identity crisis** | Caught between couture heritage and commercial relevance |
| **Wholesale reduction** | Cutting -20% to protect brand, but hurts revenue |
| **Ownership limbo** | Neither fully Mayhoola nor Kering — strategic paralysis |
| **Debt burden** | ~€1B with declining EBITDA |
| **Kering's own problems** | Parent too leveraged for full acquisition |

---

## Mayhoola portfolio

| Brand | Acquired | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Valentino | 2012 | Declining |
| Balmain | 2016 | Small, niche |
| Pal Zileri | 2014 | Minor |
| Beymen (Turkey) | 2015 | Department stores |

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (private), but critical for:
- [[Kering]] valuation — €1.7B invested, potential €5B+ liability if put options exercised
- Luxury sector health signal — mid-tier luxury under most pressure
- Creative director market — Michele's success/failure affects industry
