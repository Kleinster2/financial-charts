## The pitch

**Marketing claims:**

## The fraud

### 1. Fake AI ("AI-washing")

**Reality:** "Natasha" AI was actually 700+ engineers in Noida and Bangalore manually coding projects.

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| AI builds apps autonomously | Human engineers coded everything |
| "Natasha" AI assistant | Engineers instructed to mimic AI responses |
| No-code platform | Traditional outsourced development |

Wall Street Journal flagged this as early as **2019** — investors ignored warnings.

### 2. Revenue fraud

| Metric | Claimed | Actual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 2024 revenue | $220M | **~$50M** |
| [[Inflation]] factor | — | **4x** |

**Method:** "Roundtripping" scheme with Indian social media company VerSe Innovation to artificially inflate revenue.

### 3. Leadership issues

| Person | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| **[[Sachin Dev Duggal]]** (CEO) | Criminal probes for money laundering, fled to Dubai |
| **Saurabh Dhoot** (co-founder) | Implicated in fraudulent loan scheme |
