## Revenue by segment

| Segment | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 | Q3 2025 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Flash Memory | 32% | 34% | 35% |
| CMS (DRAM) | 24% | 27% | 30% |
| Logic IC ([[Nuvoton Technology]]) | 42% | 37% | 33% |
| Other | 2% | 2% | 2% |

DRAM (CMS) is the fastest-growing segment — rising from 24% to 30% of revenue in three quarters as DDR4 ASPs surge.

**End markets (Q3 2025):** Consumer 30%, Automotive/Industrial 28%, Communication 22%, Computing 20%.

## Products

**NOR Flash:**
- Serial NOR: 512Kb-1Gb, 3V and 1.8V, speeds to 133MHz
- #1 serial NOR supplier since 2012 (by units)
- **TrustME W77Q:** Secure NOR with Common Criteria EAL 2+, industry-first post-quantum cryptography (LMS algorithm). New densities 256Mb-1Gb.

**NAND Flash:**
- SLC NAND (1Gb-8Gb), QspiNAND, OctalNAND
- SpiStack: NOR+NAND multi-chip package (e.g., 64MB NOR + 1Gb NAND)

**Specialty DRAM:**
- DDR1/2/3/4, SDRAM, Mobile DRAM (PSRAM, HyperRAM, LPDDR1-4X)
- DDR4 now the main DRAM product — sales more than doubled QoQ in Q3 2025
- New: 8Gb DDR4 on in-house **16nm process** (launched Dec 2025)

**CUBE Architecture:**
- 3D memory for edge AI computing
- 256Mb-8Gb per die, 3D stackable
- Compatible with CoW, WoW, 2.5D/3D interposer packaging
- Revenue contribution expected late 2026, potentially up to half of CMS sales by 2028

**[[Nuvoton Technology]]:** Spun off from Winbond's Logic IC division in 2008. Acquired [[Panasonic]] semiconductor business in 2020. Consolidated in Winbond's revenue (~33-42%).

## Financials

**Quarterly progression:**

| Metric | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 | Q3 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue (NT$B) | 20.0 | 21.0 | 21.8 |
| Gross margin | 25.6% | 22.7% | 46.7% |
| Net income (NT$B) | -1.1 | -1.3 | +2.9 |
| EPS (NT$) | -0.24 | -0.29 | +0.65 |

Returned to profitability in Q3 2025 after four consecutive quarterly losses. Gross margin nearly doubled from Q2 to Q3.

**Monthly revenue acceleration:**

| Month | Revenue (NT$B) | YoY |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Oct 2025 | 8.2 | +35% |
| Nov 2025 | 8.6 | +39% |
| Dec 2025 | 9.8 | +53% |
| Jan 2026 | 11.8 | **+94%** |

January 2026 was the first month ever above NT$10B. Q4 2025 revenue: NT$26.6B (+22% QoQ).

**2026 outlook:** Revenue target >NT$100B. Analyst consensus NT$134.5B (+53% YoY), EPS NT$7.52.

## DDR4 structural shortage

The same dynamic benefiting [[Nanya Technology]]:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Big Three shifting to [[HBM]] | DDR4 production dropped to ~20% of 2024 levels |
| [[CXMT]] retreating from DDR4 | Less Chinese competition |
| DDR4 prices surging past DDR5 | Pricing inversion benefiting Winbond |
| DRAM contract prices | Expected to double YoY through Q2 2026 |
| 2027 capacity | **Already fully pre-sold** |

No relief expected until 2027 mega-fabs ([[Samsung]] P4L, [[SK Hynix]] M15X) come online. Market shortfall estimated at 10-15% through Q2 2026.

## Kaohsiung fab expansion

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Kaohsiung Science Park (STSP) |
| Site | 25 hectares |
| Total investment | NT$335B+ over build-out |
| Current node | Advancing 25nm → 20nm → **16nm** |
| Initial capacity | ~15,000 wafers/month |
| 2025 capex | NT$5.3B (final equipment) |
| Late 2025 board approval | NT$35.5B ($1.16B) for AI capacity restructuring |

The 16nm DDR4 launched in December 2025 — smaller die, better power efficiency, higher wafer productivity. Mass production shipping 2026.
