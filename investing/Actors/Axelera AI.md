## $250M+ funding round (Feb 24, 2026)

Largest investment ever in a European AI semiconductor company.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round size | $250M+ |
| Lead | Innovation Industries |
| New investors | [[BlackRock]], SiteGround Capital |
| Returning investors | Bitfury, Samsung Catalyst Fund, EU Innovation Council, CDP Venture Capital, SFPIM, Invest-NL |
| Total raised (all-time) | $450M+ (equity + grants + venture debt) |
| Customers | 500+ |
| Sectors | Defense, manufacturing, retail, robotics, security, aerospace, telecom |
