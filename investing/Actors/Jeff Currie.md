**Jeff Currie** — Chief Strategy Officer, Energy Pathways at [[Carlyle]]. Former Global Head of Commodities Research at [[Goldman Sachs]] (1996-2023). The most prominent supercycle bull on Wall Street. Called the 2000s commodity boom, the shale "lower for longer" period, and the current metals supercycle starting late 2020.

## The supercycle thesis — "Revenge of the old economy"

Currie coined "revenge of the old economy" in a 2004 note at [[Goldman Sachs]]. The pattern repeats every cycle: a tech boom (dot-com in 2000, FAANG in 2010s) diverts capital from physical commodities. Supply atrophies. Then demand exposes the shortfall.

**The 2000s version:** The dot-com boom choked off investment in steel, energy, cement. Then 400 million rural Chinese entered the consumer economy and exposed the severity of it. [[Oil]] went from $20 to $140 — seven times.

**The current version:** The FAANG boom drew capital from Exxons for ~10 years. COVID demand surge exposed the underinvestment. But what makes this cycle different is the ESG overlay — it made it structurally harder to get capital into commodities even after prices rose. Policy responses (higher taxes, price controls, redistribution) discouraged long-term investment while doing nothing for supply.

As of January 2026 (Odd Lots podcast, Jan 30): we're still in the "foothills of the Himalayas" for this cycle.

Key demand drivers:
- Electrification and energy transition ([[Copper]], [[Tin]], aluminum)
- AI/datacenter power demand
- Defense spending and geopolitical hoarding
- [[China]] buying across the complex

Key supply constraints:
- Mining capex structurally depressed for a decade
- 12-26 years to bring new [[Copper]] mines online
- ESG/policy headwinds blocking capital allocation to old economy
- Miners prefer M&A over greenfield development

## Copper — "highest-conviction trade ever"

Currie's single highest-conviction call. From Odd Lots (May 2024): "If you go back to the 2000s, I was as bullish on oil then as I am copper today. Oil ended up going up from $20 to $140 — seven times. The upside on copper here is very significant."

Price target: $15,000/t (~$6.80/lb), set mid-2024. [[Copper]] subsequently hit $14,500/t in January 2026.

Three pillars:
1. **Green capex / electrification** — solar, EVs, grid buildout all copper-intensive
2. **AI / data centers** — improved electricity grid depends on [[Copper]]
3. **Military / deglobalization** — rising defense spend, reshoring

Supply side: Thinning inventories, stalled mine output, political/financial challenges in producer countries. Majors prefer M&A over new mine development — no one wants to commit to 15-year greenfield projects.

"Copper is the new oil" — the bottleneck commodity of the energy transition.

## Current views (Feb 2026)

**Metals:** Bullish across the board. [[Gold]] bull market broadening through commodities. [[Silver]] rally driven by [[China]] buying and industrial demand. On Odd Lots (Jan 30, 2026): explained the metals surge and why the supercycle has years to run.

**Oil:** Contrarian bullish. On Bloomberg (Feb 9): oil and metals "substantially underinvested" with significant upside. Dismisses glut narrative — "if you are having to scrape the data to find evidence of the glut, it is not an oil supply glut." Estimates ~100M barrels could reenter if sanctions rolled back, but execution would be difficult.

**Geopolitics:** Rising risks driving hoarding across all commodity classes. Sees rotation from "new economy" to "old economy" assets.

## The New Joule Order (Mar 2025)

Currie's first flagship research at [[Carlyle]]. Core argument: the next energy era is defined by energy security, not climate imperatives.

Key claims:
- Global fossil fuel trade peaked in 2017, declined 5% since — "Peak Oil Trade"
- The world's protector of global trade ([[United States]]) no longer has incentive to protect it (shale revolution made US a net exporter)
- Climate concern is not the main driver — security is. Nations building diversified energy mixes to insulate from geopolitical risk
- The "green premium" has faded; market searching for a "security premium"
- Investors overly fixated on how energy is *produced* (LCOE) at expense of how it is *consumed* (ROE). All consumed energy is the same — it's a joule
- AI is the latest in a century-long linear trend of electrification. "Too big to ignore" but has done little to accelerate demand *growth*
- Fossil fuels and nuclear remain substantially underinvested relative to forward demand

**Critique** (Art Berman): Currie warns trade wars threaten fossil fuels but ignores trade vulnerabilities of renewables — solar panels, batteries, rare earths all depend on [[China]]-dominated supply chains. Not all joules are equal (energy density, intermittency, form factor matter).

## The New Martial Plan (2025)

Sequel to The New Joule Order. The shifting security landscape is driving economies to prioritize defense investment.

Key claim: Incremental direct investment across [[Europe]] in defense and adjacent infrastructure could reach €9T over the next decade.

Private capital's role in rebuilding [[Europe]]'s defense and infrastructure backbone is a core investment theme.
