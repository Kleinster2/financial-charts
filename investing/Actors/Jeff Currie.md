**Jeff Currie** — Chief Strategy Officer, Energy Pathways at [[Carlyle]]. Former Global Head of Commodities Research at [[Goldman Sachs]] (1996-2023). The most prominent supercycle bull on Wall Street. Called the 2000s commodity boom, the shale "lower for longer" period, and the current metals supercycle starting late 2020.

## The supercycle thesis

Currie has been calling for a new commodities supercycle since late 2020, driven by structural underinvestment in supply — a process he calls "the revenge of the old economy." His core argument: decades of capital flowing to tech/new economy starved physical commodity supply, and the bill is coming due.

As of January 2026 (Odd Lots podcast, Jan 30): we're still in the "foothills of the Himalayas" for this cycle. The rally has years to run.

Key drivers:
- Structural underinvestment in mining and energy capex
- Electrification and energy transition demand ([[Copper]], [[Tin]], [[Aluminum]])
- AI/datacenter power demand
- Defense spending and geopolitical hoarding
- [[China]] buying across the complex

## Current views (Feb 2026)

**Metals:** Bullish across the board. [[Copper]] is his "highest-conviction trade ever" — called the move from $5,000 to $14,500. [[Gold]] bull market broadening through commodities. [[Silver]] rally driven by [[China]] buying and industrial demand.

**Oil:** Contrarian bullish. On Bloomberg (Feb 9): oil and metals "substantially underinvested" with significant upside. Dismisses glut narrative — "if you are having to scrape the data to find evidence of the glut, it is not an oil supply glut." Estimates ~100M barrels could reenter the market if sanctions rolled back, but execution would be difficult.

**Geopolitics:** Rising geopolitical risks driving hoarding across all commodity classes. Sees rotation from "new economy" to "old economy" assets. Published "The New Martial Plan" at [[Carlyle]] arguing defense investment could reach €9T across [[Europe]] over the next decade.

**Energy transition:** Published "The New Joule Order" (Mar 2025) arguing next energy era defined by energy security more than climate imperatives — shift from "Peak Oil" to "Peak Trade."
