**Circle** — Issuer of USDC stablecoin. Partner with [[Coinbase]]. Critical infrastructure for crypto and tokenization.

---

## Why Circle matters

Circle issues the second-largest stablecoin:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | CRCL ([[NYSE]]) |
| Product | USDC stablecoin |
| Market cap | ~$30B+ |
| Backing | USD, [[Treasuries]] |
| Partner | [[Coinbase]] (co-creator) |

---

## USDC stablecoin

Dollar on the blockchain:
- 1 USDC = 1 USD (pegged)
- Backed by cash and short-term [[Treasuries]]
- Redeemable for dollars
- Used for trading, DeFi, payments

vs USDT ([[Tether]]):

| Aspect | USDC | USDT |
|--------|------|------|
| Issuer | Circle | [[Tether]] |
| Transparency | High (audited) | Lower |
| Size | \#2 (~$30B) | \#1 (~$120B) |
| Trust | Higher | Questions |

---

## Business model

| Revenue | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Interest income | Earn yield on reserves |
| Enterprise services | APIs, treasury management |
| Cross-border payments | Remittances |

Circle earns interest on USDC reserves ([[Treasuries]]) — higher rates = more revenue.

## Coinbase partnership

Centre Consortium (dissolved 2023):
- Circle and [[Coinbase]] co-created USDC
- [[Coinbase]] earns share of USDC revenue
- Deep integration with [[Coinbase]] exchange
- Circle now sole issuer

---

## Tokenization relevance

Infrastructure for tokenized assets:
- Settlement in USDC
- Stablecoin payments for tokens
- On/off ramp to traditional finance

See [[Tokenized private shares]].

## GENIUS Act Impact (July 2025)

The passage of the [[GENIUS Act]] was the "IPO Unlock" Circle needed:
- Legitimacy: USDC effectively became a US-sanctioned digital dollar format
- Compliance: mandated 100% reserve backing (Circle was already compliant)
- Advantage: puts pressure on non-compliant offshore rivals like [[Tether]] (USDT)
- IPO unlock: Circle IPO'd June 2025 at $31/share, trading as CRCL on [[NYSE]]

---

## IPO (June 2025)

Circle IPO'd in June 2025 at $31/share after the [[GENIUS Act]] passage provided regulatory clarity. The 2022 SPAC deal ($9B target) had fallen through. Trading as CRCL on [[NYSE]].

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Now public (CRCL), liquid
- [[GENIUS Act]] regulatory moat
- Stablecoin market ~$300B and growing
- Interest income scales with USDC growth
- Payments use case expanding

Bear:
- [[Tether]] still dominates
- Interest rate sensitivity (down = less revenue)
- Competition ([[PayPal]] PYUSD, bank stablecoins)
- Regulatory implementation uncertainty ([[GENIUS Act]] requirements due Jul 2026)
