**Circle** — Issuer of USDC stablecoin. Partner with [[Coinbase]]. Critical infrastructure for crypto and tokenization.

---

## Why Circle matters

Circle issues the second-largest stablecoin:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Product | USDC stablecoin |
| Market cap | ~$30B+ |
| Backing | USD, [[Treasuries]] |
| Partner | [[Coinbase]] (co-creator) |

---

## USDC stablecoin

**Dollar on the blockchain:**
- 1 USDC = 1 USD (pegged)
- Backed by cash and short-term [[Treasuries]]
- Redeemable for dollars
- Used for trading, DeFi, payments

**vs USDT (Tether):**
| Aspect | USDC | USDT |
|--------|------|------|
| Issuer | Circle | Tether |
| Transparency | High (audited) | Lower |
| Size | #2 (~$30B) | #1 (~$120B) |
| Trust | Higher | Questions |

## Business model

| Revenue | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Interest income | Earn yield on reserves |
| Enterprise services | APIs, treasury management |
| Cross-border payments | Remittances |

**Key:** Circle earns interest on USDC reserves ([[Treasuries]]) — higher rates = more revenue.

## Coinbase partnership

**Centre Consortium (dissolved 2023):**
- Circle and Coinbase co-created USDC
- Coinbase earns share of USDC revenue
- Deep integration with Coinbase exchange
- Circle now sole issuer

---

## Tokenization relevance

**Infrastructure for tokenized assets:**
- Settlement in USDC
- Stablecoin payments for tokens
- On/off ramp to traditional finance

## GENIUS Act Impact (July 2025)

**The Regulatory Moat:**
The passage of the [[GENIUS Act]] was the "IPO Unlock" Circle needed.
*   **Legitimacy:** USDC effectively became a US-sanctioned digital dollar format.
*   **Compliance:** Mandated 100% reserve backing (Circle was already compliant).
*   **Advantage:** Puts pressure on non-compliant offshore rivals like Tether (USDT).
*   **IPO Status:** S-1 filing likely imminent/active post-passage.

## IPO attempts

**Has tried to go public:**
- SPAC deal (2022) — fell through
- Traditional IPO — still pursuing
- Regulatory clarity needed

---

## Investment case

**Can't invest directly** (private), but:

**Bull:**
- Stablecoin growth secular
- Interest income scales
- Regulatory moat (compliance)
- Payments use case growing
- IPO eventually

**Bear:**
- Private (can't invest)
- Tether dominates
- Regulatory risk
- Competition (PayPal PYUSD)
- Interest rate sensitivity (down = less revenue)
