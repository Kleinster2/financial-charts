## Venezuela exposure

**Rosneft was major player:**
- Invested billions in Venezuelan oil
- PDVSA joint ventures
- Accepted oil as debt repayment
- Helped circumvent US sanctions

**Post-Maduro capture (Jan 2026):**
- Assets at risk of seizure
- US unlikely to honor Russian contracts
- Years of investment potentially lost

See [[Maduro capture 2026]] and [[Monroe Doctrine]].

## Sanctions status

| Sanction | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| US (2014+) | Limited access to Western capital |
| EU (2022+) | Technology transfer blocked |
| Western exit | BP, Shell divested stakes |

## Investment case

**Not directly investable for Western investors** due to sanctions.

**Relevance:** Understanding Rosneft's losses helps frame Venezuela opportunity for US companies.
