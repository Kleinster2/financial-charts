## Life/health reinsurance leadership

Swiss Re is the world's \#1 life/health reinsurer. The life reinsurance market grew to $81B in 2024. This positions Swiss Re at the intersection of the [[PE-insurance convergence]] — as both a competitor to and potential partner with PE-owned platforms.

Unlike PE firms that use life reinsurance as a capital source for private credit deployment, Swiss Re's model is traditional risk transfer: mortality, longevity, and health risk management for primary insurers.

## Competitive positioning vs. PE-owned platforms

| Dimension | Swiss Re | PE-owned (Athene) |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Life/health approach | Risk transfer, mortality/longevity | Asset accumulation, spread income |
| Investment portfolio | Conservative, liquid | [[Private credit]], alternatives |
| Capital model | Solvency II equivalent | Bermuda sidecar + balance sheet |
| Revenue model | Premium income | Spread income + mgmt fees |

Swiss Re's life/health franchise could be disrupted if PE platforms continue expanding into traditional reinsurance territories. However, Swiss Re's mortality/longevity expertise is different from the annuity/PRT focus of PE platforms.
