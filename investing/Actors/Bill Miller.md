## Why Bill Miller matters

**Longest S&P-beating streak in history.** 15 consecutive years (next longest: 11). Proved concentrated value investing could generate sustained alpha — until it couldn't.

**2008 lesson:** Loaded up on financials (Bear Stearns, Citigroup, AIG) that collapsed. Value Trust lost 2/3 of its value. Shows even legends can blow up on concentrated bets.

**Complexity thinker:** [[Santa Fe Institute]] connection shaped his non-traditional value approach — willing to buy tech, growth at right price.
