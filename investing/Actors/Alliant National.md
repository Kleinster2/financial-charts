## Insights

**Agent-only underwriter** — Like [[Westcor Land Title]], Alliant has no direct operations that compete with independent agents. Entire business model built around serving agents, not competing with them.

**Homebuilder vertical integration** — [[Dream Finders Homes]] (NYSE: DFH) acquired Alliant in April 2025, adding title underwriting to its financial services segment. Builders increasingly capturing ancillary revenue (mortgage, title, insurance).

**20-year thesis validated** — Founded 2005 on bet that agents would prefer underwriters who don't compete with them. Grew to 700+ agents before exit.

## Founding story

**Dave Ginger** spent decades watching national underwriters treat local agents as revenue sources rather than partners. In 2005, he founded Alliant on a radical premise: an underwriter that **only** serves agents, never competes with them.

**Result:** Built largest agent-only underwriter in the country.

| Rationale | Vertical integration with existing title agency |

**Strategic logic:** Dream Finders already had title agency operations. Adding underwriter captures more of the closing economics on home sales.

**Financial impact:** DFH financial services revenue +$47M in Q2 2025, +$33M in Q3 2025 vs prior year — primarily from Alliant.
