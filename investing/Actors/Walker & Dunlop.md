## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- #1 Fannie Mae position defensible
- Multifamily fundamentals solid (housing shortage)
- Rate cuts → volume recovery
- Servicing portfolio provides recurring income
- Valuation reasonable vs peers

**Bear case:**
- CRE market stress (office bleeds into multifamily sentiment)
- Rate sensitivity on origination volume
- GSE reform risk (privatization could change economics)
- Competition from banks if they re-enter
