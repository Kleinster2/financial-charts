## History

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1982 | Santander enters Brazil |
| **2000** | **Acquires Banespa** — São Paulo state bank, largest acquisition |
| 2007 | Acquires Banco Real from ABN AMRO |
| 2009 | Integration complete, unified as Santander Brasil |
| 2009 | IPO on B3 (SANB11) |
| 2022 | Mario Leão becomes CEO |

**Banespa was transformational** — gave Santander instant scale to compete with Itaú and Bradesco. Banco Real added national footprint beyond Southeast.

---

## Competitive position

| Bank | Rank | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| [[Itaú Unibanco]] | #1 | Largest, most profitable |
| [[Bradesco]] | #2 | Struggling with fintech |
| [[Banco do Brasil]] | #3 | State-owned |
| Caixa | #4 | State-owned, housing focus |
| **Santander Brasil** | **#5** | Largest foreign bank |

**Advantage**: Global parent support, CIB network. **Disadvantage**: Foreign ownership limits some government relationships.

## Investment relevance

**Why Santander Brasil matters:**

1. **Brazil bank exposure** — Separately traded (SANB11/BSBR), pure Brazil play vs parent SAN.

2. **Foreign bank premium** — Better governance, Santander group backing, global CIB reach.

3. **DCM strength** — Bond House of the Year 2024. When Brazil issues debt, Santander is on the ticket.

4. **Rate sensitivity** — High Selic (15%) helps NIM but pressures borrowers.

5. **Valuation** — P/B ~1.0x, cheaper than Itaú but question marks vs domestic banks.
