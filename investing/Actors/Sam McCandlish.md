# Sam McCandlish

Co-founder of [[Anthropic]]. Research focused on scaling laws — co-authored "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (2020) with [[Jared Kaplan]] and others at [[OpenAI]], the paper that formalized the relationship between model size, data, compute, and performance. This work provided the theoretical foundation for the scaling paradigm that drives the entire frontier AI industry. Left OpenAI in early 2021 with six colleagues including [[Dario Amodei]] and [[Daniela Amodei]]. Still at Anthropic as of February 2026.
