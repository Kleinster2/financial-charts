## Latin America exposure

**At risk under Monroe Doctrine:**
- Venezuela joint ventures with [[PDVSA]]
- [[Brazil]] deepwater partnerships
- [[Guyana]] exploration interests

**Post-Maduro (Jan 2026):**
- Venezuelan assets uncertain
- US policy favoring American companies
- Could be excluded from future contracts

See [[Monroe Doctrine]] and [[Venezuela oil rebuild]].

## US delisting

**2021:** Removed from NYSE due to Chinese military company designation.

Still trades in Hong Kong.
