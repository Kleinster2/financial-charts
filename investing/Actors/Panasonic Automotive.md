# Panasonic Automotive

Mobility technology company carved out from [[Panasonic]] Holdings in 2024, with [[Apollo]] acquiring a majority stake.

## The carveout

[[Panasonic]] Holdings sold a majority interest to [[Apollo]] in 2024 as part of a strategic portfolio reorganization. Panasonic concluded the automotive unit was "not the best owner" to maximize growth — a reflection of the broader [[Japan corporate governance revolution]] pushing conglomerates to focus.

Since the deal closed, [[Panasonic]] Holdings shares are up ~70%.

[[Hiromi Yamaji]] ([[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] CEO) on the trend: 280 carve-outs and spin-offs in H1 2025 alone — sellers recognizing they are not the best owners. The Panasonic Automotive deal is a flagship example.

## Strategy — "joy in motion"

Nagayasu's vision: the value of a car is shifting from driving performance to the in-cabin mobility experience. Key focus areas:

- Personalization: AI-enhanced climate, comfort, and entertainment tailored to individual passengers
- Technology integration: leveraging Panasonic's sensor and display technology for next-gen cockpits
- Startup partnerships: building capability to partner across the automotive ecosystem
- Global orientation: customer response "quite positive" to transformation

## Apollo's influence

[[Apollo]]'s approach described by Nagayasu as "discipline" — fewer [[Panasonic]] group constraints, focused entirely on automotive. Not freedom, but clarity.

- Dedicated 100% to automotive (vs. competing for resources within a conglomerate)
- Clear financial KPIs (E-C as primary metric)
- Operational autonomy with accountability
- Short-term and midterm targets tracking ahead of plan

## Culture

Founder Kōnosuke Matsushita's philosophy remains the company's "backbone" — this won't change. Everything else can.

Nagayasu acknowledges some employees expressed "nostalgic feelings" about the name change (company renaming away from Panasonic brand). Initial response "not very positive, frankly." His approach: show results, and mindsets will follow.
