## Why HCA matters

**Hospital bellwether.** HCA's scale makes it the best proxy for US hospital industry health. Volume trends, payer mix shifts, and labor costs show up in HCA earnings before anywhere else.

**Policy sensitivity.** ACA exchanges and Medicaid supplemental payments flow directly to HCA's bottom line. The company is a direct read on healthcare policy implementation.
