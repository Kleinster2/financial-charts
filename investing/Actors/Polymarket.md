## What makes Polymarket, Polymarket

**Crypto-native, globally accessible.** While [[Kalshi]] went the regulated route, Polymarket built on blockchain — anyone with a crypto wallet can trade. US users technically prohibited after 2022 CFTC settlement, but enforcement is limited.

**2024 election moment:** Polymarket showed Trump 60-65% when polls showed toss-up. Trump won. This was prediction markets' mainstream validation — media started citing Polymarket probabilities alongside polls.

**The trade-off:**
- **Advantage:** Global access, no KYC friction, deeper liquidity on major events
- **Disadvantage:** No US regulatory license, can't onboard US users legally, vulnerable to enforcement

## The bull case

1. **Global access** — no geographic restrictions (except US)
2. **Crypto-native** — self-custody, permissionless
3. **ICE backing** — traditional finance validation
4. **Liquidity** — deepest markets on major events
5. **2024 proved value** — mainstream credibility

## The bear case

1. **No US license** — can't legally serve largest market
2. **Regulatory risk** — could face enforcement
3. **Kalshi competition** — if Kalshi gets federal preemption
4. **Manipulation concerns** — Polymarket faced questions about whale activity
