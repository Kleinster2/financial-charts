## Current roles

## DOGE / National Design Studio

Appointed by [[Donald Trump]] as the first-ever US Chief Design Officer, leading the **National Design Studio** within [[DOGE]]. Mission: redesign government services to be "as seamless as the Apple App Store." Executive order requires agency heads to consult with Gebbia for "initial results by July 4, 2026."

This is the design/UX angle of the DOGE efficiency push — making government digital services less terrible rather than just cutting budgets.

## Samara
