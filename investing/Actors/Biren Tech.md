## US sanctions impact

**Entity List (Oct 2022):**
- TSMC halted all manufacturing
- Can't access advanced nodes
- Had to modify BR100 to reduce capability
- Workaround: degraded specs to avoid restrictions

**Current situation:**
- Using older/domestic fabs
- Technology constrained
- But still shipping to China cloud providers

## Four Little Dragons

| Company | US sanctions | IPO | First-day gain |
|---------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| [[Moore Threads]] | No | Shanghai | +425% |
| [[MetaX]] | No | Shanghai | +693% |
| **Biren Tech** | Yes (Entity List) | HK | **+76%** |
| [[Enflame]] | No | STAR prep | — |

Biren is the only one sanctioned — limits manufacturing options but still strong HK debut.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- China GPU demand captive
- Advanced architecture (pre-sanctions)
- State backing
- Cloud provider customers

**Bear:**
- US Entity List = manufacturing constrained
- Can't access TSMC advanced nodes
- Technology frozen at 7nm
- Competitors not sanctioned
