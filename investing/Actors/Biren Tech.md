## Why Biren Tech matters

Advanced China GPU maker, but sanctioned:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2019 |
| Founder | Zhang Wen (ex-[[SenseTime]] president) |
| Key product | BR100 GPU |
| US status | Entity List (Oct 2022) |

## BR100 GPU

**Flagship AI chip:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Transistors | 77 billion |
| Die size | 1074mm² (dual-die) |
| Process | TSMC 7nm |
| Memory | 64GB HBM2E (4 stacks) |
| FP32 | 256 TFLOPS |
| INT8 | 2 PFLOPS |
| Packaging | CoWoS |

**BR104:** Scaled-down version, 128 FP32 TFLOPS.

## US sanctions impact

**Entity List (Oct 2022):**
- TSMC halted all manufacturing
- Can't access advanced nodes
- Had to modify BR100 to reduce capability
- Workaround: degraded specs to avoid restrictions

**Current situation:**
- Using older/domestic fabs
- Technology constrained
- But still shipping to China cloud providers

---

## BiLiren architecture

**2025 developments:**
- Biren 106 series launched
- 1,000+ TFLOPS BF16 (claimed)
- Supports [[Alibaba]] Tongyi QWQ-32B inference
- Full-stack [[DeepSeek]]-V3 training

Optimizing within constraints.

## IPO results (Jan 3, 2026)

**Hong Kong listing — blockbuster debut:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchange | [[HKEX]] (6082) |
| IPO price | HK$19.60 (top of range) |
| First day close | HK$34.46 |
| **First day gain** | **+76%** (peaked +119% intraday) |
| Raised | **$717M** |
| Retail subscription | **2,300x** oversubscribed |
| Cornerstone investors | 23 (state-linked funds, PE) |

**Best HK debut since Kuaishou (Feb 2021)** for $700M+ listings. HK listings $700M+ averaged +23% first day (2020-2025).

First GPU-focused stock to list in Hong Kong — "enjoys scarcity value" (China Everbright).

| Financial | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| 2024 revenue | 336.8M yuan (~$48M) |
| H1 2025 net loss | 1.6B yuan ($229M) |

## Customers

**China cloud providers:**
- Domestic hyperscalers
- Can't buy NVIDIA easily
- Biren fills gap for inference workloads
- Image recognition, NLP

## Four Little Dragons

| Company | US sanctions | IPO | First-day gain |
|---------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| [[Moore Threads]] | No | Shanghai | +425% |
| [[MetaX]] | No | Shanghai | +693% |
| **Biren Tech** | Yes (Entity List) | HK | **+76%** |
| [[Enflame]] | No | STAR prep | — |

Biren is the only one sanctioned — limits manufacturing options but still strong HK debut.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- China GPU demand captive
- Advanced architecture (pre-sanctions)
- State backing
- Cloud provider customers

**Bear:**
- US Entity List = manufacturing constrained
- Can't access TSMC advanced nodes
- Technology frozen at 7nm
- Competitors not sanctioned
