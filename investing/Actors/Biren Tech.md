## Why Biren Tech matters

Advanced China GPU maker, but sanctioned:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2019 |
| Founders | Ex-NVIDIA, Alibaba, ST |
| Key product | BR100 GPU |
| US status | Entity List (Oct 2022) |

## BR100 GPU

**Flagship AI chip:**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Transistors | 77 billion |
| Die size | 1074mm² (dual-die) |
| Process | TSMC 7nm |
| Memory | 64GB HBM2E (4 stacks) |
| FP32 | 256 TFLOPS |
| INT8 | 2 PFLOPS |
| Packaging | CoWoS |

**BR104:** Scaled-down version, 128 FP32 TFLOPS.

## US sanctions impact

**Entity List (Oct 2022):**
- TSMC halted all manufacturing
- Can't access advanced nodes
- Had to modify BR100 to reduce capability
- Workaround: degraded specs to avoid restrictions

**Current situation:**
- Using older/domestic fabs
- Technology constrained
- But still shipping to China cloud providers

## BiLiren architecture

**2025 developments:**
- Biren 106 series launched
- 1,000+ TFLOPS BF16 (claimed)
- Supports Alibaba Tongyi QWQ-32B inference
- Full-stack DeepSeek-V3 training

Optimizing within constraints.

## IPO details

**Hong Kong listing (Jan 2, 2026):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchange | HKEX (6082) |
| Raise | $600-717M |
| Cornerstone investors | 23 (state-linked funds, PE) |
| 2024 revenue | 336.8M yuan (~$48M) |

## Four Little Dragons

| Company | US sanctions | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [[Moore Threads]] | Not listed | IPO'd |
| **Biren Tech** | Entity List | IPO Jan 2026 |
| [[MetaX]] | Not listed | IPO'd |
| [[Enflame]] | Not listed | IPO prep |

Biren is the only one sanctioned — limits manufacturing options.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- China GPU demand captive
- Advanced architecture (pre-sanctions)
- State backing
- Cloud provider customers

**Bear:**
- US Entity List = manufacturing constrained
- Can't access TSMC advanced nodes
- Technology frozen at 7nm
- Competitors not sanctioned
