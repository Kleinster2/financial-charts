Cadence Design Systems — \#2 EDA company. Custom IC design leader. Duopoly with Synopsys.

---

## Why Cadence matters

Critical chip design infrastructure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | CDNS |
| Market cap | ~$75B |
| Revenue | ~$5.3B |
| Margin | ~45% operating |
| Position | \#2 EDA |

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Custom IC | Virtuoso (analog/mixed-signal) |
| Digital | Genus, Innovus |
| Verification | Xcelium, [[Palladium]], Protium |
| PCB | Allegro |
| System analysis | Clarity, Celsius |

---

## Virtuoso dominance

Analog/mixed-signal:
- Industry standard for analog design
- Used by every major chipmaker
- Decades of entrenchment
- Near-monopoly in custom IC

---

## Hardware verification

Emulation/prototyping:
- [[Palladium]] (emulation)
- Protium (prototyping)
- Faster chip verification
- Critical for complex AI chips

---

## Competitive landscape

| Player | Strength | Cadence vs |
|--------|----------|------------|
| [[Synopsys]] | Digital, IP | Strong in analog |
| [[Siemens]] EDA | PCB, automotive | Full-stack competitor |
| Ansys | Simulation | Now part of Synopsys |

Duopoly = pricing power.

---

## AI angle

AI chip design:
- More complex chips = more EDA
- AI-assisted design tools (Cadence Cerebrus)
- Emulation demand for AI chips
- Every hyperscaler designing chips

## Q4 FY2025 earnings (Feb 17, 2026)

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $1.44B (+6.2% YoY) | $5.30B (+14% YoY) |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $1.99 (beat $1.91 est) | — |
| Operating margin | — | 44.6% |
| Backlog | — | $7.8B (record) |
| Operating cash flow | $554M (+25% YoY) | — |
| Stock reaction | +7% AH | — |

Key highlights:
- Core EDA revenue grew 13% in 2025; recurring software reaccelerated to double-digit growth in Q4
- Hardware business delivered record year — 30+ new customers, substantially higher repeat demand from AI and hyperscalers
- IP business saw ~25% revenue growth in 2025, driven by AI, HPC, and automotive
- 7 of top 10 customers in 2025 were "Dynamic Duo" (EDA + hardware) customers

FY2026 guidance: Revenue $5.9-6.0B, non-GAAP operating margin 44.75-45.75%, non-GAAP EPS $8.05-8.15, operating cash flow ~$2B. Pending [[Hexagon]] design/engineering acquisition not included.
