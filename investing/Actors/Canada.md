| [[Stellantis]] | Reneged on Toronto-area [[Jeep]] factory restart |
| Chinese EV JV | [[Magna]], [[Linamar]], [[Martinrea]] + [[BYD]]/[[Chery]] — export-oriented |
| EV tariff exemption | 49,000 Chinese-built EVs/year exempt from 100% tariff |
| Korean target | [[Hyundai]]/[[Kia]] sell hundreds of thousands but make zero in Canada |
| Import credit system | Build more in Canada → pay less on US imports; tradeable credits |
| Current production | Honda and [[Toyota]] = ~75% of Canadian auto output |

See [[Canada-China relations]] for JV details.
