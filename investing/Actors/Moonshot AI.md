## Kimi K2.5 (Jan 27, 2026)

Open-source multimodal model:

| Spec | Details |
|------|---------|
| Parameters | **1T total** (MoE), 32B active |
| Vision encoder | 400M parameters |
| Training data | 15T tokens (text + multimodal) |
| Architecture | Mixture of Experts |
| Optimization | Muon algorithm (faster training) |
| License | Open source (Hugging Face) |

**Benchmarks:**

| Benchmark | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| HLE-Full | **#1** (highest ever) |
| SWE-Bench Verified | 76.8% |
| SWE-Bench Multilingual | 73.0% |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | 50.8% |
| LiveCodeBench v6 | **85.0%** |

Claims to beat GPT-5.2 on several benchmarks. Generally within a few points of Claude 4.5 Opus.

**Agent Swarm capability:**
- Up to 100 sub-agents running in parallel
- 1,500 tool calls concurrently
- 4.5x faster than single-agent models
- Splits complex tasks into sub-steps automatically

**Kimi Code:** New open-source coding tool launched alongside K2.5, competing with [[Claude]] Code and Gemini CLI.

## Model history

| Model | Date | Key feature |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Kimi v1 | 2023 | 128K context (first at this scale) |
| Kimi K1.5 | Jan 2025 | Matched OpenAI o1 on math/coding |
| Kimi K2 | Jul 2025 | 1T MoE, 32B active |
| Kimi K2 Thinking | Nov 2025 | Open-source reasoning, ~$4.6M training |
| **Kimi K2.5** | **Jan 2026** | Multimodal + agent swarm |

**Early differentiator:** First model with 128K context window. Long-context was Kimi's initial moat — now commoditized.

## Cap table

Limited public disclosure. Known details:

| Holder | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Yang Zhilin | Founder/CEO |
| [[Alibaba]] | Series A lead, cornerstone |
| [[Tencent]] | Series B participant |
| IDG Capital | Series C lead |
| Sequoia China | Early investor |
| Meituan | Series A participant |
| Xiaohongshu | Series A participant |

**Controversy:** Zhang Yutong reportedly concealed 14% stake in free shares. Separate from main investor dispute.

**Legal dispute:** Five investors in Yang's prior company (Recurrent AI) filed arbitration — GSR Ventures, Jingya Capital, Boyu Capital, Huashan Capital, Wanyu Capital. Alleged Yang launched Moonshot without consent waivers. No resolution disclosed.

## MAU trajectory

| Period | Kimi MAU | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Oct 2024 | **36M** | Peak |
| Jan 2026 | **10-15M** | Current |
| Decline | **>50%** | Long-context moat eroded |

**Comparison:** [[Doubao]] ([[ByteDance]]) has 160M+ MAU stable, leveraging Douyin distribution.

**Why the decline:** Long-context was Kimi's differentiator. Now [[Alibaba]]'s Tongyi Qianwen, [[Baidu]]'s Wenxin, and [[DeepSeek]] all have similar capability. When "long-text" stopped being unique, Kimi lost its edge.

---

## Competitive positioning

| vs | Moonshot advantage | Disadvantage |
|----|-------------------|--------------|
| [[DeepSeek]] | More funding, consumer focus | Less efficiency cred |
| [[Doubao]] | Open source, pure AI play | No Douyin distribution |
| [[MiniMax]] | Private (flexible) | No public market validation |
| US labs | Chinese market access | US export controls, talent |

---

## Investment implications

**Private company** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Alibaba]] — major investor
- [[Tencent]] — investor
- IDG Capital — lead Series C

**Watch for:**
- IPO path (following [[MiniMax]], [[Zhipu]])
- Kimi MAU recovery
- K2.5 adoption vs [[DeepSeek]], open models
- Legal dispute resolution
