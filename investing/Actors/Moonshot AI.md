# Moonshot AI

Chinese AI lab behind the **Kimi** model series. Backed by [[HongShan]] ([[Neil Shen]]). Kimi K2.5 is #2 on the OpenRouter leaderboard by token volume (1.16T tokens, Feb 2026). Part of the wave of Chinese AI labs producing competitive models at lower cost than Western counterparts.

## Distillation accusations (Feb 23, 2026)

[[Anthropic]] accused Moonshot AI of **3.4 million exchanges** with [[Claude]] via fraudulent accounts, targeting:
- Agentic reasoning and tool use
- Coding and data analysis
- Computer-use agent development
- Computer vision

Part of a broader pattern alongside [[DeepSeek]] (150K exchanges) and [[MiniMax]] (13M exchanges). Combined: 24,000+ fake accounts, 16M+ total exchanges. [[Anthropic]] attributed the campaign through IP correlation, metadata, and cross-lab corroboration.
