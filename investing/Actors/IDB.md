**IDB** — Inter-American Development Bank. Largest multilateral lender to Latin America. AI Framework (2025) targeting digital transformation. Estimates 15% infrastructure cost reduction via AI could add 6% to regional GDP over 10 years.

> **Key insight:** IDB's AI Framework identifies three structural barriers holding back Latin American AI: uneven digital infrastructure, limited data availability, and insufficient skills. Their estimate—15% infrastructure cost savings via digital tech = 6% GDP boost over a decade—quantifies the economic stakes of getting AI adoption right.
