## UWM vs Rocket

| Metric | UWM | [[Rocket Companies]] |
|--------|-----|---------------------|
| 2024 loans | 366,078 | 361,071 |
| 2024 volume | $139.7B | $101.2B |
| Channel | Wholesale | Retail/DTC |
| Servicing | Limited | $2.1T (post-Mr. Cooper) |
| Market share | ~6% | ~6% |

**Key difference:** UWM has no large servicing portfolio. Rocket's Mr. Cooper acquisition gives it recapture advantage.

---

## Competitive dynamics

**Threat from Rocket:**
- Rocket + Mr. Cooper = recapture machine
- Could return Rocket to \#1 in 2026
- UWM needs "something spectacular" to maintain lead

**UWM's defense:**
- Broker loyalty programs
- Technology/speed advantage
- Purchase lending strength (\#1 purchase lender)

## Rate sensitivity

| **Rising rates** | Purchase-only, volume drops |
| **Stable rates** | Steady purchase business |

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- \#1 originator momentum
- Purchase lending strength
- Broker channel growing share
- Operating leverage on volume

**Bear case:**
- No servicing income buffer
- Rocket recapture threat
- Rate-dependent earnings
- Broker channel cyclical
