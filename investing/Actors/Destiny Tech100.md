## Price history

![[dxyz-price-chart.png]]
*Listed at $9 in Mar 2024, spiked to $105 within two weeks on retail frenzy, crashed to $8 by late 2024. Second rally to $80 in early 2025 faded. Now ~$27 -- down 74% from peak but well above IPO price. Premium to NAV compressed to ~33% as stock declines while NAV grows.*

![[dxyz-price-vs-nav.png]]
*Price (blue) vs quarterly NAV/share (orange), with premium to NAV shown below. Peak premium of 1,868% in Apr 2024. Convergence is happening from both directions: NAV surged from $6.31 to $19.97 in H2 2025 (SpaceX/OpenAI markups) while stock price fell from ~$40 to ~$27. Premium compressed to ~33% by Feb 2026.*

Stock price has been wildly volatile since listing:

| Date | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Mar 26, 2024 | NYSE listing | $9 |
| Apr 8, 2024 | Peak frenzy | $105 |
| Apr 2024 (late) | Crash | $27 |
| 52-week low | | $19.71 |
| 52-week high | | $55.38 |
| Feb 23, 2026 | Current | ~$27 |

Daily turnover hit 80% at peak -- average holding period of ~1.2 days. Short-selling costs exceeded 100% annualized, preventing arbitrage.

## NAV history

| Quarter | NAV/share | QoQ |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Q4 2023 | $4.84 | -- |
| Q1 2024 | $5.07 | +5% |
| Q2 2024 | $5.15 | +2% |
| Q3 2024 | $5.32 | +3% |
| Q4 2024 | $6.44 | +21% |
| Q1 2025 | $6.31 | -2% |
| Q2 2025 | $6.92 | +10% |
| Q3 2025 | $11.37 | +64% |
| Q4 2025 | $19.97 | +76% |

NAV up 210% YoY in FY2025. Q3-Q4 2025 surge driven by SpaceX and OpenAI markups.

## Premium to NAV

The defining feature of DXYZ. Acadian Asset Management documented a peak premium of ~2,000% in Apr 2024 -- the highest in closed-end fund history, exceeding the previous record of 1,235% set in 1929.

| Period | Approx premium |
|--------|---------------|
| Listing (Mar 2024) | ~86% |
| Peak (Apr 2024) | ~2,000% |
| Feb 2026 | ~33% |

Premium has compressed as NAV grew and stock price declined. At ~33%, investors pay $1.33 for every $1 of NAV — approaching rationality relative to the 2,000% peak.

Key structural issue: CEFs don't issue new shares after IPO, so no creation/redemption mechanism exists to close the gap (unlike ETFs). Short-selling costs too high for arbitrage.

As Morningstar and Acadian have noted, identical SpaceX exposure is available at NAV through mutual funds at [[Fidelity]], [[Baron Capital]], and [[Neuberger Berman]] -- making the DXYZ premium purely a retail access/liquidity premium.

## Portfolio

As of Dec 31, 2025, >50% of capital deployed. Target: 100 holdings.

| Entertainment | [[Beast Industries]], [[Discord]] |
| Aerospace | [[Hermeus]], [[Relativity Space]], [[Boom Supersonic]] |
| Other | [[Chime]], [[Impossible Foods]], [[Klarna]] |

## Performance

| Period | DXYZ NAV return | Nasdaq Composite |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| FY 2023 | -7.3% | +43.4% |
| FY 2024 | +33.1% | +28.6% |
| FY 2025 NAV growth | +210% | -- |

FY2023 significant underperformance vs public benchmarks. FY2024 modestly beat Nasdaq on NAV basis. FY2025 NAV surge driven by private market repricing (SpaceX, OpenAI valuation rounds).

Stock price return =/= NAV return due to premium fluctuation. 52-week stock return: -39%.

## Financials

CEF financials differ from operating companies -- key metrics are NAV, portfolio fair value, and expense structure rather than revenue/earnings.

| Metric | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | FY 2023 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| NAV/share | $19.97 | $6.44 | $4.84 |
| NAV growth | +210% | +33% | -7.3% |
| Portfolio fair value | $434M | -- | -- |
| Cash & equivalents | $205M | -- | -- |
| Management fee | 2.50% of avg gross assets | 2.50% | 2.50% |
| Market cap | ~$444M | -- | -- |

No dividends paid. Fund reinvests all returns. True expense ratio exceeds management fee due to SPV-level costs on holdings like [[Anthropic]] and [[CHAOS Industries]].

## Investment case

Bull:
- Retail access to pre-IPO tech (SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe)
- [[SpaceX]] IPO could be a massive catalyst (potential $1.5T valuation)
- NAV growing rapidly as private markets reprice
- Premium compressing toward more sustainable levels
- Active capital deployment continuing ($127M post-Q4)

Bear:
- Premium to NAV means overpaying for underlying assets
- 2.50% management fee is expensive; true all-in cost higher (SPV expenses)
- Identical exposure available at NAV through mutual funds
- Illiquid private holdings = hard to value, marks can be subjective
- Concentrated portfolio (SpaceX ~35%) = single-name risk
- No creation/redemption mechanism to close premium
- Co-founder lawsuit (ouster scheme alleged in Delaware Chancery)
- -39% stock return over past year despite 210% NAV growth
