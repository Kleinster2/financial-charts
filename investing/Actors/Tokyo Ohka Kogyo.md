## Why TOK matters

With [[JSR Corporation]] now private, TOK is the best public way to play the photoresist chokepoint:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 4186.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~¥500B (~$3.3B) |
| Global photoresist share | ~20-25% |
| EUV share | Top 3 (with JSR, Shin-Etsu = 90%) |
| Primary business | >50% revenue from electronic materials |

---

## Business mix

| Segment | % Revenue | Products |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Electronic functional materials** | >50% | [[Photoresists]], packaging materials |
| High-density packaging | ~15% | [[Advanced packaging]] materials |
| LCD/Display | ~15% | Display photoresists |
| Other | ~20% | Equipment, process materials |

---

## Product portfolio

| Type | Position | Trend |
|------|----------|-------|
| **EUV photoresists** | Top 3 | +35% sales growth (2024) |
| **ArF immersion** | Strong | +15% target (2024) |
| **KrF** | Market leader | Stable demand |
| **High-density packaging** | Growing | Chiplet/[[HBM]] tailwind |

## 2024-2025 targets

| Metric | [[Target]] |
|--------|--------|
| Advanced materials sales | +15% |
| EUV photoresist sales | +35% |
| Driver | AI chip demand |

---

## Competitive position

**[[Japan]] dominance:** JSR + TOK + Shin-Etsu = 90%+ of EUV photoresists

| Company | Share | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private |
| **TOK** | ~20-25% | **Public** |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Public (diversified) |

**TOK advantage:** Largest pure-play photoresist company still publicly traded.

## Customers

- [[Samsung]] — memory and foundry
- [[SK Hynix]] — memory (Korea expansion)
- [[Intel]] — development partner
- [[TSMC]] — leading-edge nodes
- All major fabs globally

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only large-cap public pure-play photoresist
- EUV demand structural (every leading node needs it)
- [[Japan]] monopoly position defensible
- Capacity expansion positions for 2nm wave
- Intel partnership validates technology

**Bear:**
- Cyclical (follows chip cycle)
- Yen exposure
- JSR (private) and Shin-Etsu (diversified) competition
- Technology risk (metal-oxide resists)
- Customer concentration

---

## Valuation context

Pure-play scarcity premium — with JSR private, TOK is the cleanest public exposure to photoresist growth.
