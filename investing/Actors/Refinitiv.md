## Competitive position

| Company | Market share | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| [[Bloomberg LP]] | ~33% | Dominant, higher price |
| **Refinitiv/LSEG** | ~20% | Losing share, cheaper |
| [[S&P Global]] (Capital IQ) | ~6% | Corporate finance focus |
| [[FactSet]] | ~4.5% | Buy-side research |

**The problem:** Eikon lost ~$900M in revenue over the decade before acquisition. Bloomberg's network effects (chat/messaging) created stickiness Refinitiv couldn't match.

**LSEG's thesis:** Combine Refinitiv data with LSEG's exchange/clearing infrastructure to create integrated offering.
