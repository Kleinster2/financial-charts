## Colony Capital legacy

Barrack built Colony as an opportunistic real estate investor:
- Hotels and hospitality
- Healthcare real estate
- Industrial
- Credit

The legacy real estate portfolio became an overhang as digital infrastructure emerged as the growth opportunity. Marc Ganzi's takeover in 2020 led to complete asset rotation — $40B of legacy assets sold, company renamed to DigitalBridge.
