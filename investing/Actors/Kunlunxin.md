| Filing date | January 2, 2026 |
| Exchange | [[HKEX]] |
| Structure | Spin-off from Baidu |
| Baidu stake post-IPO | ~59% controlling |
| Expected timing | Early 2027 |

**Market reaction**: Baidu stock +9.4% on announcement. Analyst price targets jumped from ~HK$100 to ~HK$155 (Sept 2025).

## Origins

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2012 | Founded as internal Baidu unit |
| 2018 | First Kunlun chip announced |
| 2020 | Kunlun 1 production |
| 2021 | Kunlun 2 (7nm) |
| 2024 | Independent operations |
| 2026 | HK IPO filing |

Started as Baidu's internal project to support search, cloud, and AI workloads.

## Competitive positioning

### vs Chinese peers

| Competitor | Comparison |
|------------|------------|
| Huawei [[Ascend]] | Ascend more advanced, but entity list constraints |
| Cambricon | Smaller, less integrated |
| [[Biren Tech]] | Struggled with export controls |
| [[Moore Threads]] | [[Gaming]]/graphics focus |

Kunlunxin advantage: Baidu as captive customer + ecosystem.

**Software strength**: "Instead of forcing users to adopt a closed system, Kunlunxin works well with common AI frameworks and makes it easier to move workloads from NVIDIA." — [[Counterpoint Research]]

### vs NVIDIA

| Aspect | Kunlunxin | NVIDIA |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Performance | Behind | Leading |
| Availability | Unrestricted in [[China]] | H200 limited, Blackwell blocked |
| Ecosystem | Developing | CUDA dominance |
| Price | Lower | Premium |

**The trade-off**: Worse performance, but actually available.

---

## Export control beneficiary

Kunlunxin exists because of [[Export controls]]:

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| NVIDIA restrictions | [[China]] must build alternatives |
| H200 limits | Demand for domestic chips |
| Blackwell ban | Ceiling on accessible NVIDIA perf |
| [[CHIPS Act]] guardrails | Foreign fabs can't serve [[China]] |

Every tightening of US controls is bullish for Kunlunxin TAM.

## Customers

| Customer type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| **Baidu** | Search, Cloud, [[Ernie]] AI |
| **[[China]] Mobile** | 1B CNY orders (2025), also investor |
| **External** | >50% of 2025 revenue |
| **Enterprise** | Government, telecom, SOE cloud |

External sales exceeding internal is key IPO narrative.

**Use case focus**: Best for inference workloads where supply stability and cost matter more than peak performance. Government, telecom, and state-owned cloud are sweet spots.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only path for [[China]] AI scale
- Export controls as tailwind
- Baidu captive demand
- External revenue growing
- HK IPO unlocks value
- JPMorgan: 6x revenue growth to 2026

**Bear:**
- Far behind NVIDIA performance
- Manufacturing constraints (SMIC process limits)
- Competition from Huawei Ascend
- Ecosystem development costs
- Geopolitical risk (further restrictions)
