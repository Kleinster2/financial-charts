## Why Zhipu matters

First Chinese AI lab to go public:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Full name | Knowledge Atlas Technology JSC Ltd. |
| Ticker | 2513.HK ([[HKEX]]) |
| Market cap | ~$19B (Feb 12) |
| IPO date | January 8, 2026 |
| IPO valuation | $6.6B |
| Founders | Tang Jie, Li Juanzi (Tsinghua professors) |

Tang Jie on US gap (Jan 2026): "The real answer is that the gap may actually be widening."

## Product: GLM models

ChatGLM series — open-source foundation models, bilingual (Chinese/English).

### GLM-5 (Feb 11, 2026)

| Metric | GLM-5 | GLM-4.7 |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Parameters | 744B | 355B |
| Training data | 28.5T tokens | — |
| Architecture | DeepSeek Sparse Attention | — |
| License | Open-source | — |

Claims industry-leading scores for open models in coding and agentic tasks, surpassing [[Google]] DeepMind's Gemini 3 Pro on internal benchmarks. Claims to approach [[Claude]] Opus 4.5 on coding. Topped open-source leaderboard on Artificial Analysis.

Milestone: trained GLM-Image entirely on [[Huawei]] Ascend chips — first Chinese AI company to train a major model fully on domestic silicon. [[DeepSeek]] has struggled with Huawei hardware.

Framing shift: Zhipu describes GLM-5 as moving from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering" — AI-automated coding at larger scale.

Stock surged ~70% in the week of launch (Feb 10-12), hitting HK$405 (+249% from IPO). Catalysts: GLM-5 release + JPMorgan Overweight initiation (see below).

Competing with [[ChatGPT]], [[Ernie]], [[Qwen]], [[DeepSeek]]. Enterprise API available. Part of [[China]]'s "rising stars" alongside Moonshot, MiniMax.

## Hong Kong IPO (Jan 8, 2026)

First major Chinese AI startup to IPO — beat [[OpenAI]] and [[Anthropic]] to public markets.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IPO size | $558M |
| IPO price | HK$116.20 |
| First day close | HK$131.50 (+13.2%) |
| Post-debut (Jan 10) | +36% from IPO price |
| Valuation | $7.4B |
| Retail subscription | 1,159x oversubscribed |

Use of proceeds: 70% to R&D for general-purpose AI models.

Investors (pre-IPO): Alibaba, [[Tencent]], [[Meituan]], [[Xiaomi]], [[Saudi Aramco]], Prosperity7

Part of wave of Chinese AI/chip firms listing in HK:

| Company | Date | Performance |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [[Biren Tech]] | Jan 3 | +76% |
| Zhipu | Jan 8 | +13.2% |
| [[MiniMax]] | Jan 9 | — |

## JPMorgan initiation (Feb 10, 2026)

[[JPMorgan]] analyst Olivia Xu initiated coverage with Overweight rating and HK$400 price target. Key calls:

| Metric | JPMorgan view |
|--------|---------------|
| Rating | Overweight |
| Target | HK$400 |
| Sales CAGR | 127% through 2030 |
| Profitability | 2029 |
| Thesis | Potential leader in next phase of global AI value creation |

JPMorgan argues China's AI industry is consolidating from 200+ model developers to <10, and Zhipu is positioned to survive as an independent foundation model lab with expanding international footprint.

Also initiated [[MiniMax]] at Overweight (HK$700 target). [[Goldman Sachs]] initiated around the same time.

Stock climbed 24% to record high on the initiation day alone, before GLM-5 added another leg up.

---

## Pricing power

February 2026: Zhipu hiked prices on GLM Coding Plan subscriptions by at least 30%, citing rapid user growth. Base coding plan remains ~20 yuan/month (~$3) — roughly 1/7 the price of [[Claude]] Pro.

Tension: [[DeepSeek]]'s aggressive API pricing (Q4 2025) pressured public cloud margins, pushing Zhipu to double down on higher-margin enterprise/on-prem contracts (84.5% of 2024 revenue was on-prem/privatized cloud).

---

## Competitive position

[[China]] AI labs:

| Company | Backing | Model |
|---------|---------|-------|
| [[DeepSeek]] | High-Flyer quant fund | R1/V3 |
| [[Alibaba]] | Alibaba Group | [[Qwen]] |
| [[ByteDance]] | ByteDance | [[Doubao]] |
| [[Baidu]] | Baidu | [[Ernie]] |
| Zhipu | Independent | GLM |
| [[MiniMax]] | Independent | Various |
| Moonshot | VC-backed | Kimi |

## Investment case

Bull:
- First publicly traded pure-play foundation model developer globally
- JPMorgan Overweight, 127% sales CAGR projection through 2030
- GLM-5 competitive with frontier Western models on coding/agentic benchmarks
- On-prem/enterprise model (84.5% of revenue) = stickier, higher-margin than API
- International expansion via "sovereign AI" alliances (ASEAN, Belt and Road)
- Successfully training on domestic chips ([[Huawei]] Ascend) — reduces Entity List impact

Bear:
- Cumulative losses of RMB 6.2B, breakeven not until 2029
- Cloud gross margin collapsed to -0.4% (H1 2025) under [[DeepSeek]] pricing pressure
- P/S ~150x on 2024 revenue — priced for perfection
- US Entity List (Jan 2025) cuts off [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200 access
- Crowded market consolidating — may not survive the shakeout
- R&D burn at 7-8x revenue is unsustainable without continued capital raises

M&A angle (Jan 2026): Bloomberg Opinion (Parmy Olson) named Zhipu and Moonshot AI as potential US acquisition targets for Alphabet or [[Microsoft]]. However, HK IPO makes outright acquisition less likely than if still private. See [[AI consolidation]].
