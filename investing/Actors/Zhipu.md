Claims industry-leading scores for open models in coding and agentic tasks, surpassing [[Google]] DeepMind's Gemini 3 Pro on internal benchmarks. Still lags [[Claude]] on coding.

Milestone: trained GLM-Image entirely on [[Huawei]] Ascend chips — first Chinese AI company to train a major model fully on domestic silicon. [[DeepSeek]] has struggled with Huawei hardware.

Stock up >50% in the week following launch + JPMorgan coverage initiation.

Competing with [[ChatGPT]], [[Ernie]], [[Qwen]], [[DeepSeek]]. Enterprise API available. Part of [[China]]'s "rising stars" alongside Moonshot, MiniMax.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Leading [[China]] AI lab
- HK listing = international capital
- [[China]] AI demand growing
- Model performance improving

Bear:
- Crowded market (many [[China]] AI labs)
- DeepSeek efficiency shock pressures pricing
- Profitability unclear
- Export control risk on compute access

M&A angle (Jan 2026): Bloomberg Opinion (Parmy Olson) named Zhipu and Moonshot AI as potential US acquisition targets for Alphabet or [[Microsoft]]. However, HK IPO makes outright acquisition less likely than if still private. See [[AI consolidation]].
