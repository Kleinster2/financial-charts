- Model performance improving

**Bear:**
- Crowded market (many China AI labs)
- DeepSeek efficiency shock pressures pricing
- Profitability unclear
- Export control risk on compute access

**M&A angle (Jan 2026):** Bloomberg Opinion (Parmy Olson) named Zhipu and Moonshot AI as potential US acquisition targets for Alphabet or Microsoft. However, HK IPO makes outright acquisition less likely than if still private. See [[AI consolidation]].
