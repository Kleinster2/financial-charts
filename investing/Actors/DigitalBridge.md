![[dbrg-price-chart.png]]
*DBRG (blue) massively underperformed diversified peers through 2024, then spiked on SoftBank takeout news (Dec 2025). Colony Capital legacy overhang finally resolved. vs [[Blackstone|BX]] · [[Brookfield|BAM]] · [[Blue Owl|OWL]]*

![[dbrg-fundamentals.png]]
*Asset manager economics: Revenue swings with carried interest realizations and asset sales. Q2 2023 loss from Wafra settlement. Q4 2023 gain from disposition. Revenue declining as DBRG transitions to pure fee-based model.*

## SoftBank acquisition (Dec 2025)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquirer | [[SoftBank]] |
| Price | **$4B** |
| Market cap (Jan 2026) | **$2.8B** |
| Premium | **43%** over market cap |
| 2025 stock performance | **+35%** YTD |
| Expected close | H2 2026 |
| Post-acquisition | Operates as separate platform, Marc Ganzi continues as CEO |

**Strategic rationale:**
- SoftBank needs DC infrastructure for AI ambitions
- DigitalBridge's Vantage building Stargate Wisconsin (~1GW)
- Deep LP relationships — SoftBank (proven capital raiser) + DigitalBridge investor network = fundraising synergies

**SoftBank also:** In talks to acquire Switch separately at ~$50B. Sold entire [[NVIDIA]] stake ($5.83B) to fund AI infrastructure.

**Why only $4B for $108B AUM?** Asset manager math — DBRG doesn't own the $108B, they manage it for LPs:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $108B (LP money, not DBRG's) |
| FEEUM | $40.7B (fee-earning portion) |
| Fee revenue | ~$400M/year (~1% mgmt fee) |
| $4B deal | **~10x fee revenue** |

10x fee revenue is reasonable for an asset manager. [[Blackstone]] trades at 15-20x but has diversified strategies, longer track record, higher carry realization, and a working stock price. DBRG was down 50%+ pre-deal — Colony Capital legacy overhang. The 65% premium to pre-leak price tells you how broken the stock was.

SoftBank is buying the **fee stream + GP economics** (management fees + 20% carried interest on future appreciation), not the underlying assets.

## Why DigitalBridge matters

DigitalBridge is the only large pure-play digital infrastructure investor:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | **$108B** (Sept 2025) |
| DC capacity | **5.4GW** in development/operation |
| Focus | 100% digital infrastructure |
| Segments | Data centers, towers, fiber, edge |
| Structure | Asset manager (fee income) |

---

## Pure-play advantage

**Unlike diversified competitors:**
- [[Blackstone]]: Data centers are subset of $1T+ AUM
- [[Brookfield]]: DC part of broader infrastructure
- [[Blue Owl]]: Digital infra is one strategy

**DigitalBridge:** 100% focused on digital infrastructure. Specialized expertise.

|------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2024 | $607M | $71M | Transition to pure fee model |
| 2023 | $821M | $65M | Wafra settlement loss offset by dispositions |
| 2022 | $695M | — | Switch acquisition ($11B) |
| 2021 | $388M | — | Digital pivot complete, Colony renamed |
| 2020 | $416M | — | Ganzi becomes CEO, asset rotation begins |

*Asset manager revenue = management fees + carried interest + investment income. Volatile by nature — swings with realizations and mark-to-market. Fee-related earnings (FRE) is the stable metric.*
