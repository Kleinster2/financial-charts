## Business model

Launched with a Ghost site and a [[Stripe]] account. No office, no VC, no board. Subscription revenue covers four salaries plus recent hires (science journalist Becky Ferreira, audience growth lead Case Hartsfield).

Key milestones:
- ~3,000 paid subscribers by Mar 2024
- ~11,000 paid subscribers by Aug 2025
- Requires email registration for all readers (conversion funnel + AI bot protection)
- Bought 404media.com domain (launched on .co)
- Ran a Super Bowl ad in Feb 2026 — local slot in Ottumwa, Iowa on KYOU for $2,550

## Investment case

Bull:
- Proven that small, focused newsrooms can be profitable without VC
- Reporter-owned structure aligns incentives — no pressure to pivot to video or chase scale
- High-impact investigations create brand moat and subscriber loyalty
- Wired partnership extends reach without diluting ownership
- AI/surveillance/privacy beats have growing reader demand

Bear:
- Four-person dependency — key-person risk on every founder
- $100/yr subscription in a market full of free alternatives
- No path to significant scale without changing the model
- Beats overlap heavily with larger outlets ([[The New York Times]], Wired, Ars Technica)
- Relies on continued reader willingness to pay for journalism
