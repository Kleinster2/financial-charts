**CAF** — Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean. $2.8B invested in digital infrastructure over 6 years. Financing regional AI infrastructure, HPC networks, and sovereign AI initiatives including Latam-GPT.

> **Key insight:** CAF is emerging as the key development financier for Latin America's AI infrastructure buildout. Unlike commercial lenders, CAF can take long-horizon bets on digital public goods—data centers, HPC networks, digital ID systems—that won't generate returns for years but are essential for AI competitiveness.

## Infrastructure gap assessment

CAF's Enrique Zapata on LatAm AI infrastructure:

> "The region lacks high-performance data centers powered by GPUs, which are essential for large-scale AI. CAF is actively working with countries to finance such infrastructure and to support sovereign, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystems."

**Market context:** LatAm data center market ~$5B (2025), forecast to double by 2029.
