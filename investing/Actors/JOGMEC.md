**JOGMEC** — [[Japan]]'s government agency for securing mineral and energy supply chains. Maintains a 34-mineral national stockpile (60–180 days), finances overseas mining investments, and has been the template for [[Project Vault]] and allied critical minerals policy. Created 2004 under [[METI]].

## Why JOGMEC matters

JOGMEC is the most successful example of a state-backed critical minerals diversification strategy. In a decade, it reduced [[Japan]]'s dependence on [[China]] for rare earths from **90% to 58%** — through a combination of overseas investment, stockpiling, technology development, and recycling.

Western countries are now copying this model. The US–Japan Critical Minerals Agreement (Oct 2025) explicitly draws on JOGMEC's approach.

## National stockpile

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Legal basis | Act on JOGMEC, Article III.11(xiii) |
| Coverage | 34 types of rare metals |
| Target | 60 days standard, up to 180 days for high-risk minerals |
| Specifics | Undisclosed (market-sensitive) |
| Mechanism | JOGMEC subsidizes borrowing costs for purchasing + warehousing |

Expanded in 2020 to 180 days for minerals with high geopolitical risk (e.g., those dominated by [[China]]).

## Overseas investment portfolio

100+ projects in 15 countries since 2004. Over $600M invested. Key partnerships:

| Partner | Country | Mineral | Investment | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| [[Lynas Rare Earths]] | [[Australia]] | Rare earths (NdPr) | $250M (2011) + $134M (2023) | Supplies 90% of Japan's NdPr |
| Namibia Critical Metals | Namibia | Heavy rare earths | $17–20M for 40–50% stake | Lofdal project |
| Caremag / Carester | [[France]] | Heavy rare earths (Dy, Tb) | EUR 110M (with Iwatani) | First non-China heavy REE refinery, operational end 2026 |
| REAlloys | US/[[Canada]] | Rare earths + magnets | MoU, financing under discussion | First JOGMEC partnership with US producer |
| ECERDC | Malaysia | Rare earths | MoC signed Dec 2025 | Cooperative framework |

**Caremag is significant** — the first facility outside [[China]] to extract heavy rare earths (dysprosium, terbium), critical for high-temperature magnets in EVs and defense.

## US–Japan Critical Minerals Agreement (Oct 2025)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Signed | October 2025, Tokyo |
| Parties | PM Takaichi, President [[Donald Trump]] |
| Scope | End-to-end supply chain resilience |
| Key provisions | Accelerated permitting, fair pricing mechanisms, coordinated stockpiling |
| Model | Explicitly based on JOGMEC's patient, state-backed approach |

First serious institutional framework between the two allies for minerals supply chain cooperation. Complements US [[Project Vault]] and [[Australia]]'s Critical Minerals Framework Agreement (also Oct 2025, $1B+ commitment).

## Strategy results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| China rare earth dependence | 90% (2010) | 58% (2024) |
| Supply sources | China-dominated | Australia, Canada, Namibia, France, Malaysia |
| Approach | Single-source imports | Diversified investment + stockpile + substitution + recycling |

The 2010 China rare earth embargo (triggered by a Japan-China maritime dispute) was the catalyzing event. Japan's ¥100B ($1.2B) supplementary budget in response laid the groundwork for the current strategy.

## Deep-sea mining optionality

Japan's Minamitorishima (Marcus Island) deep-sea deposit contains massive rare earth mud resources. Commercial viability of deep-sea extraction technologies could transform [[Japan]] from net importer to potential exporter. Timeline: 2025–2030 for feasibility determination.

## Investment case (for portfolio context)

JOGMEC is not investable directly — it's a government agency. But its activities create investable signals:

- **JOGMEC-backed projects** get de-risked (equity, offtake, technology transfer)
- [[Lynas Rare Earths]] is the prime example — JOGMEC backing transformed it into the only non-China major rare earth producer
- REAlloys partnership signals JOGMEC expanding into North American magnet supply chains
- JOGMEC's stockpile purchases move markets in cobalt, tungsten, rare earths
