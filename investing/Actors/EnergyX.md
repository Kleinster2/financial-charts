**EnergyX** — Lithium extraction technology company expanding into nuclear materials. GET-Lit direct extraction tech. NUKE-it platform for fusion/fission lithium isotopes.

---

## Why EnergyX matters

Two-pronged play on energy transition materials:

| Business | Product | Market |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Lithium extraction** | GET-Lit technology | EV batteries |
| **Nuclear materials** | NUKE-it platform | Fusion/fission reactors |

Pivoting lithium expertise toward nuclear supply chain gap.

---

## GET-Lit lithium technology

| Metric | GET-Lit | Legacy evaporation |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Recovery rate | 90%+ | ~30% |
| Processing time | Days | 12-18 months |
| Water usage | Lower | High |
| Brine compatibility | All types | Limited |

**Key claim:** Only company working across all brine types with existing infrastructure integration.

Chilean pilots: 96%+ lithium recovery consistently.

## NUKE-it nuclear platform

Launched January 2025. Addresses critical supply gap:

| Product | Purity | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Lithium-6** | 15% enriched | Tritium breeding (fusion) |
| **Lithium-7** | 99.999% | MSR coolants (FLiBe, FLiNaK) |

**Why it matters:** Fusion reactors need Li-6 to breed tritium fuel. Molten salt reactors need ultra-pure Li-7 for coolant systems. Neither material exists in volume today.

### NUKE-it timeline

| Phase | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Nuclear-grade testing | 2025 |
| Isotope separation pilot | 2026 |
| Partner validation | 2027 |
| Pre-commercial facility | 2028 |
| Commercial-scale hub | 2029 |

Also pursuing uranium and thorium extraction R&D.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Total raised | $181M |
| Valuation | ~$2B |
| 2023 revenue | $210K |
| 2024 revenue | $385K |
| YoY growth | 83% |

**Note:** Pre-commercial. Revenue is from testing/pilots. Valuation reflects technology/project potential, not current cash flows.

---

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Differentiated extraction tech (90%+ recovery)
- Nuclear supply chain first-mover
- Strategic backing (GM, POSCO, Eni)
- Government support (DOE, EXIM)
- Dual markets (lithium + nuclear)

**Bear:**
- Private (Reg A offerings only)
- Pre-commercial revenue
- Valuation stretched vs revenue
- Lithium extraction competitive
- Nuclear timeline long (2029)
- Isotope separation unproven at scale

**Note:** Available via Reg A crowdfunding at ~$9.50/share ($600M valuation historically), but recent rounds at ~$2B.
