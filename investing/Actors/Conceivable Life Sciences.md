**Conceivable Life Sciences** — NY-based startup building AI-powered robotic IVF labs. AURA system automates all steps of embryo creation outside the body.

---

## Technology

### AURA system
- 17-foot-long, 4,500-pound robotic assembly line
- 6 stations with robot arms for pipettes and petri dishes
- Tracks/selects sperm, singles out eggs, merges to create zygote
- Incubates zygote → embryo → blastocyst

**Key innovations:**
| Step | Manual | AURA |
|------|--------|------|
| Sperm separation | Centrifuge (100 Gs, DNA fragmentation risk) | Swim through microfluidic maze |
| Sperm selection | Random pick + tail thwack | Algorithm selection + laser stun |
| Egg finding | Embryologist searches goop | AI (adapted from Baidu) |
| Fertilization | Manual needle puncture | Ultrasonic drill + self-driving car guidance |
| Freezing | Human plunge (ice crystals) | 10x faster plunge (10x fewer crystals) |

**Precision:** 30 adjustments/second, 1/1000 mm resolution

## Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Babies born | 19 | As of Jan 2026 |
| Blastocyst rate | 51% | Matches top human labs |
| First US baby | Sept 2025 | Ho/Hermann (investor) |

## Funding history

| Round | Date | Amount | Lead | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Seed | Dec 2022 | — | Acme Capital | Aike Ho wrote first check |
| Series A | 2024 | $20M | — | For human trials |
| Series B | Sept 2025 | — | Advance Venture Partners | Closed week of Abram's death |

**Total raised:** $70M

## Key investors

| Investor | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Acme Capital** | Seed lead, board seat (Aike Ho) |
| **Advance Venture Partners** | Series B lead |

## Leadership

| Role | Name | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| Chairman | Joshua Abram | Co-founder, ex-adtech (Integral Ad Science, Dstillery). Died Sept 2025 (cancer) |
| CEO | Alan Murray | Co-founder, ex-adtech. Operator to Abram's storyteller |
| CMO | Alejandro Chavez-Badiola | Reproductive endocrinologist. Runs Hope IVF (Mexico City). First 3-parent embryo (2016) |

**Prior companies:**
- TMRW Life Sciences — digitized egg/embryo storage (Abram/Murray)
- IVF 2.0 — AI algorithms for embryology (Chavez-Badiola)

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Conceivable** | Leading | 19 babies, $70M raised, US launch 2026 |
| Overture Life | Pivoted | $71M+ raised. Pivoted to egg-freezing device |
| Oma Fertility | Shut down | $71M raised, wound down 2023 |
| Gameto | Active | Egg maturation device (reduces hormone injections) |

---

## Market context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global fertility market | $64B (2024) → $126B (2029) |
| US reproductive endocrinologists | ~2,000 |
| US embryologists | ~2,000 |
| US obstetricians | 38,000 |
| IVF live birth rate | 37.5% (CDC 2022) |
| IVF cycle cost (US) | Up to $30,000 |

**Demand drivers:** Declining birth rates, dropping sperm counts, later parenthood, employer coverage expansion

---

## Vision

- **Superlabs:** 1 embryologist + 2 technicians → thousands of embryos/day
- **Target:** 5% of global fertility market
- **Abram's dying wish:** 65% of all IVF births from Conceivable

---

## Regulatory

- No FDA approval needed — uses existing FDA-authorized components (pipettes, dishes, chemicals)
- Robots are "two degrees removed" from gametes
- Human trials conducted in Mexico (fertility treatment is standard care there)
- US launch planned: 2026

---

## Risks

- Clinics may pocket savings rather than pass to patients
- Embryologists resist automation (job loss fears)
- Shipping gametes/embryos to superlabs = transport/thaw risks
- Errors could replicate at scale
- "Loss of human control over procreation" concerns
