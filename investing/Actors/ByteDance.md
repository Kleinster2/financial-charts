**ByteDance** — TikTok parent. China's largest AI infrastructure spender. $14B NVIDIA order.

---

## Why ByteDance matters

ByteDance is a stealth AI hyperscaler — spending rivals US big tech:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2026 NVIDIA order | $14B (H200s, HBM3E 8Hi) |
| AI models | Doubao (Chinese GPT competitor) |
| Products | TikTok, Douyin, Lark, CapCut |
| Valuation | ~$300B (private) |

---

## GPU spending

**$14B NVIDIA order (2026):**
- Largest single Chinese AI chip order
- H200 GPUs (export-compliant version)
- HBM3E 8Hi memory
- [[Shipping]] before Lunar New Year 2026

**Context:**
- Rivals Meta, Microsoft, Google in AI spend
- But Chinese — subject to export controls
- H200 is "previous gen" (Blackwell unavailable to China)

---

## AI capabilities

**Doubao (豆包):**
- ByteDance's LLM
- Competes with [[Baidu]] [[Ernie]], Alibaba [[Qwen]]
- Powers TikTok recommendation algorithms
- Available via API in China

**AI applications:**
- TikTok/Douyin recommendation (world's best?)
- Video generation
- Translation
- Content moderation at scale

---

## TikTok situation

**US ban/divestiture:**
- US law requires divestiture or ban
- Multiple deadline extensions
- ByteDance refuses to sell
- Supreme Court upheld ban (Jan 2025)
- Enforcement uncertain under Trump

**If banned:**
- Loses US market (~170M users)
- But core business is China (Douyin)
- AI infrastructure investment continues regardless

---

## Export control implications

**What ByteDance can buy:**
- H200 (approved Dec 2025)
- Older NVIDIA GPUs
- [[AMD]] MI series

**What ByteDance can't buy:**
- Blackwell (B200) — banned
- Rubin (future) — will be banned
- EUV-manufactured chips from [[TSMC]]

**The gap:** ByteDance training on H200 while US competitors use Blackwell. Performance disadvantage grows over time.

## Competitive position

**Vs US hyperscalers:**
| Company | AI Capex | Best GPU access |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | $50B+ | Blackwell |
| [[Meta]] | $40B+ | Blackwell |
| [[Google]] | $40B+ | Blackwell + TPUs |
| **ByteDance** | ~$15B+ | H200 (gen behind) |

**Vs Chinese competitors:**
| Company | Position |
|---------|----------|
| **ByteDance** | Largest AI spend |
| Alibaba | Cloud + [[Qwen]] models |
| [[Baidu]] | [[Ernie]], autonomous driving |
| [[Tencent]] | [[Gaming]] AI, WeChat |

ByteDance is \#1 in China AI infrastructure.

## Ownership / Cap table

**Private company** — not publicly traded.

| Stakeholder | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Zhang Yiming | Founder, stepped back from CEO |
| Liang Rubo | CEO |
| Employees | Significant equity |
| [[HongShan]] | Early investor (formerly Sequoia China) |
| [[General Atlantic]] | Investor |
| [[SoftBank]] | Investor |
| [[KKR]] | Investor |
| Various VCs | $8B+ raised historically |

**Valuation:** ~$300B (secondary market, fluctuates with TikTok news)

---

## Memory demand

ByteDance's AI buildout drives memory demand:
- HBM3E for H200 GPUs → [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]]
- Server DRAM → all memory makers
- SSD/NAND for data storage

Contributes to [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]].

## Seedance 2.0 IP controversy (Feb 2026)

[[Seedance]] 2.0 launched Feb 10, 2026 and immediately went viral generating Hollywood-quality video from simple text prompts — including copyrighted characters (Spider-Man, Star Wars, Marvel) and celebrity likenesses (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt):

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 10 | Seedance 2.0 limited beta launch |
| Feb 11 | Viral Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt fight clip; Deadpool writer Rhett Reese: "It's likely over for us" |
| Feb 13 | [[Disney]] cease-and-desist — called it "virtual smash-and-grab" of Disney IP |
| Feb 13 | [[SAG-AFTRA]] condemned "blatant infringement" of member likenesses |
| Feb 13 | [[MPA]] accused ByteDance of "massive scale" unauthorized use of US IP |
| Feb 14 | [[Paramount Global]] cease-and-desist |

**Irony:** ByteDance's Seedance pirates American IP while its [[TikTok]] US operations run on [[Oracle]] infrastructure — and Oracle's founder [[Larry Ellison]] is backing his son [[David Ellison]]'s acquisition of the very studios whose IP is being pirated.

## Risks / Considerations

- TikTok ban reduces US revenue/influence
- Export controls limit GPU access
- Chinese regulatory risk (tech crackdowns)
- Private — can't invest directly
- Geopolitical pawn in US-China tensions

## For theses

**[[Long memory]]:** ByteDance = massive [[HBM]]/DRAM demand
**[[Long TSMC]]:** Indirectly via NVIDIA GPU demand
**[[Export controls]]:** Example of controlled Chinese buyer
