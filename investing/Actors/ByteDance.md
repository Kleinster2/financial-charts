ByteDance — [[TikTok]] parent. China's largest AI infrastructure spender. $14B [[NVIDIA]] order.

---

## Why ByteDance matters

ByteDance is a stealth AI hyperscaler — spending rivals US big tech:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2026 NVIDIA order | $14B (H200s, HBM3E 8Hi) |
| AI models | [[Doubao]] (Chinese [[GPT]] competitor) |
| Products | [[TikTok]], [[Douyin]], Lark, [[CapCut]] |
| Valuation | ~$300B–$480B (private, secondary market) |
| 2024 Revenue | $155B (+29% YoY) |
| 2024 Net profit | ~$33B (est.) |
| Employees | ~120,000 (2025) |

---

## Financials

ByteDance is the world's most valuable private company. Revenue surpassed [[Meta]]'s in 2024:

| Year | Revenue | Growth | Net Profit (est.) |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 2022 | ~$80B | — | — |
| 2023 | ~$120B | ~50% | — |
| 2024 | $155B | +29% | ~$33B |

Revenue breakdown (2024 est.): ~75% China ([[Douyin]], Toutiao), ~25% international ([[TikTok]]). [[TikTok]] drove most of the growth as China's economy slowed. Valuation range $300B–$480B on secondary markets ([[CB Insights]]: $480B as of late 2025).

---

## GPU spending

$14B NVIDIA order (2026):
- Largest single Chinese AI chip order
- [[H200]] GPUs (export-compliant version)
- HBM3E 8Hi memory
- [[Shipping]] before Lunar New Year 2026

Context:
- Rivals [[Meta]], [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] in AI spend
- But Chinese — subject to [[Export controls]]
- [[H200]] is "previous gen" ([[Blackwell]] unavailable to China)

---

## AI capabilities

[[Doubao]] (豆包):
- ByteDance's LLM
- Competes with [[Baidu]] [[Ernie]], [[Alibaba]] [[Qwen]]
- Powers [[TikTok]] recommendation algorithms
- Available via API in China

AI applications:
- [[TikTok]]/[[Douyin]] recommendation (world's best?)
- Video generation ([[Seedance]])
- Translation
- Content moderation at scale

---

## TikTok situation

US ban/divestiture:
- US law requires divestiture or ban
- Multiple deadline extensions
- ByteDance refuses to sell
- Supreme Court upheld ban (Jan 2025)
- Enforcement uncertain under Trump

If banned:
- Loses US market (~170M users)
- But core business is China ([[Douyin]])
- AI infrastructure investment continues regardless

---

## Export control implications

What ByteDance can buy:
- [[H200]] (approved Dec 2025)
- Older [[NVIDIA]] GPUs
- [[AMD]] MI series

What ByteDance can't buy:
- [[Blackwell]] ([[B200]]) — banned
- Rubin (future) — will be banned
- EUV-manufactured chips from [[TSMC]]

The gap: ByteDance training on [[H200]] while US competitors use [[Blackwell]]. Performance disadvantage grows over time.

## Competitive position

Vs US hyperscalers:

| Company | AI Capex | Best GPU access |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | $50B+ | Blackwell |
| [[Meta]] | $40B+ | Blackwell |
| [[Google]] | $40B+ | Blackwell + TPUs |
| ByteDance | ~$15B+ | [[H200]] (gen behind) |

Vs Chinese competitors:

| Company | Position |
|---------|----------|
| ByteDance | Largest AI spend |
| [[Alibaba]] | Cloud + [[Qwen]] models |
| [[Baidu]] | [[Ernie]], autonomous driving |
| [[Tencent]] | [[Gaming]] AI, WeChat |

ByteDance is \#1 in China AI infrastructure.

## Memory demand

ByteDance's AI buildout drives memory demand:
- HBM3E for H200 GPUs → [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]]
- Server DRAM → all memory makers
- SSD/NAND for data storage

Contributes to [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]].

## Seedance 2.0 IP controversy (Feb 2026)

[[Seedance]] 2.0 launched Feb 10, 2026 and immediately went viral generating Hollywood-quality video from simple text prompts — including copyrighted characters (Spider-Man, Star Wars, Marvel) and celebrity likenesses (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt):

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 10 | Seedance 2.0 limited beta launch |
| Feb 11 | Viral Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt fight clip; Deadpool writer Rhett Reese: "It's likely over for us" |
| Feb 13 | [[Disney]] cease-and-desist — called it "virtual smash-and-grab" of Disney IP |
| Feb 13 | [[SAG-AFTRA]] condemned "blatant infringement" of member likenesses |
| Feb 13 | [[MPA]] accused ByteDance of "massive scale" unauthorized use of US IP |
| Feb 14 | [[Paramount Global]] cease-and-desist |

On Feb 16, ByteDance issued a statement saying it "respects intellectual property rights" and will strengthen safeguards ([[Thomson Reuters|Reuters]], [[BBC]]). Whether this is substantive or cosmetic remains to be seen.

Irony: ByteDance's [[Seedance]] pirates American IP while its [[TikTok]] US operations run on [[Oracle]] infrastructure — and Oracle's founder [[Larry Ellison]] is backing his son [[David Ellison]]'s acquisition of the very studios whose IP is being pirated. See [[Ellison AI-IP vertical integration]].

## Risks / Considerations

- TikTok ban reduces US revenue/influence
- Export controls limit GPU access
- Chinese regulatory risk (tech crackdowns)
- Private — can't invest directly
- Geopolitical pawn in US-China tensions
