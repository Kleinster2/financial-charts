**Nelson Tanure** — Brazil's most prominent distressed-asset investor. Built [[PRIO]] from a bankrupt shell into a R$38B oil company, then saw his empire unravel in 2025-2026 as cross-collateralized leverage cascaded and the [[Banco Master]] scandal drew federal police raids.

## Investment style

Tanure is a turnaround / distressed specialist — Brazilian press calls him "devorador de empresas" (company devourer). The playbook:

- Acquires companies in deep financial or operational distress, often in judicial recovery
- Uses complex fund structures (FIPs, offshore vehicles) to build positions opaquely
- Takes board seats, pushes governance changes, negotiates aggressively with creditors
- Heavy use of cross-collateralization — shares in one company pledged as collateral for loans to acquire another
- No single-sector focus: energy, telecom, healthcare, real estate, retail, petrochemicals — follows distress wherever it appears

The cross-collateral structure is the key risk: when one position deteriorates, creditors can seize shares across the entire portfolio. This is exactly what happened in 2025-2026.

## Evolution

- 1977 — Started in real estate (Cinasa) alongside his father in Salvador
- 1980s — Founded Sequip, an engineering services company focused on petroleum; first exposure to oil sector
- 1994 — Acquired Verolme shipyard from bankruptcy; later fined R$130M by [[CVM]] for diverting cash to other Tanure-controlled entities (reduced to R$16.2M on appeal)
- 2013 — Acquired controlling stake in HRT Participacoes, a bankrupt oil explorer. Renamed PetroRio (2015), then [[PRIO]] (2022). Transformed it into Brazil's largest independent oil producer. By far his most successful investment
- 2016 — Entered [[Oi]] during its R$64.5B judicial recovery — one of Brazil's largest ever. Built position, later exited
- 2023 — Built 15-21.8% position in [[Light SA]] right before its judicial recovery filing. Elected to board (Jul 2023)
- 2024 Q2-Q3 — Won EMAE privatization auction via Fundo Phoenix; expanded [[Light SA]] position
- 2024 Q4 — Acquired Dia Brasil supermarkets; built 9% GPA stake; laid groundwork for Dia-GPA merger
- 2025 H1 — Hired [[Rothschild & Co]] to structure bid for [[Novonor]]'s controlling stake in [[Braskem]]. [[CADE]] pre-approved the structure
- 2025 H2 — [[Braskem]] exclusivity expired without deal. Lost EMAE to creditors (sold to [[Sabesp]]). [[Banco Master]] scandal erupts (Nov 2025 — bank liquidated, CEO [[Daniel Vorcaro]] arrested)
- Jan 14, 2026 — Federal Police launch Operation Compliance Zero Phase 2: 42 warrants executed, R$5.7B (~$1.1B) asset freeze sought. Forced sale of [[PRIO]] stake to pay creditors
- Feb 8, 2026 — Creditors ([[BTG Pactual]], [[Santander]], [[Farallon Capital]], Prisma) execute collateral on Ligga Telecom loan (~R$1.2B), seizing shares in Allianca Saude and [[Light SA]]

## Banco Master connection

The [[Banco Master]] collapse (Nov 2025) is the thread that unraveled the empire:

- Federal Police identified Tanure as "socio oculto" (hidden partner) of [[Banco Master]]
- Allegedly contributed R$2.5B over four years via offshore funds (e.g., Stockholm fund)
- Used MAM Asset ([[Daniel Vorcaro]]'s fund manager) for acquisitions including Copel Telecom (R$2.5B) and the EMAE privatization
- [[CVM]] report found "coordinated" action between Tanure and Master to inflate [[Ambipar]] shares (+700%)
- Tanure denies ownership; prosecutors allege he used intermediary funds and companies to hide control
- Investigated for: criminal organization, fraudulent financial institution management, market manipulation, money laundering
- Estimated R$41B loss to Brazil's deposit insurance fund (FGC) — the largest ever

Tanure's fiscal domicile was changed; business conducted through Trustee Holding Financeira, which operates as if representing an anonymous foreign investor in [[Brazil]]. Appeared in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database.

## Assessment

Tanure's career is a study in the power and fragility of cross-collateralized distressed investing. The [[PRIO]] transformation — bankrupt shell to R$38B independent oil producer — is one of the great value-creation stories in Brazilian markets. But the same leverage and opacity that enabled rapid empire-building became the mechanism of its destruction. Once the [[Banco Master]] scandal triggered scrutiny and creditor nervousness, the cross-collateral chain snapped link by link: EMAE → [[PRIO]] → Allianca → [[Light SA]].

As of February 2026, Tanure is under active criminal investigation with the bulk of his public equity positions seized or sold. The Dia-GPA retail merger and [[Gafisa]] position remain in limbo.
