## Investment style

Tanure is a turnaround / distressed specialist — Brazilian press calls him "devorador de empresas" (company devourer). The playbook:

- Acquires companies in deep financial or operational distress, often in judicial recovery
- Uses complex fund structures (FIPs, offshore vehicles) to build positions opaquely
- Takes board seats, pushes governance changes, negotiates aggressively with creditors
- Heavy use of cross-collateralization — shares in one company pledged as collateral for loans to acquire another
- No single-sector focus: energy, telecom, healthcare, real estate, retail, petrochemicals — follows distress wherever it appears

Cross-collateralization means that when one position deteriorates, creditors can seize shares across the entire portfolio. In 2025-2026, creditors executed these guarantees across multiple holdings.

## Evolution

- 1951 — Born in Salvador, Bahia. Father Lebanese merchant (surname traces to Tannourine, Lebanon), mother Brazilian
- Late 1970s — Started at Cinasa, a construction company linked to Pik, which collapsed amid mortgage fraud and embezzlement scandals. Tanure spent a period in France during the fallout
- Late 1970s-80s — Moved to Rio de Janeiro. Founded Sequip (petroleum engineering services). Acquired distressed companies across SEIP, SAD (industry), Companhia Docas (ports), and Verolme (shipbuilding). At peak, controlled ~80% of Brazilian shipyard capacity
- 1994 — Acquired Verolme shipyard from bankruptcy; later fined R$130M by [[CVM]] for diverting cash to other Tanure-controlled entities (reduced to R$16.2M on appeal)
- 2008 — Acquired Intelig Telecom for R$10M, assuming R$130M in debt. ~15 months later, sold to [[TIM Brasil]] for ~R$650M in shares. TIM tried to block his position in court over legacy debts — Tanure countersued, kept the shares and the company's Botafogo headquarters building
- 2013 — Acquired controlling stake in HRT Participacoes (bankrupt oil explorer valued below its cash). Fought American hedge funds for control. Renamed PetroRio (2015), then [[PRIO]] (2022). Grew into a ~R$35B oil company — 117x return
- 2016 — Entered [[Oi]] during its R$64.5B judicial recovery — one of Brazil's largest ever. Built position, later exited
- 2018+ — Diversified into healthcare ([[Alianca Saude]]), retail ([[Supermercados Dia]], GPA), energy (EMAE, [[Light SA]]), real estate ([[Gafisa]]), telecom ([[Ligga Telecom]]). Financed primarily through cross-collateralized leverage. [[Banco Master]] provided financing for multiple acquisitions
- 2020 — Acquired Copel Telecom (renamed [[Ligga Telecom]]) for ~R$2.5B, issuing R$1.5B in debt with cross-portfolio collateral
- 2023 — Built 15-21.8% position in [[Light SA]] right before its judicial recovery filing. Elected to board (Jul 2023)
- 2024 Q2-Q3 — Won EMAE privatization auction via Fundo Phoenix; expanded [[Light SA]] position
- 2024 Q4 — Acquired [[Supermercados Dia|Dia Brasil]]; built 9% GPA stake; laid groundwork for Dia-GPA merger
- 2025 H1 — Hired [[Rothschild & Co]] to structure bid for [[Novonor]]'s controlling stake in [[Braskem]]. [[CADE]] pre-approved the structure
- 2025 H2 — [[Braskem]] exclusivity expired without deal. Lost EMAE to creditors (sold to [[Sabesp]]). [[Banco Master]] liquidated by Central Bank (Nov 2025); CEO [[Daniel Vorcaro]] arrested. Cash held in Master CDBs by Tanure's portfolio companies frozen
- Jan 14, 2026 — Federal Police launch Operation Compliance Zero Phase 2: 42 warrants executed, R$5.7B (~$1.1B) asset freeze sought. Forced sale of [[PRIO]] stake to pay creditors
- Feb 7, 2026 — Creditors ([[BTG Pactual]], [[Santander]], [[Farallon Capital]], Prisma) execute collateral on [[Ligga Telecom]] loan (~R$1.3B outstanding — principal repaid but accrued interest unpaid), seizing shares in [[Alianca Saude]] and [[Light SA]]

## Banco Master connection

Alleged circular liquidity mechanism (per PF investigation and press reports; Tanure denies): Master financed Tanure's acquisitions (loans or guarantees). The acquired companies then placed operating cash in Master CDBs. This is documented in [[Supermercados Dia]] (restructuring capital → CDBs), [[Ligga Telecom]], EMAE, and [[Alianca Saude]]. When the Central Bank liquidated Master (Nov 2025), cash held in these CDBs was frozen.

Criminal investigation:
- Federal Police identified Tanure as "socio oculto" (hidden partner) of [[Banco Master]]
- Allegedly contributed R$2.5B over four years via offshore funds (e.g., Stockholm fund)
- Used MAM Asset ([[Daniel Vorcaro]]'s fund manager) for acquisitions including [[Ligga Telecom|Copel Telecom]] (R$2.5B) and the EMAE privatization
- [[CVM]] report found "coordinated" action between Tanure and Master to inflate [[Ambipar]] shares (+700%)
- Tanure denies ownership; prosecutors allege he used intermediary funds and companies to hide control
- Investigated for: criminal organization, fraudulent financial institution management, market manipulation, money laundering
- Estimated R$41B loss to Brazil's deposit insurance fund (FGC) — the largest ever
- PF investigating fortune of hundreds of millions hidden in European tax havens via Trust Holding (offshore vehicle)

Tanure's fiscal domicile was changed; business conducted through Trustee Holding Financeira (controlled by Mauricio Quadrado), which operates as if representing an anonymous foreign investor in [[Brazil]]. Appeared in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database.

## Status (Feb 2026)

Under active criminal investigation (Operation Compliance Zero). Bulk of public equity positions seized or sold by creditors. [[PRIO]] operates independently under son's leadership. [[Ligga Telecom]] sale to Brasil Tech in negotiation. [[Supermercados Dia|Dia]]-GPA merger and [[Gafisa]] position unresolved.

Open questions:
- Whether the Banco Master relationship constituted hidden ownership or standard client-bank dealings — PF alleges the former, Tanure denies
- Whether the diversification portfolio (Ligga, Alianca, Light, Dia) had viable standalone business cases independent of the leverage structure
- Scale and legality of offshore holdings

## Analysis

The track record splits cleanly into two phases with different structures. The early deals (shipyards, Intelig, PRIO) share a pattern: Tanure bought assets valued below their tangible worth, used operational or legal leverage to extract value, and the upside came from the asset itself. PRIO's 117x return was built on production growth from acquired mature fields — real barrels, real revenue.

The post-2018 portfolio has a different structure. Nine acquisitions across six unrelated sectors in roughly six years, financed through cross-collateralized debt rather than operating cash flow. The portfolio table shows no exit or value realization from any of the diversification-phase holdings — every one is either seized, under investigation, or unresolved. Whether this reflects bad timing (Master's liquidation as exogenous shock) or structural unsoundness (a leverage architecture that required continuous access to credit) is the central question the open investigation may answer.

Two facts sit in tension. The CVM fined Tanure R$130M in the 1990s for diverting cash between controlled entities — the same pattern the PF now alleges with Banco Master. That's a four-decade gap with the same allegation. At the same time, PRIO — the one holding where Tanure had the longest runway and deepest operational involvement — is a legitimate, functioning company producing 155,000 boepd. The investor who built PRIO and the investor under investigation for the Master scheme are the same person.

The cross-collateral structure is worth noting mechanically: it made the entire portfolio path-dependent on the weakest link. Once any single creditor executed, the collateral seizures propagated to every other holding. This is not a judgment on whether it was reckless — it's a description of how a portfolio of otherwise unrelated companies could unravel simultaneously from a single debt default.
