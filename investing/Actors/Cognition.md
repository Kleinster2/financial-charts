## Product: Devin

**"AI software engineer":**
- Autonomous coding agent
- Plans, writes, tests, deploys
- Not just autocomplete — full tasks
- Can work independently for hours

**Different from [[Cursor]]:**
- [[Cursor]] = AI-assisted IDE (human in loop)
- Devin = AI agent (autonomous)

## Enterprise customers

**Blue-chip adoption:**
- [[Goldman Sachs]]
- Citi
- [[Dell]]
- [[Cisco]]
- [[Ramp]]
- [[Palantir]]
- [[Nubank]]

## Semiconductor relevance

**High compute intensity:**
- Autonomous agents need massive inference
- Long-running tasks = sustained GPU usage
- Enterprise scale = significant demand

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Best team (IOI winners)
