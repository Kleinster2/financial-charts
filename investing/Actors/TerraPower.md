## Why TerraPower matters

TerraPower has the most high-profile backing and a concrete construction project:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Founder | [[Bill Gates]] |
| Design | Natrium (sodium-cooled) |
| First plant | Kemmerer, Wyoming |
| Timeline | [[Target]] late 2020s |
| Capacity | 345 MW (500 MW peak with storage) |

---

## Natrium design

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Coolant | Liquid sodium |
| Fuel | HALEU (high-assay) |
| Storage | Integrated molten salt |
| Peak capacity | 500 MW (vs 345 MW base) |
| Passive safety | No water, no steam explosions |

**Unique feature**: Built-in molten salt thermal storage allows output to ramp from 345 MW to 500 MW for grid peaks. Bridges baseload and peaking.

## Kemmerer project

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Kemmerer, Wyoming |
| Site | Former coal plant |
| DOE funding | $2B+ |
| Ground broken | 2024 |
| [[Target]] operation | Late 2020s |

Converting coal country to nuclear — politically significant.

## Cap table / Investors

| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| Series A-C | 2008-2020 | $500M+ | — |
| Recent | 2022-2024 | $500M+ | ~$4B+ |
| **Total** | | **$1B+** | |

**Key investors:**

| Investor | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| [[Bill Gates]] | Founder, $1B+ personal |
| SK Group | Korean strategic |
| DOE | $2B+ ARDP funding |
| Various VCs | Growth |

**Total raised:** $1B+ (private) + $2B+ (DOE grants)

## Bill Gates involvement

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Founded | 2008 |
| Investment | $1B+ personal |
| Involvement | Active chairman |
| Vision | Nuclear for climate |

Gates has called nuclear essential for decarbonization.

## HALEU dependency

TerraPower's Natrium requires HALEU fuel:
- Only [[Centrus Energy]] produces in US
- [[Russia]] was main supplier (now sanctioned)
- DOE accelerating domestic HALEU

This is a supply chain bottleneck for all advanced reactors.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Total raised | $1B+ |
| Gates investment | $1B+ personal |
| DOE funding | $2B+ |
| Valuation | $4B+ (estimated) |
| Revenue | $0 (pre-commercial) |
| First plant target | Late 2020s |

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Gates backing and capital
- DOE support ($2B+)
- Concrete project underway
- Storage integration unique

**Bear:**
- Private (can't invest directly)
- HALEU supply constraint
- First-of-kind risk
- Sodium coolant complexity
