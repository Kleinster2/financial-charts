## Why Diraq matters

**Silicon + CMOS = scalability thesis.** Unlike superconducting or photonic approaches requiring specialized manufacturing, Diraq's qubits use modified silicon transistors — manufacturable in existing semiconductor fabs. If it works, quantum computers become a chip packaging problem, not a physics problem.

**September 2025 milestone:** Imec-fabricated devices achieved >99% two-qubit gate fidelity — exceeding error correction threshold. This is the proof point that industrial manufacturing can produce quantum-grade silicon.

## Technology

**Silicon spin qubits:**
- Electrons trapped in quantum dots on silicon
- Spin state = qubit (up/down)
- Operates at ~1K (warmer than superconducting but still needs cooling)
- **Key advantage:** Uses standard CMOS processes

**Manufacturing partner:** [[imec]] (Belgium) — demonstrated industrial fabrication with >99% fidelity.

**Why it matters:** If quantum computers can be made in existing fabs, the scaling bottleneck disappears. No need for exotic materials or custom facilities.

## Government & defense contracts

| Program | Value | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **DARPA QBI Stage A** | Up to $300M (later stages) | Awarded April 2025 |
| NSW QCCF (with Q-CTRL) | Multi-project | Active |
| US Army Research Office | Research grant | Active |

DARPA QBI validates Diraq's approach for utility-scale quantum by 2033.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | vs Diraq |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [[Intel]] | Silicon spin | Competitor (same physics) |
| [[PsiQuantum]] | Photonic | Different physics, same CMOS fab advantage |
| [[IBM]]/[[Google]] | Superconducting | Different physics |
| SQC (Australia) | Silicon | Competitor (also DARPA QBI awardee) |

**Diraq differentiation:** imec partnership proves industrial manufacturability. Intel also pursues silicon qubits but hasn't demonstrated same fidelity at fab scale.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| >99% two-qubit fidelity | September 2025 ✓ |
| First commercial system | 2029 |
| Utility-scale | 2033 |

## Investment implications

**Private company** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[imec]] partnership (not public)
- [[Main Sequence]] portfolio (CSIRO fund)
- Watch for future funding rounds or IPO

**Watch for:**
- DARPA QBI progression to later stages ($300M potential)
- [[Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park]] presence
- Intel silicon qubit progress (competitive benchmark)
