**Voltage Park** — GPU cloud startup backed by Crusoe founders. Crypto-to-AI pivot heritage. Building AI compute infrastructure.

---

## Why Voltage Park matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Focus | GPU cloud infrastructure |
| Heritage | Crypto mining → AI compute |
| Backing | Well-funded |
| Competitors | [[CoreWeave]], [[Lambda Labs]], [[Nebius]] |

---

## Business model

**GPU-as-a-service:**
- NVIDIA GPU clusters (H100, etc.)
- AI training and inference
- Competing on price vs hyperscalers
- Target: AI startups, enterprises

---

## Crypto-to-AI lineage

**Pattern:** Crypto mining infrastructure → AI compute

| Company | Pivot |
|---------|-------|
| **Voltage Park** | Crypto founders → GPU cloud |
| [[CoreWeave]] | Crypto mining → AI cloud leader |
| [[Crusoe Energy]] | Flare gas crypto → AI compute |
| [[Hut 8]], [[IREN]] | Bitcoin mining → AI infrastructure |

**Why it works:** Same skills — procuring GPUs, building data centers, managing power.

---

## Competitive positioning

| Player | Differentiator |
|--------|----------------|
| Voltage Park | Price, availability |
| [[CoreWeave]] | Scale leader, NVIDIA partnership |
| [[Lambda Labs]] | Developer experience |
| [[Nebius]] | European focus |
| Hyperscalers | Full stack but expensive |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- GPU demand exceeds supply
- Cheaper than hyperscalers
- Experienced infrastructure team
- AI compute secular growth

**Bear:**
- Crowded market
- CoreWeave has scale lead
- Hyperscaler competition
- GPU procurement challenges

---

## Cap table / Investors

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Funding | Undisclosed |
| Backers | Crypto/infra veterans |

**Known connections:**
- Crusoe Energy founders involved
- Crypto mining infrastructure expertise
- Likely VC-backed given GPU capex needs

**Note:** Limited public funding disclosure. Crypto-to-AI pivots often self-funded initially from mining profits.
