## What It Tracks

The Russell 2000 — small-cap US stocks. No single holding exceeds 0.5%. Much more diversified and domestically-focused than [[SPY]] or [[QQQ]].

## Characteristics

- **Rate sensitive** — small-caps carry more floating-rate debt, so [[Federal Reserve]] policy hits harder
- **Domestic revenue** — ~80% US revenue vs ~60% for S&P 500
- **More volatile** — beta ~1.3 vs S&P 500
- **Value tilt** — more financials, industrials, healthcare; less tech

## Use Case

Small-cap / risk appetite gauge. IWM vs [[SPY]] spread signals risk-on/risk-off. When IWM leads, breadth is improving. When it lags, mega-cap concentration is driving the market.
