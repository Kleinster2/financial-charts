## Why Digital Realty matters

Digital Realty is the #2 data center REIT, focused on larger deployments:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~$50B+ |
| Data centers | 300+ facilities |
| Footprint | 25+ countries |
| Model | Wholesale + hyperscale |

---

## Business model

**Wholesale colocation:**
- Large deployments (megawatts, not racks)
- Fewer, larger customers
- Hyperscaler focus
- Build-to-suit capabilities

**Contrast with [[Equinix]]:**
- Equinix = retail colo + interconnection
- Digital Realty = wholesale + hyperscale
- Less interconnection revenue
- More AI-relevant (power density)

---

## AI exposure

**Better positioned than Equinix for AI:**
- Wholesale model = higher power density
- Hyperscaler relationships
- Build-to-suit for AI workloads
- Land bank for expansion

**Hyperscaler customers:**
- Major cloud providers
- AI companies
- Enterprise at scale

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus | DLR advantage |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| [[Equinix]] | Interconnection | Wholesale scale |
