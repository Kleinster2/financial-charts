## Helix AI model

Helix (Feb 2025): generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that unifies perception, language understanding, and learned control. 35 degrees of freedom continuous upper-body control. Generates long-horizon, collaborative, dexterous manipulation without task-specific demonstrations or manual programming.

Helix accelerated the home alpha-testing timeline by two years — originally planned for 2027, started late 2025.

---

## OpenAI partnership

[[OpenAI]] models for reasoning, multimodal understanding, natural language commands. GPT-powered robots. See also [[Physical Intelligence]] — competitor in embodied AI.

## Robot generations

### Figure 03 (Oct 2025)

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Target | Home/consumer |
| Vision | 2x frame rate, ¼ latency, 60% wider FOV |
| Design | Complete hardware/software redesign from Figure 02 learnings |
| Manufacturing | Designed for mass production (12,000 units/year target) |
| Materials | Soft materials, foam coverings, washable textiles, wireless charging |
| Recognition | TIME Best Inventions 2025 |

Alpha testing in real homes began late 2025 — two years ahead of original timeline, enabled by Helix breakthroughs.

### Figure 02

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Height | 5'6" |
| Weight | ~130 lbs |
| Payload | 45 lbs |
| Speed | 2.5 mph |
| Battery | 5+ hours |
| [[Target]] | Industrial/manufacturing |

## [[BMW]] deployment (concluded)

11-month deployment at Spartanburg, SC — completed and robots retired:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Runtime | 1,250+ hours |
| Parts loaded | 90,000+ sheet-metal parts |
| Vehicles produced | 30,000+ BMW X3s |
| Shift length | 10 hours daily |
| Task | Sheet-metal loading (pick-and-place onto welding fixtures) |
| Status | Concluded (robots retired) |

Key hardware learnings: forearm emerged as main failure point — complexity of packing 3 DOF, thermal management, and cabling into human-sized limb stressed microcontrollers and wiring. Figure 03 redesign eliminated distribution board and dynamic cabling in wrist; motor controllers now communicate directly with main computer.

---

## UPS (reported)

Reportedly Figure AI's second major commercial customer after [[BMW]]. Logistics applications — parcel sorting and package handling. Details not officially confirmed.

---

## Business model

[[Robots as a Service|Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS)]]:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Pricing | ~$1,000/month per robot |
| Includes | Hardware, software updates, maintenance, support |
| Model | Subscription vs. upfront purchase |

Target markets:
1. Manufacturing ([[BMW]] — concluded, seeking next)
2. Warehouse/logistics (reportedly [[UPS]])
3. Consumer/home (Figure 03 alpha testing)

---

## Competition

| Company | Robot | Status | Valuation/Funding |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Figure AI | Figure 03 | Home alpha testing | $39B / $2.34B raised |
| [[Boston Dynamics]] | Atlas | Production 2026 | [[Hyundai]] subsidiary |
| [[Tesla]] | Optimus | Pilot deployments | Tesla subsidiary |
| [[Apptronik]] | Apollo | Development | $5.3B / $935M raised |
| [[1X Technologies]] | NEO | Pre-orders ($20K) | $480M (targeting $10B+) |
| [[Agility Robotics]] | Digit | Deployed ([[GXO Logistics|GXO]]) | $2.1B / $640M raised |
| [[Reflex Robotics]] | Wheeled humanoid | [[GXO Logistics|GXO]] pilot | $7M raised |
| [[Unitree]] | G1/H1 | Shipping | Private |

Figure AI advantage: best-funded pure-play, [[OpenAI]] partnership, proven [[BMW]] deployment (concluded), Helix VLA model, consumer pivot with Figure 03.

## Investment case

Bull:
- $39B valuation — most valuable humanoid startup
- [[OpenAI]] partnership = differentiated intelligence
- [[BMW]] deployment proven (1,250+ hours, 90K parts, 30K vehicles)
- Helix VLA model — generalist AI without task-specific programming
- Figure 03 opens consumer TAM (alpha testing 2 years ahead of plan)
- Elite investor syndicate (113 investors)
- [[Robots as a Service|RaaS]] model = recurring revenue

Bear:
- Private — no public access
- [[Tesla Optimus]] competition (scale advantage)
- BMW deployment concluded — need next major customer
- Hardware manufacturing challenges (forearm failures at BMW)
- Consumer robotics unproven market
- High burn rate at $39B valuation
