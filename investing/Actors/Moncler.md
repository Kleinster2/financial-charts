## Why Moncler matters

**Remo Ruffini's transformation:**
- Bought bankrupt Moncler (2003) for ~€40M
- Repositioned from ski brand to year-round luxury
- Built to €3B+ revenue, ~€16B market cap
- Invented "Moncler Genius" — collaborative collections with designers
- Acquired Stone Island (2020, €1.15B) for streetwear adjacency

**The model:** Seasonal luxury outerwear with scarcity dynamics (limited editions), experiential retail (pop-ups, Genius events), and DTC-heavy distribution.

## LVMH stake

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investment | 10% of Double R (Ruffini's vehicle) |
| Ruffini's Moncler stake | 15.8% (via Double R) |
| Effective LVMH stake | ~1.6% economic interest |
| Purpose | "Reinforce and give stability" — Ruffini |

Speculation of eventual [[LVMH]] acquisition, but Ruffini has denied. The stake cements a luxury ecosystem relationship.

## China exposure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China % of sales | **~35%** |
| China % of 2024 growth | **~60%** |
| Risk | Heavy concentration |

Moncler is among the most China-exposed luxury names. If China luxury doesn't recover, Moncler's growth stalls (as seen in H1 2025: +1% CC).

---

## Stone Island

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (2024) | €402M (-2%) |
| Acquisition price | €1.15B (2020) |
| Positioning | Technical sportswear, streetwear |
| [[Target]] | Younger demographic |

Stone Island has underperformed since acquisition — revenue declining while Moncler brand grows. Needs creative reinvigoration.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 30% EBIT margins in luxury outerwear
- €1.3B net cash, strong balance sheet
- Ruffini's proven brand-building track record
- Moncler Genius drives cultural relevance
- LVMH relationship = validation + potential exit

**Bear:**
- China ~35% exposure, 60% of growth
- H1 2025 slowdown (+1% CC)
- Stone Island underperforming
- Outerwear = seasonal concentration risk
- Premium valuation (~25x earnings)
