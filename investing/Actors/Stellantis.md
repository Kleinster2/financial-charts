CEO Carlos Tavares resigned December 2024. [[Exor]] (Agnelli) owns 14.2%. Stock down ~40% from 2024 highs.

## Financial performance

| Year | Revenue (€B) | Growth | Net Income (€B) | Margin | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 2021 | 152.1 | — | 13.4 | 8.8% | First year post-merger |
| 2022 | 179.6 | +18% | 16.8 | 9.4% | Strong execution |
| 2023 | 189.5 | +6% | 18.6 | 9.8% | Peak profitability |
| 2024 | 156.9 | **-17%** | ~5.5 | ~3.5% | Collapse |

**Pre-merger (FCA + PSA combined ~2019):** ~€180B combined revenue. Merger created 4th largest automaker.

**2024 collapse:** Revenue -17%, net income -70%. US inventory crisis (100+ days supply), [[EV transition]] delays, [[China]] exit, dealer/workforce friction. CEO Tavares resigned December 2024.

## Brand portfolio

| Region | Brands | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **North America** | Jeep, RAM, Dodge, Chrysler | Struggling — inventory glut |
| **[[Europe]]** | Peugeot, Citroën, Opel, Fiat | Stable but competitive |
| **Premium** | Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia | Subscale, restructuring |
| **Commercial** | RAM ProMaster, Fiat Professional | Solid |

**Jeep and RAM** are the profit engines — high-margin trucks/SUVs in North America. But 2024 saw massive inventory buildup requiring incentives.

## The Tavares exit

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 2024 | Profit warning — full-year guidance cut |
| Nov 2024 | CFO abrupt departure |
| Dec 2024 | **CEO Carlos Tavares resigns** |
| 2025 | Interim leadership, permanent CEO search |

**What went wrong:**
- US inventory crisis — 100+ days supply (normal is 60)
- [[EV transition]] slower than planned
- [[China]] retreat (JV dissolution)
- Cost-cutting alienated workforce and dealers
- Tavares' abrasive style created internal friction

## Ownership

| Shareholder | Stake |
|-------------|-------|
| [[Exor]] (Agnelli) | 14.2% |
| Peugeot family (EPF) | 7.2% |
| BPI [[France]] | 6.1% |
| Public | ~72% |

No controlling shareholder. Exor is largest but doesn't control.

## Regional performance (2024)

| Region | YoY Change | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| North America | -20%+ | Inventory crisis, incentive war |
| [[Europe]] | -10% | EV competition |
| [[China]] | Exiting | Dissolving JV |
| South America | Stable | Fiat strong |

## Feb 2026 strategic reset

**€22.2B ($26.5B) in one-time charges** announced Feb 6, 2026 — largest writedown in company history:

| Charge category | Amount (€B) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Product plan realignment | 14.7 |
| Warranty costs | 4.1 |
| EV supply chain resizing | 2.1 |
| European restructuring | 1.3 |
| **Total** | **22.2** |

CEO Filosa blamed prior management for overestimating EV transition pace. Pivoting toward range-extended EVs (EREVs) and traditional hybrids. Dividend cancelled for 2026. Issued €5B nonconvertible hybrid bond. CFO João Laranjo expects group profitability throughout 2026.

**Shares plunged 25% on Feb 6** — largest single-day drop on record. Market cap rout approaching **€70B** since early 2024.

### Battery manufacturing retreat

**[[ACC]] (Automotive Cells Company)** — JV with [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[TotalEnergies]] — definitively shelved gigafactory plans for **Kaiserslautern (Germany)** and **Termoli (Italy)** on Feb 7, 2026. Projects on standby since May 2024; prerequisites to restart not expected to be met. French plant (Douvrin) maintained but in partial unemployment talks.

**Canadian JV with [[LG Energy Solution]]** — sold 49% stake for **$100**, writing off $980M investment. Fewer battery factories needed as EV plans shrink.

**[[Samsung SDI]] StarPlus Energy JV** (Kokomo, Indiana) — 33 GWh Phase 1, status unclear given broader EV pullback.

Stellantis committed to e-DCT gearbox line at Termoli by end of 2026 and Euro 7 GSE engine investments to extend ICE production beyond 2030.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stock -40%, trading at ~3x depressed earnings
- Jeep/RAM franchise has value
- Cost structure can be cut further
- New CEO could reset strategy
- European brands (Peugeot) stable
- Dividend yield ~8% (if maintained)

**Bear:**
- No permanent CEO — leadership vacuum
- US franchise damaged (dealer relations, brand perception)
- [[EV transition]] behind competitors
- [[China]] exit = missing largest market
- UAW relations strained
- Tavares was the strategy — what now?
