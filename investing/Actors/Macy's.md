## "Bold New Chapter" strategy (Feb 2024)

Macy's turnaround plan:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Store closures | 150 over 3 years (66 confirmed, 14 more in Q1 2026) |
| Go-forward stores | 350 Macy's locations |
| "Reimagine" stores | 125 getting investment |
| Property sales | $275M (2024), targeting $150M (2025) |

**Early results:** Comparable sales +2.5% (Q3 2025) at go-forward stores. Reimagine stores showing sales uplift.

## Herald Square flagship

**The crown jewel** — 2.1M sq ft at 34th Street, Manhattan. "The World's Biggest Store."

### Valuation estimates

| Source | Flagship value | Total real estate |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| JPMorgan | $3B+ | $8.5B |
| Evercore ISI | $0.9-1.5B | $5-7B |
| Barington/Thor (Dec 2024) | $1.64-2.4B | $5-9B |
| TD Cowen | — | $7.5-11.6B |
| Starboard (2015) | $4B | — |

**The Richard Baker parallel:** Like [[Saks Global]], Macy's real estate may be worth more than the operating company. Activist investors argue the stock trades at a discount to property value.

**Barington Capital (Dec 2024):** "Macy's is sitting on real estate that is more valuable than the company itself." Pushed for real estate spinoff.

## Saks bankruptcy beneficiary

[[Saks bankruptcy]] (Jan 2026) is driving customer defections to Macy's:

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Customer migration | Saks/Neiman customers seeking alternatives |
| Vendor relationships | Brands need alternative distribution |
| Competitive position | One fewer luxury competitor |

Macy's positioned as "survivor" in [[Department store decline]].
