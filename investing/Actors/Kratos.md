**Kratos** — US defense disruptor. Affordable drones (Valkyrie), hypersonic targets. "Affordable at scale" philosophy challenges primes.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | KTOS |
| Market cap | ~$5B |
| Revenue | ~$1B |
| Employees | ~3,500 |

## Key products

| Product | Category | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| XQ-58 Valkyrie | Tactical drone | Attritable, AI-enabled |
| Firejet | [[Target]] drone | Hypersonic simulation |
| UTAP-22 | Manned-unmanned teaming | Loyal wingman |
| Hypersonic systems | Test targets | National defense testing |

## "Attritable" concept

Valkyrie = designed to be affordable enough to lose:

| Metric | Valkyrie | F-35 |
|--------|----------|------|
| Unit cost | ~$[[3M]] | ~$80M |
| Philosophy | Expendable | Must survive |
| Production | Rapid, scalable | Complex, limited |

**Complements, not replaces** manned fighters.

## Growth drivers

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Collaborative Combat Aircraft | USAF program for drone wingmen |
| Hypersonic testing | National priority |
| Ukraine lesson | Drone warfare validation |
| Attritable shift | DoD embracing concept |
| [[Australia]] | Ghost Bat program (similar) |

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Disruptive model (affordable drones)
- CCA program tailwind
- Hypersonic testing demand
- Ukraine validates drone warfare
- Lean cost structure

**Bear:**
- Still unprofitable at scale
- Primes entering market
- Program risk/delays
- Competition ([[Anduril]], others)
- Valuation stretched

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Comparison |
|------------|------------|
| [[Anduril]] | Private, broader focus |
| [[General Atomics]] | Established, larger |
| [[Boeing]] (MQ-25) | Prime entering |
| Northrop | Established drones |

Kratos = pure-play on affordable attritable drones.

## Financials

| Metric | Prior | Jan 2026 |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Stock price | — | **$114** (+50% YTD) |

Pricier than [[NVIDIA]] on forward earnings. Backlog surging on [[Golden Dome]] and drone warfare demand (William Blair's DiPalma: drone business "red hot").
