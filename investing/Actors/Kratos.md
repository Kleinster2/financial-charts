## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Disruptive model (affordable drones)
- CCA program tailwind
- Hypersonic testing demand
- Ukraine validates drone warfare
- Lean cost structure

**Bear:**
- Still unprofitable at scale
- Primes entering market
- Program risk/delays
- Competition ([[Anduril]], others)
- Valuation stretched

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Comparison |
|------------|------------|
| [[Anduril]] | Private, broader focus |
| General Atomics | Established, larger |
| Boeing (MQ-25) | Prime entering |
| Northrop | Established drones |

Kratos = pure-play on affordable attritable drones.
