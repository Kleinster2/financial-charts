**Kratos Defense & Security Solutions** (NASDAQ: KTOS) — San Diego-based defense technology company specializing in affordable unmanned systems, hypersonic test vehicles, space/satellite communications, microwave electronics, and rocket/missile defense systems. Founded 1994 as a telecom firm, pivoted to defense under CEO [[Eric DeMarco]] (since 2004). Core philosophy: "affordability is a technology" — building at-cost points that let the [[DoD]] buy in volume rather than exquisite small batches.

### XQ-58A Valkyrie — flagship program
- First flight: March 5, 2019 at [[Yuma Proving Ground]]
- Designed under USAF Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program
- Stealth UCAV — trapezoidal fuselage, internal weapons bay, rocket-assisted launch (no runway needed)
- USAF determined airframe too small for its [[Collaborative Combat Aircraft]] (CCA) program, but Marine Corps selected it
- **USMC MUX TACAIR CCA** (Jan 2026): [[Northrop Grumman]] as prime, Kratos provides XQ-58 airframe. Northrop integrates mission systems.
- **$34.8M USMC contract** (Jul 2025) for Valkyrie mission system integration
- **[[Airbus]] partnership** (Jul 2025): developing UCCA variant for [[Germany]] Air Force based on XQ-58A, combat-ready target 2029
- **Delivery target**: 15–20 Valkyrie aircraft in 2026

### "Attritable" concept

| Metric | Valkyrie | F-35 |
|--------|----------|------|
| Unit cost | ~$3M | ~$80M |
| Philosophy | Expendable, mass-produced | Must survive |
| Production | Rapid, scalable | Complex, limited |
| Runway | None (rocket launch) | Required |

**Complements, not replaces** manned fighters — extends sensor/weapons reach at fraction of cost.

- **CapEx**: $28M in Q3 2025 alone — investing heavily in production capacity
- **FCF**: Negative in Q3 ($41.3M used) due to working capital from rapid growth + capex

### Valuation (Feb 2026)

| Multiple | Value |
|----------|-------|
| P/S (TTM) | ~12x |
| P/S (FY2026E) | ~10x |
| EV/EBITDA (FY2025E) | ~130x |

## Major contracts & catalysts

| Date | Contract/Event | Value | Significance |
|------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Jan 2026 | USMC MUX TACAIR CCA (with [[Northrop Grumman]]) | TBD (large) | Valkyrie selected as Marine Corps loyal wingman platform |
| Jul 2025 | USMC Valkyrie mission system integration | $34.8M | Production contract modification |
| Jul 2025 | [[Airbus]] UCCA partnership (Germany) | TBD | International expansion, combat-ready by 2029 |
| Q2 2025 | Poseidon program downselect | ~$750M potential | Major classified program win |
| Q2 2025 | DMOS downselect | TBD | Another major program win |
| **Feb 18, 2026** | **JHTO thermal protection systems** | **TBD** | **Hypersonic materials testing for Joint Hypersonics Transition Office** |

---

## Growth drivers

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| [[Collaborative Combat Aircraft]] | USAF/USMC programs for drone wingmen — Valkyrie is leading platform |
| Hypersonic testing | National priority, sole-source for many test targets |
| [[Golden Dome]] | Missile defense architecture driving rocket systems backlog |
| Ukraine/drone warfare validation | Proved attritable drones change warfare economics |
| International expansion | [[Airbus]]/Germany, [[Australia]] Ghost Bat-adjacent, NATO allies |
| Iran strike scenario | Hypersonic missiles key for deep underground nuclear facilities — [[Polymarket]] 67% odds (Feb 2026) |
| Defense budget expansion | $1.5T+ US defense budget, NATO 2%+ commitments |
| Serial production ramp | Moving from development to volume manufacturing in 2026 |

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Comparison |
|------------|------------|
| [[General Atomics]] | Won USAF OBSS over Kratos (XQ-67A), but Kratos won USMC. GA = larger, established, Reaper/MQ-9 heritage |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | Partner on USMC CCA (prime contractor), competitor on USAF CCA (won Increment 1) |
| [[Anduril]] | Private, broader portfolio (Fury drone, Lattice OS), different market segment |
| [[Boeing]] (MQ-25) | Prime entering autonomous — MQ-25 Stingray for carrier refueling |
| [[L3Harris]] | Competes in space/satellite comms, microwave electronics |
| [[AeroVironment]] | Peer in drones but focused on loitering munitions (Switchblade), not loyal wingmen |
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | Skunk Works CCA competitor, primes generally building larger/more expensive systems |

**Kratos's moat**: years ahead on affordable jet-powered drone production at scale. Primes are entering but building expensive systems. Kratos's XQ-58 flies today; competitors' CCA programs are still in development. The "affordable at scale" DNA is organizational, not just technical.

## Stock performance

- **Best-performing defense stock** of 2025 per Motley Fool
- 52-week range: $23.90–$134.00 (460%+ swing)
- Up ~280% from 52-week low
- Dropped ~12% in late Jan 2026 on valuation concerns (stock had run from ~$24 to $134)
- Feb 18, 2026: up 3.3% on JHTO contract + Iran strike probability increase

---

## Investment thesis

### Bull case
- **Disruptive positioning**: only public pure-play on affordable tactical drones at scale
- **Revenue acceleration**: 11-13% → 15-20% → 18-23% organic growth over three years
- **Margin expansion**: 100bp/year EBITDA improvement as production scales
- **$13B pipeline**: record bid pipeline suggests multi-year revenue visibility
- **Multiple program wins**: Poseidon ($750M), USMC CCA, DMOS, international — not single-program dependent
- **Geopolitical tailwind**: Iran strike scenario, NATO rearmament, Ukraine lessons all drive drone/hypersonic demand
- **Debt-free**: paid off $180M term loan, clean balance sheet for growth investment
- **Serial production inflection**: 2026 is the year Valkyrie moves from development to volume delivery

### Bear case
- **Valuation**: ~12x sales, ~130x EBITDA, ~106x FY2027E earnings — priced for perfection
- **Profitability**: barely GAAP profitable, negative FCF as capex ramps
- **Primes entering**: [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Boeing]] all developing CCA programs
- **Program risk**: USAF chose [[General Atomics]] XQ-67 over Valkyrie for OBSS — not guaranteed wins
- **Fixed-price contract pain**: Q3 2025 margins hurt by 2020-21 era fixed-price contracts that can't be renegotiated
- **Customer concentration**: heavily dependent on US DoD
- **Execution risk**: scaling from development shop to volume manufacturer is operationally challenging

## Iran strike angle (Feb 2026)

[[Polymarket]] pricing Iran strike at 67% probability. Kratos is a direct beneficiary:
- **Hypersonic missiles** are the primary weapon for penetrating deeply buried, hardened nuclear facilities (Fordow is under a mountain)
- Kratos builds hypersonic test vehicles and thermal protection systems — today's JHTO contract directly supports this capability
- Defense rocket systems segment grew 47% in Q3 — missile defense and strike systems are surging
- Stock up 5-9% on Iran probability increases — market recognizes the connection

---

## Recent developments (Feb 2026)

- **Feb 18, 2026**: Awarded JHTO contract for thermal protection systems testing for hypersonic vehicles — standardized test methodologies and material test campaigns
- **Feb 17, 2026**: Satellite ground systems contract (details limited)
- **Jan 2026**: [[Northrop Grumman]]/Kratos team selected for USMC MUX TACAIR CCA
- **Nomad acquisition**: recently completed, earning out via $7M holdback + $10M milestone equity
