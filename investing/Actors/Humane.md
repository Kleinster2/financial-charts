# Humane

Failed AI hardware startup. The AI Pin ($699) became a cautionary tale for the screenless AI category. Shut down Feb 2025, assets sold to HP for $116M.

## Why it matters

**Case study in what NOT to do** for AI hardware:
- Overpromised, underdelivered
- Tried to replace phone instead of augment it
- Premium price ($699) for buggy product
- Returns exceeded sales at one point

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2018 | Founded by ex-Apple employees Imran Chaudhri & Bethany Bongiorno |
| 2023 | $240M total funding, massive hype |
| Apr 2024 | AI Pin launches at $699 + $24/mo subscription |
| Mid 2024 | Returns start outpacing sales |
| Summer 2024 | Battery fire concerns — told customers to stop using charging case |
| Nov 2024 | Refund cutoff date for later buyers |
| Feb 18, 2025 | HP acquires assets for $116M |
| Feb 28, 2025 | All AI Pin services shut down |

## What went wrong

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Buggy software** | Poor reviews at launch, unreliable AI responses |
| **Battery issues** | Fire risk with charging case |
| **Wrong thesis** | Tried to replace phone, not augment it |
| **Premium pricing** | $699 + $24/mo for unproven category |
| **No killer app** | Nothing it did better than phone |
| **Sales miss** | Targeted 100K units, sold ~10K |

**The reviews:** Near-universal pans from tech reviewers. Became a meme for AI hardware hubris.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total raised | $240M |
| Sale price | $116M (to HP) |
| Units sold | ~10,000 (vs 100K target) |
| Price | $699 + $24/mo |
| Investor loss | ~$124M+ (excluding operational burn) |

## HP acquisition

HP bought:
- AI platform "Cosmos"
- 300+ patents and applications
- Key talent (founders joined HP)

HP formed **HP IQ** — new AI innovation lab using Humane assets. The tech lives on, the product doesn't.

## Lessons for the category

**What survivors learned:**
1. **Don't replace the phone** — Bee, Friend augment instead
2. **Price matters** — Bee is $50, not $699
3. **Do one thing well** — journaling, transcription, not everything
4. **Ship working product** — hype can't overcome bugs
5. **Battery life** — week-long (Bee) beats hours (AI Pin)

**Who applied the lessons:**
- [[Amazon]] (Bee) — cheap, focused, ambient
- [[OpenAI]] + Jony Ive — explicitly NOT wearable, learning from failures

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Screenless AI]] | Cautionary tale — premium + buggy = death |
| [[Consumer AI]] | Hardware is hard; software-first may win |
