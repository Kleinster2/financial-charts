## Competitive position

| Company | Share | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | Pure-play |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Diversified |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | Diversified |
| **Sumitomo Chemical** | ~8% | Growing |
| [[DuPont]] / [[Qnity]] | ~7% | US |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | [[Europe]] |

**Top 7 = 86% of market** (2023).

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Aggressive capacity expansion positions for EUV growth
- Proprietary organic molecular resist technology (next-gen)
- Korea presence for Samsung/Hynix supply chain
- Diversified revenue base (less cyclical)
- ¥100B profit target provides clear catalyst

**Bear:**
- [[Photoresists]] are small part of overall business
- Conglomerate discount
- Petrochemicals exposure (commodity volatility)
- Behind JSR/TOK in market share
- Pharmaceutical subsidiary headwinds

---

## Why not pure-play

Unlike [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]], Sumitomo Chemical is a diversified conglomerate. [[Photoresists]] drive <20% of revenue. Investors get semiconductor materials exposure diluted by petrochemicals and pharma.

**Better for:** Investors wanting diversified [[Japan]] chemicals exposure with semiconductor optionality.
