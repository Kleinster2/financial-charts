**SK Hynix** — Korean memory manufacturer, leader in HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for AI.

## Core thesis

SK Hynix dominates HBM but depends on [[TSMC]] for [[Advanced packaging|packaging]]. Now pushing to vertically integrate into 2.5D packaging to offer turn-key solutions and reduce TSMC dependency.

![[skhynix-vs-peers.png]]
*SK Hynix +700% since 2018 — underperformed [[Semiconductors|SMH]] (+550%) during 2022-2023 memory downturn, but HBM leadership driving 2024-2025 outperformance.*

*vs [[Semiconductors|SMH]]*

## Key strengths

- **HBM leadership**: Supplies NVIDIA, AMD with HBM for AI accelerators
- **Memory expertise**: DRAM/NAND capabilities
- **U.S. expansion**: Indiana packaging plant (2028), **$15B total US commitment**
- **Tariff risk**: [[Howard Lutnick]] threatens 100% tariffs unless building in US (Jan 2026)
- **Pricing power**: China fab constraints ([[Export controls]]) support memory margins

---

## Capacity expansion (Jan 2026)

**Major expansion announced:**
- Investment: **4x previous levels** announced
- Equipment spending: $29.66B industry total (+27.2%) — Korea back to #2 globally
- Server DRAM pricing: Seeking **+70% price hikes**

**M15X fab (Cheongju, Korea):**
- First cleanroom opened Oct 2025 — **2 months ahead of schedule**
- **Now starting 4 months early** — Feb 2026 vs June original (dedicated to HBM4 for NVIDIA Rubin)
- Producing HBM3E/4 DRAM (1b process)
- Adding 1c DRAM lines (6th gen)
- Second cleanroom in hook-up design (final stage)
- Production scaling: 35K → 55K-60K wafers/month

**M8 P&T6 packaging fab (Cheongju):**
- Few months from operation
- Converted from old image sensor fab
- Will do TSV and vertical stacking for HBM
- Advanced packaging capacity onshore (Korea)

**Stargate commitment:** 900K DRAM wafers/month committed for [[Project Stargate|OpenAI Stargate]].

## Strategic move: 2.5D packaging (US)

- Building first 2.5D mass production line in West Lafayette, Indiana
- Target: 2028 operation
- Investment: $3.87B
- Goal: Turn-key model (HBM + packaging) to bypass TSMC's CoWoS monopoly

## Financials

![[skhynix-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue and net income show classic memory cyclicality — 2018 supercycle, 2023 downturn (-$7.8B loss), 2024-2025 HBM-driven recovery.*

## Why it matters for foundry wars

SK Hynix isn't a foundry, but:
- They're attacking a [[TSMC]] moat (packaging)
- Combined with [[Samsung]]'s foundry push, Korea is challenging Taiwan on two fronts
- "Korea's two semiconductor giants are basically trolling Taiwan"

---

## Key relationships

| Partner/Competitor | Relationship |
|--------------------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Current packaging dependency, future competitor |
| NVIDIA | Key HBM customer |
| [[Samsung]] | Korean rival in memory, ally in challenging Taiwan |

## CES 2026 showcase

**SK Hynix showcased next-gen AI memory:**

| Product | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **16-layer HBM4** | Launches **February 2026** |
| SOCAMM2 | Next-gen server memory module |
| LPDDR6 | Mobile memory standard |

**HBM4 fully sold out:** CFO confirmed entire 2026 HBM supply already contracted.

**Yongin cluster:** Expected to become world's largest HBM production hub by 2027.

**Supercycle context (Jan 2026):** Bank of America calls this a "supercycle similar to 1990s boom" — DRAM revenue +51% YoY, NAND +45%. Nov 2025 monthly semiconductor sales hit $75.3B (all-time record, +29.8% YoY). IDC warns "unprecedented" shortage may persist to 2027.

## New York listing exploration (Jan 2026)

**Potential US listing:**
- Exploring New York listing
- Goal: Narrow valuation gap with [[Micron]]
- Would increase global investor access
- Part of broader Asia IPO wave (see [[Asia IPO pipeline 2026]])

## HBM market position (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total HBM market share** | **50%+** | Goldman Sachs |
| HBM3/HBM3E dominance | Through at least 2026 | Goldman Sachs |
| 2026 HBM market size | **$54.6B** (+58% YoY) | Bank of America |
| Custom ASIC HBM demand | +82% YoY (⅓ of market) | Goldman Sachs |

**Analyst view:** Goldman Sachs assesses SK Hynix "will maintain its dominant position in HBM3 and HBM3E until at least 2026."

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HBM position | #1 globally (**50%+ share**) |
| HBM4 status | **Paid samples delivered to NVIDIA** (Dec 2025) |
| HBM3E pricing | **+20% for 2026** |
| Q4 2025 gross margin | **63-67%** (exceeding TSMC, first since Q4 2018) |
| Indiana investment | $3.87B |
| 2.5D mass production | Targeting 2028 |
| US listing | Exploring (2026) |

## Market expectations

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| HBM dominance | Continued | |
| 2.5D packaging | Unproven | |
| TSMC dependency | Remains near-term | |

**Priced in:**
- HBM leadership continues
- AI memory demand growth

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Successful 2.5D packaging ramp
- Turn-key wins (HBM + packaging)
- TSMC packaging capacity crunch benefits SK Hynix

---

## For theses

- [[Long memory]] — HBM leader, purest play on memory shortage
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — packaging bet funds challenge to TSMC moat
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — more memory chips = more test demand
