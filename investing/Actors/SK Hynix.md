**SK Hynix** — Korean memory manufacturer, leader in HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for AI.

## Core thesis

SK Hynix dominates HBM but depends on [[TSMC]] for [[Advanced packaging|packaging]]. Now pushing to vertically integrate into 2.5D packaging to offer turn-key solutions and reduce TSMC dependency.

---

## Key strengths

- **HBM leadership**: Supplies NVIDIA, AMD with HBM for AI accelerators
- **Memory expertise**: DRAM/NAND capabilities
- **U.S. expansion**: Indiana packaging plant (2028)
- **Pricing power**: China fab constraints ([[Export controls]]) support memory margins

---

## Capacity expansion (Dec 2025)

**M15X fab (Cheongju, Korea):**
- First cleanroom opened Oct 2025 — **2 months ahead of schedule**
- **Now starting 4 months early** — Feb 2026 vs June original (dedicated to HBM4 for NVIDIA Rubin)
- Producing HBM3E/4 DRAM (1b process)
- Adding 1c DRAM lines (6th gen)
- Second cleanroom in hook-up design (final stage)
- Production scaling: 35K → 55K-60K wafers/month

**M8 P&T6 packaging fab (Cheongju):**
- Few months from operation
- Converted from old image sensor fab
- Will do TSV and vertical stacking for HBM
- Advanced packaging capacity onshore (Korea)

---

## Strategic move: 2.5D packaging (US)

- Building first 2.5D mass production line in West Lafayette, Indiana
- Target: 2028 operation
- Investment: $3.87B
- Goal: Turn-key model (HBM + packaging) to bypass TSMC's CoWoS monopoly

---

## Why it matters for foundry wars

SK Hynix isn't a foundry, but:
- They're attacking a [[TSMC]] moat (packaging)
- Combined with [[Samsung]]'s foundry push, Korea is challenging Taiwan on two fronts
- "Korea's two semiconductor giants are basically trolling Taiwan"

## Key relationships

| Partner/Competitor | Relationship |
|--------------------|--------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Current packaging dependency, future competitor |
| NVIDIA | Key HBM customer |
| [[Samsung]] | Korean rival in memory, ally in challenging Taiwan |

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HBM position | #1 globally |
| HBM4 status | **Paid samples delivered to NVIDIA** (Dec 2025) |
| HBM3E pricing | **+20% for 2026** |
| Q4 2025 gross margin | **63-67%** (exceeding TSMC, first since Q4 2018) |
| Indiana investment | $3.87B |
| 2.5D mass production | Targeting 2028 |

## Market expectations

| Expectation | Consensus | Source/Date |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| HBM dominance | Continued | |
| 2.5D packaging | Unproven | |
| TSMC dependency | Remains near-term | |

**Priced in:**
- HBM leadership continues
- AI memory demand growth

**Not priced in (potential surprises):**
- Successful 2.5D packaging ramp
- Turn-key wins (HBM + packaging)
- TSMC packaging capacity crunch benefits SK Hynix

---

## For theses

- [[Long memory]] — HBM leader, purest play on memory shortage
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — packaging bet funds challenge to TSMC moat
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — more memory chips = more test demand
