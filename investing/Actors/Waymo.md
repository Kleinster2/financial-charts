## Competitive position

| Competitor | Status | Waymo advantage |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| [[Cruise]] | Resumed limited ops (2024) | Larger fleet, more cities, no fatal incidents |
| [[Tesla]] FSD | Austin robotaxi (w/ safety observer); Level 2 only | Level 4 fully driverless; no supervision required |
| [[Zoox]] ([[Amazon]]) | Limited SF deployment | 5 cities operational, 20+ pipeline |
| [[Aurora]] | Trucking focus | Consumer robotaxi focus |
| [[Baidu]] Apollo | China only | US/international markets |

Waymo = clear leader in commercial robotaxi globally.

**Tesla comparison:** Tesla's camera-only approach (no Lidar) faces safety questions. Lost $243M Florida lawsuit over fatal Autopilot accident. Austin robotaxi still requires safety observer or trailing vehicle. Cybercab (dedicated robotaxi) announced but not yet in production.

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Unit economics | $350M revenue vs $5B+ annual burn (est.) |
| Scaling costs | Lidar hardware, HD mapping each city |
| Regulation | City-by-city approval; California more permissive than some states |
| Weather | Denver expansion tests cold weather capability |
| Competition | Tesla aims for unsupervised FSD; China players advancing |

## Investment implications

**Part of Alphabet (GOOGL):**

At $126B valuation vs Alphabet's ~$2T market cap, Waymo represents ~6.3% of Alphabet's value. Alphabet contributed >75% of the $16B Series D round.

**Valuation context:** $126B is only 1/6th of [[OpenAI]]'s ~$750B and less than half of [[Anthropic]]'s ~$300B — despite Waymo having commercial robotaxi operations at scale (450K weekly rides).

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| "Other Bets" segment | Revenue not broken out separately |
| External investors | a16z, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price have stakes |
| Spin-off potential | Possible if hits profitability |
| Tesla risk | FSD success could commoditize robotaxi |

Waymo is the most valuable asset in Other Bets, but still a small slice of Alphabet.
