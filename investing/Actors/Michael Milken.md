## The junk bond revolution

**The insight:** Sub-investment-grade bonds ("junk") had historically been only "fallen angels." Milken proved they could be originated intentionally for growing companies, and that a diversified portfolio of junk bonds offered returns far exceeding their default-adjusted risk.

**What he built at Drexel:**
- Operated from Beverly Hills (not New York) — deliberately separate from Wall Street establishment
- Created both supply (issuing junk for companies) and demand (selling to institutional buyers)
- ~50% market share in junk bond underwriting
- $150B junk bond market by end of 1980s
- "Highly confident letters" — enabling hostile takeovers without committed financing

**The LBO connection:** Junk bonds provided the leverage for buyouts. Without Milken, no RJR Nabisco, no hostile takeover era, no modern PE industry. He was the enabler — providing capital to raiders like Icahn, Pickens, and Turner.

## Conviction and fall

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1986 | Ivan Boesky convicted, cooperates against Milken |
| 1989 | Indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud |
| 1990 | Plea: guilty to 6 securities violations (not racketeering, not insider trading) |
| 1990 | Sentenced: 10 years, $600M fine, lifetime securities ban |
| 1991 | Began serving sentence |
| 1993 | Released (sentence reduced to time served) |
| 1998 | SEC settled: $47M fine for alleged violations of industry bar |
| 2020 | Full presidential pardon (Trump) |

**Key context:** Milken pleaded to securities and reporting violations — not the racketeering or insider trading charges. The $600M fine was the largest individual penalty in securities law history.

## Intellectual legacy

Milken's core insight — that credit risk can be systematically priced and traded — is the foundation of:
- The high-yield bond market ($1.5T+ today)
- [[Private credit]] as an asset class
- The leveraged loan market
- CLOs and structured credit
- [[Apollo]]'s entire business model (credit-first, insurance-funded)

[[Marc Rowan]], who worked under Milken at Drexel, took the insight further: if you can price credit risk, you can also *manufacture* the liabilities that fund it (via [[Athene]]'s annuities).
