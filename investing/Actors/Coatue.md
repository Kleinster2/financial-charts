## Strategy

Lifecycle technology investing — Coatue invests across the full spectrum from seed-stage to mega-cap public equities.

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Hedge fund | Long/short equity, fundamental, top-down. US + non-US tech, media, telecom. Swaps, options, ETFs for hedging |
| Venture | Early-stage startups, leveraging public market insights |
| Growth | Late-stage private. Identifying next-gen platform companies |
| Tactical | Structured debt + equity capital solutions |
| CTEK | Closed-end fund for qualified individuals (launched May 2025) |

Crossover edge: Public market research infrastructure (tracking hundreds of public tech companies) informs private investment decisions and vice versa.

Mosaic platform: Proprietary data science system aggregating alternative data — satellite imagery, web traffic, credit card data, social media signals. Built on Domino Data Lab. Coatue was among the first hedge funds to systematically use alternative data in tech investing.

Risk management: Actively manages gross/net exposure. During 2022 downturn, reduced gross exposure to 23% and net to 14%.

Portfolio concentration: Top 10 holdings = 47% of portfolio. Information technology = 53%. Turnover rate: 15%.

## 2022 stress test

Coatue's 2022 losses were significant but less severe than peers. [[Tiger Global]] was down 50%+. Coatue released a 42-slide investor presentation (May 2022) acknowledging losses and outlining defensive positioning. Cited three conviction stocks: [[Tesla]], [[NVIDIA]], [[Datadog]]. The [[NVIDIA]] call proved prescient as AI demand exploded in 2023. By mid-2024, Coatue had recovered above its high-water mark.
