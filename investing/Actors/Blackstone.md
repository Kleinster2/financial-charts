**Blackstone** — World's largest alternative asset manager. Major data center investor via QTS.

---

## Why Blackstone matters

Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager — and increasingly an AI infrastructure play:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $1T+ |
| Data center platform | QTS (acquired 2021) |
| QTS acquisition price | $10B |
| CoreWeave financing | Part of $7.5B debt |

---

## QTS Data Centers

**Acquired 2021 for $10B** — now cornerstone of Blackstone's digital infra strategy:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Footprint | 35+ data centers |
| Capacity | 2+ GW |
| Customers | Hyperscalers, enterprise |
| Strategy | Build-to-suit for AI |

**Post-acquisition:**
- Significant expansion
- AI-focused capacity additions
- Benefits from hyperscaler demand

---

## AI infrastructure exposure

**Direct:**
- QTS data centers
- CoreWeave debt financing ($7.5B consortium)
- Various DC investments globally

**Why data centers:**
- Stable, long-term cash flows
- Hyperscaler credit quality
- Tangible assets
- Secular AI demand tailwind

## Competitive position vs Blue Owl

| Aspect | Blackstone | [[Blue Owl]] |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| AUM | $1T+ | $273B |
| DC approach | Own/operate (QTS) | Finance (JVs) |
| Largest AI deal | QTS $10B | Meta $27B |
| Public stock | BX | OWL |

Blackstone owns and operates; Blue Owl finances and co-invests.

## CoreWeave financing

Blackstone participated in CoreWeave's $7.5B+ debt financing:
- GPU-backed lending
- Part of broader AI infrastructure credit strategy
- Higher risk than traditional real estate

---

## Private credit / cov-lite lending (Jan 2026)

**Participating in covenant-lite deals:**

| Deal | Sponsor | Co-lenders |
|------|---------|------------|
| **JTC Plc** | [[Permira]] + CPPIB | CVC Credit, [[GIC]] |

**Context:** [[Private credit]] market seeing cov-lite creep as top PE sponsors extract looser terms. Blackstone competing for deal flow alongside traditional covenant-protected lending.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Largest alternative manager = deal flow
- QTS positioned for AI demand
- Diversified beyond just data centers
- Management fee stability
- Public stock (BX)

**Bear:**
- Interest rate sensitivity
- Data center oversupply risk
- AI capex cycle could turn
- QTS valuation embedded in BX stock
- Regulatory risk (see Trump housing ban below)

---

## Single-family rental exposure

**Invitation Homes spin-off:**
- Blackstone built Invitation Homes (largest US single-family landlord)
- IPO'd 2017, Blackstone exited
- Still owns ~230,000 apartment units (largest PE apartment owner)
- Single-family = ~2% of real estate AUM, ~0.5% of total firm

**Jan 7, 2026 — Trump announcement:**

Trump announced plans to ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes:
- "People live in homes, not corporations"
- Details expected at Davos
- BX stock fell 6% (down 9.3% intraday)
- Invitation Homes -7%, Apollo and BlackRock also hit

**Blackstone response:** "We have been a net seller of homes over the last decade — holdings down more than one-fifth."
