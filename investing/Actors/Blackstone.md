## Why Blackstone matters

Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager — and increasingly an AI infrastructure play:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $1T+ |
| Data center platform | QTS (acquired 2021) |
| QTS acquisition price | $10B |
| CoreWeave financing | Part of $7.5B debt |

## QTS Data Centers

**Acquired 2021 for $10B** — now cornerstone of Blackstone's digital infra strategy:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Footprint | 35+ data centers |
| Capacity | 2+ GW |
| Customers | Hyperscalers, enterprise |
| Strategy | Build-to-suit for AI |

**Post-acquisition:**
- Significant expansion
- AI-focused capacity additions
- Benefits from hyperscaler demand

## AI infrastructure exposure

**Direct:**
