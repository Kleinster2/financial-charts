## Investment approach

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Permanent capital | No fund lifecycle, no forced exits |
| Entrepreneurial | Partnership model, not financial engineering |
| Operational | Focus on development, not leverage |
| Geographic | France and Italy primarily |
| Sectors | Business services, consumer, healthcare, industry |

**Differentiator:** Patient capital. Portfolio companies develop at their own pace — contrasts with typical 5-7 year PE fund cycles.
