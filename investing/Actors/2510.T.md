| Yield | 0.85% |

## Composition

JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds), municipal bonds, and investment-grade corporate bonds across all maturities. The NOMURA-BPI Overall index is Japan's equivalent of the Bloomberg US Aggregate — the standard domestic bond benchmark.

## Use Case

Japanese rates proxy. The low yield (~0.85%) reflects [[Bank of Japan]] rate normalization still in early stages. In the global bonds dashboard chart, 2510.T represents the Japanese leg of the sovereign curve alongside [[TLT]], [[IGLT.L]], [[IBGL.L]], [[XLB.TO]], [[GOVT.AX]], and [[CBON]].
