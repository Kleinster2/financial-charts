**National Ignition Facility** — US government laser fusion research facility at [[LLNL]] in Livermore, California. Achieved first-ever controlled fusion ignition in December 2022, producing more energy from the fusion target than the laser energy delivered to it. Uses 192 laser beams to compress deuterium-tritium fuel targets via inertial confinement fusion (ICF). Technology basis for [[Inertia Enterprises]].
