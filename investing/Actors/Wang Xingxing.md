## Origin story: the engineering obsession

Wang Xingxing (王兴兴, b. 1990, Yuyao/Ningbo, [[Zhejiang]]) is an unusual founder — not a business school grad or serial entrepreneur, but a compulsive tinkerer who nearly failed out of school because of terrible English scores. Teachers called him "a bit dumb." He built model airplanes as a child, micro-turbine jet engines in middle school, and a bipedal robot for ¥200 (~$30) in his freshman year at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University. He couldn't get into ZJU (his dream school), did his master's at [[Shanghai University]], and built XDog — a quadruped prototype — for ¥20,000 (~$3,000) as his thesis project in 2015. XDog won second place in a robotics competition (¥80,000 prize — his "first pot of gold").

After graduating in 2016, he joined [[DJI]] but quit within two months when XDog went viral and an angel investor offered ¥2M (~$275K). He was 26. The company nearly couldn't make payroll for the first three years.

## Philosophy and quotes

- "Most innovations in society are amalgams. You can combine the latest ideas from various industries to be cutting-edge — and actually be the best in the world."
- Calls [[Boston Dynamics]]' [[Marc Raibert]] his idol — but differentiates on cost: "When I was making XDog in 2013–2015, they hadn't even figured out electric actuators."
- "Our goal is to keep prices competitive while maintaining reasonable profit margins."
- "We optimized everything from mechanical structure to control algorithms, and kept key hardware and supply chain under our control."
- Personally interviews new hires, works alongside engineers, serves as both CEO and effectively CTO. ~500 employees by early 2025.

## Leadership style

Wang's DNA is engineer-founder, not MBA-founder. The company reflects this: relentless cost optimization, vertical integration, fast iteration, and a "good enough at 1/10th the price" philosophy that mirrors [[DJI]]'s disruption of the drone market. He holds 34.76% of [[Unitree]] as controlling shareholder.

## Recognition

- TIME100 AI (2025).
- Front row at [[Xi Jinping]]'s business symposium (Jan 2025), youngest entrepreneur there, seated near [[Ren Zhengfei]].
- Met Xi weeks after [[Unitree]]'s 2025 Spring Festival Gala performance.
