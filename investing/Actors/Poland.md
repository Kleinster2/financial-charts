## Defense spending

Poland has driven defense spending to **4-5% of GDP** — among the highest in [[NATO]], extraordinary for its economy's size.

| Defense spending | 4-5% of GDP |
| NATO context | Highest % in Europe |

**Hedging against German unreliability:** [[Adam Tooze]] (Feb 2026) frames Poland's defense surge as hedging not just against [[Russia]] but against the possibility that [[Germany]] won't show up as a reliable security partner. Poland would not be spending at this level if it had a trusting relationship with Berlin.
