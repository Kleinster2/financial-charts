# Altice

Debt-laden telecom empire controlled by [[Patrick Drahi]], spanning the US (Optimum), France (SFR), Portugal, Israel, and the Caribbean. Once valued at over $60B, now fighting creditors for survival as the leverage that built the empire unwinds.

## Structure

**Altice USA** (NYSE: OPTU, formerly ATUS) — rebranded to Optimum Communications in late 2025. Fifth-largest US cable operator serving ~4.9M customers through Optimum (Northeast) and Suddenlink (South/Midwest). Built through Cablevision acquisition from the Dolan family in 2015.

**Altice France** — owns SFR, France's second-largest telecom. Completed €8.6B debt restructuring in Feb 2025, giving [[BlackRock]], Fidelity, and PIMCO a 45% stake while Drahi retained 55% control.

**Altice International** — holds Altice Portugal, Altice Caribbean, and HOT (Israel). In Dec 2025, Drahi removed Portugal and Caribbean from creditor collateral pools, stranding €8B+ in secured debt.

## The Debt Crisis

The Altice empire was built through aggressive leveraged acquisitions. At peak, consolidated debt exceeded $60B across entities. As interest rates rose and cable subscribers fled, the structure became unsustainable.

Drahi's response has been a series of aggressive creditor maneuvers:
- **2024**: Altice USA used newly designated "unrestricted subsidiaries" to refinance debt outside existing credit agreements
- **Feb 2025**: Altice France restructuring wiped €8.6B debt, gave creditors equity
- **Dec 2025**: Altice International moved Portugal/Caribbean out of collateral, triggering bond price collapse
- **Sep 2025**: Hired [[Kirkland & Ellis]] + Evercore to advise on restructuring
- **Nov 2025**: Altice USA (now Optimum) sued [[Apollo]], [[Ares Management]], and [[BlackRock]] alleging an "illegal cartel" among lenders holding majority of its $26B debt
- **Post-lawsuit**: Kirkland withdrew — all three defendants are major Kirkland clients

## Patrick Drahi

French-Israeli-Portuguese billionaire (b. 1963 Morocco). Built Altice from 2001 Amsterdam founding through aggressive M&A funded with high-yield debt. Also owns [[Sotheby's]] (acquired 2019) and 24.5% of BT Group.

Drahi's longtime business partner Armando Pereira was detained in Portugal (July 2023) over corruption and tax fraud allegations at Altice Portugal.
