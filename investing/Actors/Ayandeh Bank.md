## Formation — designed for extraction

### The merger (2012-2015)

| **Tat Bank** | Private bank | Founded 2009 by [[Ali Ansari]] with Ahmadinejad support |
| **Salehin Credit Institution** | State-linked | Merged in |
| **Aatee Credit Institution** | State-linked | Merged in |

**Timeline:**

- 2012: Merger announced
- 2013: Formally registered as Ayandeh Bank
- 2015: Begins operations

### [[Ali Ansari]] — the founder

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Born | December 1962, Tehran |
| Background | Construction family, rejected residential building |
| First venture | Pipe/profile factory in Karaj (1993) |
| Key business | Bazar Ahan Shadabad — Iran's largest metals trading hub (1994) |
| Ownership | ~65% of Ayandeh via family and affiliates |

**Business empire funded by Ayandeh:**
- Iran Mall (megaproject)
- Mashhad Mall
- Rotana Hotel
- Farmaniyeh Mall
- Iron, furniture, mobile phone markets

**Political protection:**
- Primary intermediary for [[Mojtaba Khamenei]]'s offshore empire (Supreme Leader's son)
- Charged with embezzlement in 2022 — escaped prosecution
- Connections shielded him from scrutiny for years
- Also controls £100M+ UK property, European hotels for Khamenei network

**Who knew and when:**

| Official | Position | Knowledge |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Ebrahim Raisi | President (d. 2024) | Received "Top Secret — Very Urgent" letter Nov 2023 |
| Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf | Parliament Speaker | Briefed since Dec 2022 |
| Mohsen Rezaei | Sec., Supreme Economic Coordination Council | Sent letters to leadership Nov 2023 |
| Mohammad-Reza Farzin | Central Bank Governor | Announced dissolution |

**Under Raisi (2022-2024):** CBI injected *another* 2,000 trillion rials (~$1.9B) into Ayandeh despite documented awareness of its insolvency.

**[[UK]] sanctions (Oct 2025):** Days after collapse, [[UK]] sanctioned Ansari for "facilitating and supporting the hostile activities" of the Islamic [[Republic]] and IRGC.

## The self-dealing machine

**90%+ of Ayandeh's funds allegedly went to Ansari's own ventures.**

### Loan limits vs reality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Legal loan limit (based on capital) | 200 trillion rials ($187M) |
| Actual loans disbursed | **10x the limit** |
| Loans to insiders | 1.3 quadrillion rials ($1.21B) |
| Ansari's personal "loan" for Iran Mall | 740 trillion rials ($687M) |
| Repayment | **Zero** |

### [[Shell]] company network

~100 shell companies allegedly created to finance Iran Mall, granting self-serving loans never repaid.

### How it worked

```
Depositors → Ayandeh (high interest promised)
    → "Loans" to Ansari shell companies
        → Fund Ansari's real estate projects
            → Projects don't generate returns
                → Can't repay loans
                    → Ayandeh borrows from CBI
                        → CBI prints money
                            → Depositors lose via inflation
```

## What happened

**October 25, 2025:** Iranian authorities declared Ayandeh Bank bankrupt and merged it into state-owned Bank Melli.

**Immediate aftermath:**
- Panic queues across Tehran
- Bank Melli extended hours, added ATMs
- Authorities arrested individuals for "spreading rumors" online
- 7 million depositors uncertain if they'd recover savings

---

## How it operated — Ponzi dynamics

Ayandeh wasn't a bank — it was a Ponzi scheme with a banking license.

| Tactic | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Highest interest rates** | Offered best rates in Iran to attract deposits |
| **New deposits pay old** | Classic Ponzi — inflows funded outflows |
| **Illiquid assets** | Channeled deposits into real estate |
| **Central Bank borrowing** | CBI printed money to keep Ayandeh liquid |
| **Regulatory capture** | Connected to regime elites, avoided scrutiny |

**The math couldn't work:** High deposit rates require high-yield assets. Real estate is illiquid. When deposits stopped growing, the scheme collapsed.

---

## Iran Mall — the black hole

Ayandeh's biggest bet: **Iran Mall**, a colossal shopping/leisure complex west of Tehran.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ansari's "loan" for project | 740 trillion rials ($687M) |
| [[Shell]] companies created | ~100 |
| Repaid | $0 |

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Illiquid | Can't sell a mall quickly |
| Overbuilt | Iran's economy couldn't support it |
| Trapped capital | Deposits locked in concrete |
| No cash flow | Mall in collapsing economy |

When depositors wanted withdrawals, Ayandeh couldn't liquidate Iran Mall. The deposits were concrete.

---

## Systemic impact

### Contribution to Iran's problems

| Metric | Ayandeh's share |
|--------|-----------------|
| Banking system debt to CBI | ~40% |
| Annual inflation contribution | ~5% |

**Mechanism:** Ayandeh borrowed from Central Bank → CBI printed rials to lend → money supply expanded → inflation.

### Contagion risk

| Bank | Status (late 2025) |
|------|-------------------|
| **Ayandeh** | Collapsed |
| Sepah Bank | Near insolvency |
| 4 other major banks | Near insolvency |

~40% of Iran's banking system reportedly distressed.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2012 | Founded |
| 2012-2024 | Grew rapidly on high deposit rates |
| 2024-2025 | Real estate exposure becomes problem |
| Oct 25, 2025 | Declared bankrupt |
| Oct 25, 2025 | Merged into Bank Melli |
| Oct-Dec 2025 | Depositor panic contributes to rial collapse |

---

## Why it matters for rial collapse

**Confidence transmission:**

```
Ayandeh collapses (Oct 25)
    → 7M depositors learn savings trapped
        → Those with other bank deposits rush to withdraw
            → Convert rials to USD
                → Rial selling pressure
                    → Currency accelerates decline
                        → Feeds into Dec 28 crisis
```

The bank failure wasn't just about Ayandeh — it made every Iranian question whether *their* bank was safe.

---

## Ownership and connections

Privately owned by one of Iran's wealthiest families. Connected to regime elites, which allowed it to:
- Avoid regulatory intervention for years
- Continue borrowing from CBI despite losses
- Operate obvious Ponzi dynamics without shutdown

**NCRI assessment:** Part of "regime leaders' and ruling cliques' boundless plunder of Iran's people and wealth."

---

## Comparison to other bank failures

| Bank | Country | Year | Deposits | Mechanism |
|------|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Ayandeh** | Iran | 2025 | $2.34B | Real estate Ponzi |
| SVB | USA | 2023 | $175B | Duration mismatch |
| Lehman | USA | 2008 | N/A | Mortgage exposure |
| Northern Rock | [[UK]] | 2007 | £24B | Wholesale funding |

Ayandeh most resembles classic emerging market bank failures: connected elites, regulatory capture, Ponzi dynamics, real estate.

### Comparison to [[Banco Master]] ([[Brazil]] 2025)

Two [[Bank cronyism]] collapses one month apart — authoritarian vs democratic. Both linked to ~40-45 year old political structures.

| | Ayandeh | Banco Master |
|--|---------|--------------|
| **Collapsed** | October 2025 | November 2025 |
| **Deposits** | $2.34B | $7.6B (R$41B) |
| **Political structure** | Islamic Revolution (1979) — 46 years | Nova República (1985) — 40 years |
| **Owner outcome** | Protected in Iran | Arrested fleeing |
| **Who pays** | Depositors (inflation) | FGC (banks) |

**Key insight:** Same pattern, different outcomes. Both Ansari and Vorcaro were outsiders who learned to plug into mature political networks.
