## Algorithm advantage

The same recommendation algorithm powers both Douyin and TikTok:

| Personalization | Learns preferences in minutes |
| Engagement optimization | Maximizes watch time |
| Discovery | Surfaces content you didn't search for |
| Commerce integration | Recommends products based on viewing |

**This algorithm is why ByteDance won't sell TikTok** — it's the core IP.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | vs Douyin |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| [[WeChat]] (Video Accounts) | Social graph | Douyin has better discovery |
| Kuaishou | Similar model | Douyin larger, more urban |
| Xiaohongshu | Lifestyle/reviews | Douyin broader |
| Bilibili | Long-form, anime | Different audience |

Douyin is the dominant short-video platform in China.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Regulatory | Content moderation requirements, youth restrictions |
| Competition | WeChat Video Accounts has distribution advantage |
| E-commerce margins | Lower than pure advertising |
| Creator costs | Top creators demand higher revenue share |

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Douyin is a business unit of [[ByteDance]] (private).

**Indirect plays:**
- ByteDance secondary market (limited access)
- [[NVIDIA]] — ByteDance's $14B GPU order for AI/recommendation
- [[SK Hynix]] — [[HBM]] for ByteDance AI infrastructure

**Thesis:** Douyin's e-commerce growth pressures [[Alibaba]] and benefits memory/GPU suppliers.
