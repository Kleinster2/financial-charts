## Product: Skild Brain

**Unified robotics foundation model:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Omni-bodied** | Works across different robot morphologies |
| **Adaptive** | Handles unexpected scenarios (lost limbs, jammed wheels) |
| **No retraining** | Adapts to new bodies without fine-tuning |
| **Pre-trained** | Learns from human videos + physics simulations |

### Training approach

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Video learning** | Watches human videos on internet |
| **Simulation** | Practices in physics-based environments |
| **Transfer** | Applies learning across robot types |

**Key insight:** Solves robotics data scarcity by using alternate data sources instead of requiring robot-specific training data.

## Why it matters

### The robotics AI problem

| Challenge | Traditional approach | Skild approach |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Data scarcity | Train per robot type | Universal model |
| Brittleness | Fails on edge cases | Adaptive |
| Scaling | Linear (per robot) | Exponential (one model) |

### Strategic position

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Foundation model | Platform play, not point solution |
| Investor quality | SoftBank + NVIDIA + Bezos = validation |
| Enterprise first | Revenue before consumer |
| Valuation | $14B = one of largest robotics raises ever |

---

## Target markets

| Market | Timeline | Application |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Enterprise** | Now | Warehouse, manufacturing, logistics |
| **Healthcare** | Near-term | Hospital automation |
| **Consumer** | Long-term | Home robots |

**Strategy:** Enterprise tasks first → prove technology → expand to consumer.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | Valuation |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Skild AI** | Foundation model (universal) | $14B |
| Figure AI | Humanoid robots | ~$2.6B |
| 1X Technologies | Humanoid (OpenAI-backed) | ~$1B |
| Covariant | Warehouse robotics | ~$600M |
| Boston Dynamics | Hardware-focused | (Hyundai subsidiary) |

**Differentiation:** Skild is software/model layer; others are mostly hardware-focused.

## Team

| Role | Person | Background |
|------|--------|------------|
| CEO | Deepak Pathak | CMU professor, robotics AI |
| — | — | Strong CMU/academic robotics pedigree |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Foundation model = platform economics
- Best investor syndicate in robotics
- Solves data scarcity problem elegantly
- Enterprise path to revenue
- 3.5x valuation jump validates thesis

**Bear:**
- $14B valuation is steep for pre-revenue
- Robotics has long deployment cycles
- Enterprise sales cycles are slow
- Competition from well-funded humanoid plays
- Consumer robotics has failed before
