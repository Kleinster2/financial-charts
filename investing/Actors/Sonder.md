Tech-enabled hospitality company that leased apartments and boutique hotels, promising a modern alternative to traditional hotels. Went public via [[SPAC]] with [[Gores Group]] at $2.2B valuation (Jan 2022), never achieved profitability, and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2025 after a failed [[Marriott]] partnership.

## Business model

Sonder leased apartments and boutique hotel properties on long-term master leases, then operated them as short-term rentals with tech-enabled service. Design-forward aesthetic, app-based check-in, no front desk. Targeted millennial/Gen-Z travelers seeking hotel alternatives.

At peak: ~9,000 units across 40+ cities globally.

The model required constant expansion to amortize fixed lease costs. When growth stalled, the burn rate became unsustainable.

## Financial trajectory

| Year | Revenue | Net Loss | Cumulative Loss |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 2021 | $234M | -$294M | — |
| 2022 | $465M | -$245M | — |
| 2023 | $602M | -$296M | — |
| 2024 | $621M | -$224M | — |
| H1 2025 | $266M | -$101M | **~$1.4B** |

Revenue nearly tripled from 2021 to 2024, but losses never stopped. The company burned through $1B+ in cash while growing — classic "growth at all costs" until the capital markets closed.

**2025 collapse trajectory:**
- Q1 2025: Revenue $119M (-11% YoY), loss $57M
- Q2 2025: Revenue $147M (-11% YoY), loss $45M
- Bookable nights down 21% YoY as portfolio optimization (unit exits) accelerated
- RevPAR improved to $184 (+13%) but couldn't offset volume decline

## The Marriott deal that failed

**Aug 2024:** Sonder announced a licensing deal with [[Marriott]] — thousands of units would join Marriott's distribution and Bonvoy loyalty program. Positioned as a lifeline.

**Nov 2025:** Marriott terminated the agreement. Interim CEO Janice Sears blamed "unexpected challenges in aligning technology frameworks" — the integration required more investment than anticipated, and revenue declined sharply during the transition.

One day after Marriott pulled out, Sonder announced it would wind down operations immediately.

## Collapse aftermath

Guests were displaced with hours of notice. Properties closed abruptly. Staff learned of layoffs when they couldn't access buildings.

Unlike Chapter 11 (reorganization), Chapter 7 means liquidation — shareholders expected to receive nothing.

## Lessons

- **Lease-heavy hospitality is fragile** — fixed costs don't flex with demand; unlike asset-light franchisors ([[Marriott]], [[Hilton]]), operators bear the downside
- **Tech wrapper doesn't change unit economics** — app-based check-in and design aesthetics don't solve the fundamental profitability problem
- **SPAC timing matters** — went public at peak SPAC mania, never traded above $10.50; retail investors down 98%+
- **Partnership dependency is risk** — betting survival on a single integration (Marriott) created single point of failure
- **Accumulated deficits compound** — $1.4B hole by end of 2023 meant any setback was fatal

## Comparison to LuxUrban

Both Sonder and [[LuxUrban Hotels]] operated lease-based hospitality models and filed Chapter 7 in 2025:

| Dimension | Sonder | LuxUrban |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Cause | Failed integration, operational | Fraud, fake deals |
| Scale | 9,000 units, $621M revenue | ~50 units, $13M revenue |
| SPAC | Yes ([[Gores Group]]) | No (traditional IPO) |
| Warning signs | Persistent losses | Short seller exposed fabrication |

Sonder failed honestly; LuxUrban failed fraudulently. Both demonstrate lease-model fragility.
