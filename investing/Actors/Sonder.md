Tech-enabled hospitality company that leased apartments and boutique hotels, promising a modern alternative to traditional hotels. Went public via [[SPAC]] with [[Gores Group]] at $2.2B valuation (Jan 2022), never achieved profitability, and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2025 after a failed [[Marriott]] partnership.

## Business model

Sonder leased apartments and boutique hotel properties on long-term master leases, then operated them as short-term rentals with tech-enabled service. Design-forward aesthetic, app-based check-in, no front desk. Targeted millennial/Gen-Z travelers seeking hotel alternatives.

At peak: ~16,000 units (total portfolio). By Dec 2024: 9,900 live units at 195 properties across 40+ cities.

**Cost structure (2024):**
- Cost of revenue: 61% of revenue (high for "tech")
- Operations & support: 30% of revenue
- G&A: 20% of revenue

The model required constant expansion to amortize fixed lease costs. When growth stalled, the burn rate became unsustainable. Portfolio shrank 33% (16,000 → 10,700) as they exited unprofitable leases.

## Financial trajectory

| Year | Revenue | Net Loss | Cumulative Loss |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 2021 | $234M | -$294M | — |
| 2022 | $465M | -$245M | — |
| 2023 | $602M | -$296M | — |
| 2024 | $621M | -$224M | — |
| H1 2025 | $266M | -$101M | — |

**Balance sheet at bankruptcy (Dec 31, 2024):**
- Cash: $21M (down from $96M)
- Operating lease liabilities: $1.18B
- **Accumulated deficit: $1.58B**
- **Stockholders' deficit: $599M**

Revenue nearly tripled from 2021 to 2024, but losses never stopped. The company burned through $1B+ in cash while growing — classic "growth at all costs" until the capital markets closed.

**2025 collapse trajectory:**
- Q1 2025: Revenue $119M (-11% YoY), loss $57M
- Q2 2025: Revenue $147M (-11% YoY), loss $45M
- Bookable nights down 21% YoY as portfolio optimization (unit exits) accelerated
- RevPAR improved to $184 (+13%) but couldn't offset volume decline

## Going concern warning

The FY 2024 10-K (filed July 2025) contained explicit going concern language:

> "Our management has concluded there is **substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern**, which is not alleviated, for one year from the date of issuance of this Annual Report."

> "We believe that our existing cash on hand combined with our anticipated estimated Adjusted FCF **may be insufficient to fund our operations and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months**."

Management's stated plans to address the going concern:
- Engage financial advisor for strategic alternatives
- Cost optimization initiatives
- Portfolio optimization (exit underperforming properties)
- Improve revenue through Marriott integration

Four months later, they filed Chapter 7.

## The Marriott deal that failed

**Aug 2024:** Sonder announced a licensing deal with [[Marriott]]:
- Units join Marriott distribution and Bonvoy loyalty program
- Marriott invested **$15M "Key Money"** as part of the deal
- Positioned as lifeline for struggling company

**Q2 2025:** Full Marriott integration completed — all Sonder properties available on Marriott.com under "Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy" collection.

**Nov 9, 2025:** Marriott terminated the agreement, citing Sonder's contractual default. Inventory immediately removed from all Marriott channels.

**Nov 10, 2025:** Board concluded company could no longer operate as going concern. Announced immediate wind-down.

Interim CEO Janice Sears blamed "unexpected challenges in aligning technology frameworks" — integration required more investment than anticipated, revenue declined during transition.

## Timeline

## Collapse aftermath

Guests were displaced with hours of notice. Properties closed abruptly. Staff learned of layoffs when they couldn't access buildings.

Unlike Chapter 11 (reorganization), Chapter 7 means liquidation — shareholders expected to receive nothing.

## Lessons

- **Lease-heavy hospitality is fragile** — fixed costs don't flex with demand; unlike asset-light franchisors ([[Marriott]], [[Hilton]]), operators bear the downside
- **Tech wrapper doesn't change unit economics** — app-based check-in and design aesthetics don't solve the fundamental profitability problem
- **SPAC timing matters** — went public at peak SPAC mania, never traded above $10.50; retail investors down 98%+
- **Partnership dependency is risk** — betting survival on a single integration (Marriott) created single point of failure
- **Accumulated deficits compound** — $1.58B hole with $21M cash meant any setback was fatal
- **Going concern warnings are real** — 10-K explicitly flagged substantial doubt; bankruptcy followed 4 months later

## Comparison to LuxUrban

Both Sonder and [[LuxUrban Hotels]] operated lease-based hospitality models and filed Chapter 7 in 2025:

| Dimension | Sonder | LuxUrban |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Cause | Failed integration, operational | Fraud, fake deals |
| Scale | 9,000 units, $621M revenue | ~50 units, $13M revenue |
| SPAC | Yes ([[Gores Group]]) | No (traditional IPO) |
| Warning signs | Persistent losses | Short seller exposed fabrication |

Sonder failed honestly; LuxUrban failed fraudulently. Both demonstrate lease-model fragility.
