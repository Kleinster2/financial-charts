## AI bubble report (Jan 2026)

**Report thesis:** If AI bubble bursts (40% valuation drop, similar to dot-com), credit consequences would spread far beyond tech.

**Warning signs identified:**
- Strong enthusiasm behind technology
- Rapid valuation increases — even among loss-making companies
- FOMO influencing investor behavior
- Circular deals (e.g., [[OpenAI]]-[[Microsoft]])

**Sectors at risk if AI valuations drop 40%:**

| Sector | Impact mechanism |
|--------|------------------|
| **[[Banks]]** | Massive lending to private credit lenders/funds; IB and wealth management revenue hit; CRE lending exposure |
| **Tech giants** | Limited credit effects — positioned to acquire struggling startups cheaply |
| **Utilities** | Heavy data center construction investment at risk |
| **Commercial real estate** | Data center development exposure |
| **[[Media]]** | Ad spending cuts |
| **Consumers** | Wealth effect drag on spending |

**Key insight:** [[Banks]] face dual exposure — direct lending to AI companies AND indirect exposure through private credit funds they've financed.

## Data centre accounting gap warning (Feb 25, 2026)

[[Moody's]] warned that US GAAP allows hyperscalers to conceal tens of billions in potential data centre liabilities. The issue: growing use of SPVs (special purpose vehicles) to build data centres, with short-term leases and residual value guarantees.

The accounting gap:

| Threshold | GAAP standard | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Lease renewal recognition | "Reasonably certain" (~70%+ likely) | AI hardware has 4-6 year useful life, so renewal may not meet threshold |
| Residual value guarantee (RVG) | "Probable" (>50% likely) | Non-renewal RVG doesn't need to be booked if renewal is expected |
| Combined effect | Neither scenario triggers balance sheet recognition | Liability disappears from accounts |

Analysts David Gonzales and Alastair Drake: lease renewal decisions depend on "willingness to make additional investments in hardware" with 4-6 year useful life — strict GAAP application means "many lease renewals may fall below the 'reasonably certain' standard."

**Case study — [[Meta]] Hyperion:**
- SPV: "Beignet Investor," financed by [[Blue Owl]]
- Initial lease: 4 years, with options to renew up to 20
- Residual value guarantee: up to **$28B** if property value falls
- Balance sheet impact: **zero** — no liability recorded
- Meta's filing: "RVG payments are not probable and therefore, no liability has been recorded"

**Moody's response:** Will conduct independent probability assessments. "A quantitative debt adjustment would likely be made where we believe the reported lease liability understates the likely cash outflow."

This extends Moody's January AI bubble report — the same $3T data centre buildout now has an accounting opacity problem on top of the valuation risk.
