## AI bubble report (Jan 2026)

**Report thesis:** If AI bubble bursts (40% valuation drop, similar to dot-com), credit consequences would spread far beyond tech.

**Warning signs identified:**
- Strong enthusiasm behind technology
- Rapid valuation increases — even among loss-making companies
- FOMO influencing investor behavior
- Circular deals (e.g., [[OpenAI]]-[[Microsoft]])

**Sectors at risk if AI valuations drop 40%:**

| Sector | Impact mechanism |
|--------|------------------|
| **[[Banks]]** | Massive lending to private credit lenders/funds; IB and wealth management revenue hit; CRE lending exposure |
| **Tech giants** | Limited credit effects — positioned to acquire struggling startups cheaply |
| **Utilities** | Heavy data center construction investment at risk |
| **Commercial real estate** | Data center development exposure |
| **[[Media]]** | Ad spending cuts |
| **Consumers** | Wealth effect drag on spending |

**Key insight:** [[Banks]] face dual exposure — direct lending to AI companies AND indirect exposure through private credit funds they've financed.
