**Intersect Power** — Acquired by Google ($4.75B, Dec 2025). Co-located energy parks (generation + data centers).

---

## Why Intersect Power matters

Google's largest clean energy acquisition — vertical integration into power:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquirer | Google/Alphabet |
| Price | $4.75B + debt |
| Announced | Dec 22, 2025 |
| Close | Expected H1 2026 |
| Assets | Multi-GW development pipeline |

## The $4.75B acquisition

**Why Google bought Intersect:**

**The 12-year problem:** Marsden Hanna (Google Global Head of Sustainability) stated grid connection wait times exceed **12 years** in some US areas. The interconnection queue — not capital, land, or chips — is the binding constraint on AI infrastructure.

**Intersect solves this:**
- Bypass grid bottlenecks via co-location
- Secure power for AI data centers
- Vertical integration into energy
- Co-located generation + compute
- Connect at substation level, skip interconnection queue

**Deal structure:**
- $4.75B cash
- Plus debt assumption
- Intersect brand continues
- Sheldon Kimber stays as leader

**Previous relationship:**
- Google + [[TPG]] Rise Climate led $800M round (Dec 2024)
- $20B partnership target
- Led to full acquisition

## What's included

**Acquired assets:**
- Multi-GW development pipeline
- In-construction projects
- Co-located data center + power sites
- Haskell County, TX project

**NOT included:**
- Existing operating assets (TX, CA)
- Those stay with [[TPG]] Rise Climate, CAI, Greenbelt
- Split structure post-close

---

## Co-location model

**Energy parks concept:**
```
Solar generation + Battery storage + Data center
        (same site, integrated, Google-owned)
```

**Advantages:**
- No grid interconnection delays
- Direct power to data center
- Avoids transmission constraints
- Faster deployment than utility PPAs

---

## Strategic rationale

**Google's power problem:**
- AI training = massive power demand
- Grid can't keep up
- Utilities have years-long queues
- Need to control own power supply

**Vertical integration:**
- Google now develops own power
- Similar to Microsoft nuclear deals
- Amazon massive solar PPAs
- Hyperscalers becoming energy companies

---

## Operating assets

**Pre-acquisition portfolio:**
- 2.2 GW operating solar PV
- 2.4 GWh battery storage
- Mostly Texas and California
- (These assets NOT acquired)

---

## Investment implications

**For Google:**
- Secures AI power supply
- Bypasses grid constraints
- Capital deployed into hard assets
- Energy becomes core competency

**Trend:** Hyperscalers vertically integrating into power generation.
