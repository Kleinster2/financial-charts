## Jan 27, 2026: Medicare rate shock

**Stock fell ~21%** — from ~$265 to ~$210 — worst performer among managed care insurers.

Part of sector-wide [[Medicare Advantage]] rate shock — see concept note for full policy context.

### Why Humana hit hardest

**Pure-play exposure:** ~85% of revenue from Medicare Advantage (vs ~30% for UNH). Maximum sensitivity to CMS rates.

| Issue | Humana impact |
|-------|---------------|
| Flat 2027 rates | ~85% of business affected |
| Chart review rule change | Heavy reliance on risk adjustment |
| Medical cost inflation | Margins already compressed |
| Star ratings pressure | Quality bonuses at risk |

*Worst sector performer since 2020. High Medicare Advantage concentration (~85% revenue) = maximum CMS rate exposure. Down to -19% vs CI +80%, UNH +60%. vs [[UnitedHealth|UNH]], [[CVS Health|CVS]], [[Cigna|CI]], XLV.*

## Business focus

| Segment | % Revenue | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Medicare Advantage** | ~85% | Core business |
| **State-based (Medicaid)** | ~10% | Government contracts |
| **Other** | ~5% | Military, specialty |

Most Medicare-focused of major insurers.

## Medicare Advantage position

| Insurer | MA Enrollment |

| [[UnitedHealth]] | #1 |
| **Humana** | #2 |
| [[CVS Health]] (Aetna) | #3 |
| [[Cigna]] | #4 |

~5M Medicare Advantage members.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Aging population tailwind
- Healthcare services expansion
- Beaten-down valuation after 2025-26 crashes
- Simpler story than UNH

**Bear:**
- **Extreme MA concentration** (~85% revenue) = maximum CMS exposure
- Flat 2027 MA rates (0.09% vs expected 4-6%)
- Chart review rule change eliminates diagnosis mining
- Star ratings pressure (quality bonuses at risk)
- Medical cost inflation compressing margins
- No diversification into employer/Medicaid like peers

## Financials

![[hum-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue growing but margins collapsing. Q4 2024 loss (-$690M), net income declining through 2025 ($1.2B → $200M quarterly) as medical costs outpace premiums.*

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Margin |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| 2024 | $118B | $1.2B | 1.0% |
| 2023 | $106B | $2.5B | 2.4% |
| 2022 | $93B | $2.8B | 3.0% |
| 2021 | $83B | $2.9B | 3.5% |

*Margins compressing as Medicare Advantage profitability erodes.*
