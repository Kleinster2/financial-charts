| [[Microsoft]] | Dynamics 365, Copilot |

| [[Oracle]] | Enterprise apps |
| [[SAP]] | ERP, CX |

Microsoft Copilot is key competitive threat.

## Saks Global investment

Salesforce holds a minority equity stake in [[Saks Global]], acquired as part of the 2024 [[Saks-Neiman merger]] financing.

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Stake | Minority (smaller than [[Amazon]]'s 23%) |
| Context | Part of investor group for Neiman acquisition |
| Status | Equity wiped in [[Saks bankruptcy]] (Jan 2026) |

A non-core strategic investment that resulted in total loss.
