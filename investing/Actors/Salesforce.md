### Guidance and capital return

- FY2027 guide: $45.8-46.2B (+10-11%) — barely missed $46.02B consensus
- Organic growth ex-[[Informatica]] only ~7-8%

[[Claude]] integrated into Agentforce 360 — first LLM inside Salesforce trust boundary. Announced one day before earnings.

### Market reaction

Stock -5.6% AH on guidance miss despite strong beat. The gap between Q4 execution (12% growth, 25% EPS beat) and FY2027 guide (~7-8% organic) drove the sell-off.
