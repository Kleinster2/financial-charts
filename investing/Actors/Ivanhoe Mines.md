## Key assets

| Asset | Location | Ownership | Commodity | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Kamoa-Kakula | [[DRC]] | 39.6% | [[Copper]] | Producing, ramping |
| Kipushi | [[DRC]] | 68% | Zinc, germanium | Producing (restarted 2024) |
| Platreef | [[South Africa]] | 64% | PGMs, nickel, copper, gold | Development |
| Western Foreland | [[DRC]] | 90–100% | [[Copper]] | Exploration |

**Kamoa-Kakula** is the crown jewel — ultra-high grade (~5% Cu), world-class scale. Partners include [[Zijin Mining]] (39.6%) and the DRC government (20%).

## Kamoa-Kakula ramp-up

| Year | Production (kt Cu) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| 2023 | 394 | Record year |
| 2024 | ~390 | Kakula mine flooding event |
| 2025 | ~400 | Recovery year |
| 2026E | 380–420 | Dewatering continues |
| 2027E | 500–540 | Full recovery + smelter |
| Long-term | ~550 | Steady state |

The Kakula mine experienced flooding in late 2024 requiring dewatering — 70% complete on the western side, 60% on the eastern side as of late 2025. Original 2026 target was ~600kt before the flooding incident.

**Smelter:** Kamoa-Kakula's on-site copper smelter commenced operations Dec 2025, producing 99.7%-pure copper anodes at ~500 tonnes/day. Ramp to 500kt/year annualized run rate expected by end-2026. The smelter eliminates concentrate shipping costs and captures more margin.

## Kipushi

Record 203,168 tonnes of zinc in concentrate in 2025 (including monthly record 22,629t in December). 2026 guidance: 240–290kt zinc. One of the world's highest-grade zinc mines, reopened after decades of closure.

## Ownership structure

| Shareholder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| [[Robert Friedland]] | Executive Co-Chairman, founder |
| CITIC Metal | Strategic shareholder |
| [[Zijin Mining]] | 39.6% JV partner (Kamoa-Kakula) |
| Qatar Investment Authority | $500M strategic placement (2025) |

Friedland is the visionary — same person behind Voisey's Bay (nickel) and Oyu Tolgoi ([[Rio Tinto]]/Mongolia).

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (TTM) | Growing with ramp |
| Adjusted EBITDA (Q3 2025) | $87M |
| Attributable EBITDA (K-K) | $76M |
| P/E | ~56x |
| Beta | 2.02 |
| Net profit (Q3 2025) | $31M |
| Debt-to-equity | 0.18 |
| Current ratio | 4.23 |

**2025 capex:** $1,320–1,500M (K-K), lowered by $100M from original guidance. **2026 capex:** $800–1,300M (raised by $100M).

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Kamoa-Kakula on path to 550kt+ Cu — top 3 globally
- Ultra-high grade (~5% Cu) = low cost
- On-site smelter captures downstream margin
- Kipushi adds zinc diversification
- Western Foreland exploration upside (district-scale)
- Platreef PGM/nickel optionality
- Strategic backing (Qatar, CITIC, Zijin)

**Bear:**
- [[DRC]] political/operational risk (mining code changes, infrastructure)
- Kakula flooding setback — execution risk
- Heavy capex phase, limited near-term FCF
- Minority stake (39.6%) limits control at Kamoa-Kakula
- Premium valuation (~56x P/E)
- Power supply constraints in DRC
