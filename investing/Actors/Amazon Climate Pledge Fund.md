## Legal structure

Investments are held through **Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC**, a Nevada-registered investment holding company (Carson City, NV). Amazon retains full voting and investment control over all stakes held through this vehicle.

When Amazon files SEC 13G disclosures for public company holdings (e.g., [[Beta Technologies]]), NV Investment Holdings is the listed beneficial owner — but Amazon is the ultimate parent. This structure caused a misinformation-driven stock pump in Feb 2026 when traders misread a routine Beta Technologies 13G as a new investment.

## Investment thesis

Amazon's climate investments serve dual purposes:
1. **Supply chain decarbonization** — Rivian EVs, Beta Technologies eVTOL for delivery, clean fuels
2. **Net-zero commitment** — Supporting Amazon's 2040 net-zero pledge across operations

The fund is strategic, not purely financial — portfolio companies often become Amazon suppliers or partners (Rivian delivery vans being the clearest example).
