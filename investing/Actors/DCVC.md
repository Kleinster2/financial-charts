## Rare earth thesis

**Zachary Bogue (co-founder, managing partner):**
> "Rare earths are top of mind right now. There's geopolitical tensions. The US can no longer rely on [[China]] for rare earths and critical minerals."

**2025 investments:**
- [[Alta Resource Technologies]] — AI + biochemistry separation
- Second rare earth startup (undisclosed)

**View on technology:** Recent advances in mining and processing tech give confidence US startups can catch up to [[China]]'s established players.
