## Culture

See [[Dalio Principles]] for the full framework.

**Summary:** Bridgewater institutionalized [[Ray Dalio]]'s philosophy — radical truth, radical transparency, believability-weighted decisions, the Dot Collector. Born from Dalio's 1982 near-bankruptcy, these principles became the firm's operating system.

**Controversy**: Culture described as cult-like by some. High turnover in first 18 months. Either loved or hated.

| **[[China]] onshore** | All Weather Plus | +35% (2024) |

Bridgewater has significant [[China]]/[[Asia]] exposure — benefits from and vulnerable to [[China]] policy.

## Investment relevance

**Why track Bridgewater**:

1. **Macro bellwether** — When Pure Alpha thrives, macro dislocations exist. 2025 shows macro back in favor.

2. **Post-Dalio era** — Founder exited 2024. Watch if performance and culture persist.

3. **[[China]] exposure** — Significant [[Asia]]/[[China]] funds. Vulnerable to US-[[China]] tensions.

4. **All Weather as benchmark** — Risk parity strategy widely copied. Performance signals asset class correlations.

5. **AI adoption** — AIA Macro fund shows traditional macro firms adopting AI.
