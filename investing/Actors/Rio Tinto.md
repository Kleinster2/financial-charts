Rio Tinto — World's second-largest mining company. [[Iron ore]] cash cow (~70% of EBITDA) funds an aggressive pivot into [[Copper]] and [[Lithium]]. Oyu Tolgoi underground ramp-up targeting 500 ktpa copper by 2028. Arcadium Lithium acquisition ($6.7B, March 2025) makes Rio the world's third-largest lithium producer. Simandou (Guinea) first shipment December 2025. Dual-listed: LSE/ASX/NYSE.

## Price vs mining peers (since 2020)

![[rio-vs-bhp-vale-fsugy-price-chart.png]]
*Rio Tinto has closely tracked [[BHP]] since 2020, with both significantly lagging [[Fortescue]]'s higher-beta returns. The gap has narrowed in 2025-2026 as Rio's copper and lithium narrative gained traction. [[Vale]] underperformed until a sharp 2025 rally.*

## Iron ore — Pilbara operations

| Metric | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 guidance |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Shipments (100% basis) | 331 Mt | 328 Mt | 323-338 Mt |
| C1 unit cost | US$21.5/wmt | US$23.0/wmt | US$23-24.50/wmt |

18 mines connected by ~2,000 km rail network. Key assets: Gudai-Darri ($3.1B build, reached 50 Mtpa in 2024, 40+ year life), Tom Price (operating since 1966), Hope Downs (JV with Hancock/Rinehart), Mining Area C. Western Range coming online H1 2025 to replace depleting Yandicoogina/Paraburdoo.

~90% autonomous haul truck fleet. AutoHaul automated rail (world's first, 2018). Perth Operations Centre controls assets 1,500 km from the Pilbara.

Rhodes Ridge — one of the world's best undeveloped iron ore deposits. Future optionality.

### Simandou (Guinea)

| Metric | Value |

## [[Copper]] expansion

FY2024 mined copper: 697 kt (+13% YoY). FY2025 actual: 883 kt (+11% YoY, exceeded 860-875 kt guidance). Target: 1 Mtpa by 2030. [[Copper]] contributed ~15% of EBITDA (US$3.4B) in FY2024 — well behind [[BHP]] (~45%) but growing fast as Oyu Tolgoi ramps. [[Vale]]'s copper EBITDA is not yet separately disclosed.

## 2025-2026 rally (+47% in 2025)

Rio re-rated from a pure iron ore miner to a diversified copper/lithium/iron ore play — the stock rallied despite weak [[Iron ore|iron ore]] prices (~$101/t, less than half the 2021 peak). Part of a broader mining supercycle: MSCI Metals & Mining Index surged ~90% since start of 2025, beating semis, banks, and the Mag 7, driven by [[Copper]] breakout (~$6/lb, tripled from 2020), AI/data center demand, and energy transition.

**Phase 1 — new CEO + copper execution (Aug-Oct 2025):** Simon Trott replaced Stausholm in August, promising to cut costs and focus on three core groups (iron ore, aluminium, copper/lithium). Copper production exceeded 2025 guidance at 883 kt (+11% YoY). Record Pilbara shipments (326 Mt). Simandou first shipment December 2025.

**Phase 2 — [[Glencore]] merger talks (Jan 2026):** January 9: confirmed preliminary all-share merger talks — would have created a $207B+ mining giant. Stock jumped on copper consolidation narrative. February 6: talks collapsed over price and governance. Market barely flinched (Rio fell ~2.5%), suggesting investors prefer Rio standalone.

**Phase 3 — all-time highs (Feb 2026):** Hit 52-week high of $99.90. [[JPMorgan]] raised target to 8,010 GBp. Trading at 12.8x forward P/E vs 16.3x industry. Earnings due February 18.

Bear case: ING forecasts iron ore averaging $95/t for 2026, Simandou ramps to 40-50 Mt in 2027, Chinese property still declining. Iron ore is ~70% of EBITDA — the diversification narrative needs to deliver. [[Bank of America|BofA]] downgraded the European mining sector to underweight, citing risks from negative economic surprises.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Copper ramp: 697 kt → 860-875 kt → 1 Mtpa by 2030 (Oyu Tolgoi + Kennecott + Resolution)
- Arcadium makes Rio #3 lithium globally (>200 kt LCE target by 2028)
- Simandou first ore shipped — high-grade (65%+ Fe) diversifies iron ore portfolio
- Iron ore cash flow ($16.2B segment EBITDA) funds transition
- Resolution Copper permitting advancing — could be transformative (~25% of US copper demand)
- 60% payout ratio, ~$6.5B/year dividends
- EBITDA +40-50% target by 2030

Bear:
- [[China]] iron ore dependency (Pilbara is ~70% of EBITDA)
- Lithium execution risk — new to the segment, bought at 12.7x EBITDA during price downturn
- Simandou political risk (Guinea) and complex JV structure
- Capex rising sharply ($7.1B → $9.5B → ~$11B) compressing FCF
- SP10 (lower-grade) product mix elevated until replacement mines online (~end of decade)
- Mongolia political risk (Oyu Tolgoi)
- Resolution Copper still in permitting — production 7-9 years away
