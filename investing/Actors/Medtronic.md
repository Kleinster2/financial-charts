## Why Medtronic matters

**Medical device bellwether.** Medtronic manufactures over half of all pacemakers implanted worldwide. Its technologies treat 70+ health conditions across cardiac, neurological, diabetes, and surgical markets. When procedure volumes or device innovation cycles shift, Medtronic is the first to reflect it.

**Pulsed field ablation leader.** The company's cardiac ablation solutions grew 71% in Q2 FY26 on strength of PFA portfolio (Sphere-9, PulseSelect, Affela). PFA is displacing traditional RF ablation for atrial fibrillation.

## Business segments

| Segment | Q2 FY26 Revenue | Growth | Products |
|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Cardiovascular** | $3.4B | +10.8% | Pacemakers, ICDs, heart valves, PFA |
| **Neuroscience** | $2.4B | +5% | Neuromodulation, spine, brain therapies |
| **Medical Surgical** | $2.0B | +3% | Surgical tools, patient monitoring |
| **Diabetes** | ~$700M | ~4% | Insulin pumps, CGM |

Cardiovascular posted fastest growth in over a decade (excluding pandemic distortions).

## Diabetes spinoff

Medtronic announced plans to spin off its Diabetes segment, expected to close by late 2026. The unit generates ~$2.5B annually (~8% of revenue) but competes against larger players like [[Abbott]] (Libre CGM) and [[Eli Lilly]]/[[Novo Nordisk]] (GLP-1s reducing insulin demand).

## Financials (recent)

| Period | Revenue | YoY Growth | EPS |
|--------|---------|------------|-----|
| Q2 FY26 (Oct 2025) | $9.0B | +6.6% reported, +5.5% organic | $1.36 (non-GAAP) |
| FY25 | $33.5B | +4% | ~$5.30 |

FY26 analyst consensus: ~$5.70 EPS.

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Cardiovascular growth re-accelerating (PFA, structural heart)
- Hugo surgical robot could unlock new TAM
- Diabetes spinoff simplifies story
- Trading at discount to peers

**Bear case:**
- GLP-1 drugs reducing diabetes device demand
- Hugo late vs [[Intuitive Surgical]]
- Ireland HQ complicates tax situation
- Medtech growth structurally slower than pharma
