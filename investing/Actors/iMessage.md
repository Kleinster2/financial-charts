**iMessage** — [[Apple]]'s messaging service. ~1.4B users (tied to iPhone). Key ecosystem lock-in.

---

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | ~1.3-1.4B (tied to iPhone base) |
| US market share | 29% |
| [[UK]] market share | 24% |
| Global messaging share | 17% |

No official user count — Apple doesn't break out service metrics.

## Strategic importance

**Ecosystem lock-in:** iMessage is a key reason US users stay on iPhone. Green vs blue bubbles creates social pressure.

| Market | iPhone share | iMessage role |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| US | 59-60% | Primary messaging |
| [[Europe]] | ~25% | Secondary to WhatsApp |
| Global | 28% | Minor |

US-centric dominance. Irrelevant in markets where WhatsApp dominates.

## Features

- **End-to-end encryption** — between Apple devices
- **Tapbacks** — reactions
- **Effects** — animations, screen effects
- **SharePlay** — watch together
- **RCS support** — added 2024 (green bubbles now have features)

---

## Business model

**No direct revenue** — bundled with iOS. Value is ecosystem retention.

Apple's moat: users stay on iPhone partly to keep blue bubbles.

---

## RCS adoption (2024)

Apple finally added RCS support in iOS 18. Android messages now get:
- Read receipts
- Typing indicators
- Higher quality media

Still green bubbles. Social stigma preserved.
