## Why AngelList matters

AngelList democratized angel investing (for accredited investors):

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Syndicates | Pool capital behind lead investors |
| Rolling funds | Subscription-based VC funds |
| Fund admin | Back-office for VCs |
| AngelList Venture | Direct startup investments |
| Stack | Startup banking/payroll |

## How syndicates work

**Democratizing deal access:**
1. Lead investor finds deal
2. Creates syndicate on AngelList
3. Accredited investors opt-in
4. Capital pooled, single cap table entry
5. Lead takes carry (typically 20%)

**Impact:** Individuals can invest alongside top angels.
