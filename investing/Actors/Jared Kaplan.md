# Jared Kaplan

Co-founder of [[Anthropic]]. Theoretical physicist turned AI researcher. Co-authored "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (2020) with [[Sam McCandlish]] and others at [[OpenAI]] — the paper that proved model performance improves predictably with scale and gave every AI lab the roadmap to spend billions on bigger models. Previously a professor of physics at Johns Hopkins University, where his research spanned string theory and cosmology before pivoting to machine learning. Left OpenAI in early 2021 with six colleagues including [[Dario Amodei]] and [[Daniela Amodei]]. Still at Anthropic as of February 2026.
