## Stock market — 2026 breakout

[[Borsa Istanbul]] (BIST 100) has surged ~25% YTD through mid-Feb 2026, hitting consecutive all-time highs. January was the strongest month since 1997.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BIST 100 (mid-Feb 2026) | ~14,300 |
| BIST 100 (Jan 1 2026) | ~11,500 |
| 2026 YTD | ~+25% |
| 12-month return | ~+45% |
| Jan 2026 foreign net inflows | ~$2B |
| Buffett Indicator (market cap / GDP) | ~35% — fair valued |

### Drivers

- Foreign capital returning — ~$2B net inflows in January, strongest January since 1997. Banks and industrials attracted most buying: Akbank ($267M), [[Koc Holding]] ($218M), Yapi Kredi ($201M), Tupras ($200M)
- Defense sector — [[Aselsan]] up ~300% YoY, first Turkish company to exceed $30B market cap. [[NATO]] 5% GDP defense spending target by 2035 is a structural tailwind
- Banking recovery — credit activity picking up after prolonged period of ultra-high rates
- Macro stabilization — inflation trajectory declining, [[CBRT]] began easing cycle, CDS spreads tightening

*[[TUR]] (Turkey ETF) vs [[EEM]], [[EWZ]], [[INDA]] since Jan 2024. Turkey lagged EM peers through mid-2025 then surged in late 2025/early 2026 as macro stabilization thesis gained credibility. Now leading the group at ~+30%.*

## Macro trajectory

Turkey is in the early stages of an orthodox policy normalization after years of Erdogan-era unconventional easing (cutting rates amid rising inflation).

Timeline:
- Mid-2023: Policy pivot — new economic team (Simsek, Erkan) returned to orthodox tightening
- 2024: [[CBRT]] hiked to 50%, inflation peaked ~75% (May 2024)
- Late 2025: Inflation fell to ~31%, CBRT began cautious easing (100bp cuts)
- Early 2026: Foreign investors returned in force, equities rallied to record highs

Risks: Erdogan has overridden [[Central bank independence]] before (fired three governors 2019-2021). The current orthodox turn holds only as long as political patience lasts. Lira depreciation is managed but steady, which equity investors use as an inflation hedge.
