## Strategic fit with LVMH

[[LVMH]]'s Watches & Jewelry segment was weaker than fashion. Tiffany addresses this:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| American heritage | Balances Euro-centric brand portfolio |
| Bridal dominance | Counter to [[Cartier]] ([[Richemont]]) |
| Entry price points | Silver jewelry brings younger customers |
| Flagship real estate | Fifth Avenue presence |

[[Alexandre Arnault]] (Bernard's son) runs product and communications at Tiffany.

## Performance under LVMH

LVMH doesn't break out Tiffany specifically, but Watches & Jewelry segment:

| Year | Segment revenue | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| FY2024 | €10.3B | +3% organic growth |
| FY2025 | ~€10.6B (est.) | Competing with [[Cartier]] |

New flagships opened in Milan and Tokyo (2025). Competing for market share with [[Richemont]]'s Cartier.
