## Why CQE matters

**Built the ecosystem that enabled IQMP.** The $500M state investment in [[Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park]] didn't happen in a vacuum — CQE spent 7+ years building the academic-government-industry relationships that made Illinois credible as a quantum hub.

**The Bloch Tech Hub designation** (2024) — CQE led the coalition that won official US Tech Hub status from the EDA, unlocking additional federal funding.

## Leadership role in IQMP

CQE provided the foundation:
1. Built academic-industry partnerships over 7 years
2. Attracted $200M state investment (pre-IQMP)
3. Won Tech Hub designation, proving federal credibility
4. Recruited corporate partners who became IQMP tenants

Without CQE, Illinois wouldn't have been positioned for the $500M IQMP investment.

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — academic consortium.

**Watch for:**
- Additional federal funding via Tech Hub
- Corporate partner announcements
- IQMP progress (physical manifestation of CQE ecosystem)
- Startup spinouts from member institutions

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Intel]] — corporate partners
- [[Boeing]], [[JPMorgan Chase]] — end user partners
- Companies locating at IQMP
