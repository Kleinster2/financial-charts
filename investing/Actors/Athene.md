## What makes Athene, Athene

**The flywheel:** Athene collects long-duration retirement liabilities (annuity premiums, pension buyouts) → Apollo invests the float in private credit at spread → the spread compounds without needing to fundraise.

This is structurally different from traditional PE:
- PE: raise fund → deploy → return capital → fundraise again (15-20% hurdle)
- Athene: permanent capital with ~3-4% cost of capital, no redemption pressure

The result: Apollo's AUM grew from $40B (2008) to $908B (late 2025), with Athene's assets (~$430B) representing nearly half.

## History

**Founded 2009** during the financial crisis by:
- **[[Jim Belardi]]** — former President of SunAmerica Life [[Insurance]], CIO of [[AIG]] Retirement Services (managed $250B portfolio)
- **Chip Gillis** — former head of Bear Stearns [[Insurance]] Solutions Group

Sponsored by an Apollo affiliate. Thesis: post-crisis, insurers exiting fixed annuities created a void that a purpose-built platform could fill.

**Growth trajectory:**
| Year | Total assets |
|------|-------------|
| 2009 | Startup |
| 2020 | $203B |
| 2022 (merger) | $246B |
| 2024 | $360B+ |
| Sep 2025 | $430B |

## Apollo merger (Jan 2022)

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Structure | All-stock, 1.149 APO shares per ATH share |
| Implied value | ~$11B for Athene equity |
| Premium | 16.5% to last close |
| Combined market cap | ~$43B at close |
| Ownership split | Apollo 76% / Athene shareholders 24% |

Post-merger, Athene maintains a separate capital structure and credit profile. Apollo reports three segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services, Principal Investing.

[[Marc Rowan]] described the deal as creating total alignment to optimize strategy and rapidly scale origination.

### Pension risk transfer (PRT)
- Companies offload pension obligations to Athene
- Key deals: JCPenney ($2.8B, 2021), [[Lockheed Martin]] ($4.9B, 2021), Prudential ($27B)
- Leverages ACRA sidecar capital for scale

### Reinsurance
- [[Block]] reinsurance: acquiring in-force life/annuity books

### Funding agreements

- Low cost of funds for Apollo's credit platform

## ACRA sidecar

**Athene Co-Invest Reinsurance Affiliate** — Bermuda-based [[Reinsurance sidecars|reinsurance sidecar]], first of its kind in life/annuity space (2019).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACRA 1 commitments | ~$4B |
| ADIP II (ACRA 2) first close | $2B |
| Total invested assets (ACRA/ADIP) | ~$44B |
| [[Target]] float | $60B from initial $3.2B capital |

**How it works:** Third-party investors commit capital alongside Athene, sharing in PRT and reinsurance deal returns. Apollo manages the assets. ACRA has independent return hurdles — has declined Athene PRT deals that didn't meet its thresholds.

Innovation: applies ILS (insurance-linked securities) [[Reinsurance sidecars|sidecar]] model from P&C to the life/retirement space.

## 2026 retirement outlook

Athene's Jan 2026 outlook highlights:
- $4T retirement savings gap in the US
- Retirees demanding pension-like guaranteed income
- Concentrated equity exposure + potential inflation acceleration = risk for retirees
- Fixed annuities positioned as solution

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Permanent capital with low cost of funds (~3-4%)
- Secular tailwind: baby boomer retirement, pension de-risking
- \#1 market position in individual annuities
- ACRA structure multiplies capital efficiency
- Apollo integration = superior asset origination

**Bear:**
- Interest rate sensitivity (spread compression if rates fall)
- Regulatory risk (insurance capital requirements)
- Credit cycle: Apollo-managed assets could deteriorate
- Concentration risk in Apollo's investment decisions
- Competition from traditional insurers reclaiming annuity market
