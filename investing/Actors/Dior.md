## Price performance

## Corporate structure

Dior has a unique dual structure:

```
Arnault Family (Agache)
        ↓
   Christian Dior SE (CDI.PA) — publicly traded holding
        ↓
      ~42% stake in LVMH
        ↓
   Dior brand (within LVMH)
```

**Christian Dior SE** is a publicly traded company that owns ~42% of [[LVMH]]. It's how the Arnault family controls LVMH. The Dior fashion brand itself sits inside LVMH's Fashion & Leather segment.

Buying CDI.PA = leveraged bet on LVMH (trades at a holding company discount).
