## Issuance 6: Feb 10, 2026 (sterling + Swiss franc — pending)

| Currency | Maturities | Key feature |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sterling | 3-year to 100-year | [[Century Bond]] — first tech century bond since [[Motorola]] 1997 |
| Swiss franc | 3-year to 25-year | Alphabet's debut in CHF |

Sterling century bond market: only Oxford, EDF, and Wellcome Trust have previously issued. Bloomberg reports ~$9.4B equivalent across GBP + CHF, with record £24B in GBP orders.

---

## Embedded options (all issuances)

All prospectuses include standard IG make-whole call provisions:

- Redeemable in whole or part at any time at the greater of par or the make-whole price (NPV of remaining coupons discounted at Treasury + spread)
- Par call date (typically 3-6 months before maturity) — after which Alphabet can redeem at 100%
- No sinking fund
- Tax-related par call if withholding obligations arise

For the sterling [[Century Bond]]: the make-whole call is essentially worthless to the issuer at issuance (too expensive to exercise on a high coupon). The par call date is the key question — if set at year 30-40, the century bond effectively becomes a callable long bond, giving investors duration risk without full duration reward.
