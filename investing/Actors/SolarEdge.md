**SolarEdge** — Solar inverter and optimizer company. Israeli-founded. Facing severe headwinds — inventory glut, demand collapse, near-crisis.

---

## Why SolarEdge matters

SolarEdge is a cautionary tale in clean energy:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #2 inverters (behind Enphase in resi) |
| Architecture | String inverters + DC optimizers |
| Crisis | Inventory glut, demand collapse (2023-24) |
| Geography | More European exposure than Enphase |

---

## Technology approach

**String inverters + power optimizers:**
- Central inverter for array
- DC optimizers at each panel
- Lower cost than microinverters
- Panel-level monitoring

**vs Enphase:** Lower cost, but central point of failure.

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Solar | Inverters, optimizers |
| Storage | Batteries (residential) |
| e-Mobility | EV charging, powertrain (struggling) |
| Critical Power | UPS systems (acquired) |

**Diversification:** e-Mobility has been a drag on results.

## Crisis (2023-2025)

**What went wrong:**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| European demand collapse | Core market cratered |
| Inventory glut | Distributors overstocked |
| Interest rates | Solar financing harder |
| Chinese competition | Price pressure |
| Guidance cuts | Multiple disappointments |

**Stock:** Down 70%+ from peak.

## AI/Data center relevance

**Minimal direct connection:**
- Grid-scale not core focus
- Residential/commercial solar
- No direct data center play

---

## Investment case

**Bull (contrarian):**
- Oversold, crisis priced in
- Solar demand will recover
- IRA domestic manufacturing benefits
- Inventory destocking ending
- Restructuring underway

**Bear:**
- Cash burn concerns
- Competition intensifying
- e-Mobility drag
- Management credibility damaged
- Could be value trap

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | SEDG (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$1.5B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$1.5B (declining) |
| Gross margin | Compressed (~20%) |
| Cash position | Concerns raised |
| HQ | Israel (Herzliya) |

**Distressed:** Trading at fraction of peak valuation.
