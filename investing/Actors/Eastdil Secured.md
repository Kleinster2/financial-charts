## Insights

- **First real estate investment bank** — Benjamin Lambert invented the category in 1967. Still the prestige name for complex, institutional deals.
- **Private = aligned** — 2019 management buyout means partners have real skin in the game. Different from public CBRE/JLL.
- **Distressed specialist** — $100B+ in lender-assisted transactions since 2008, $7B since 2023. Current office distress is their wheelhouse.

|------|---------|-------|----------|
| [[CBRE]] | $35.8B | Full-service | Scale, workplace |
| [[JLL]] | $23.4B | Full-service | Global, LaSalle AUM |
| [[Newmark]] | $2.8B | Services + capital markets | Volume growth |

**Different market:** Eastdil competes for large institutional mandates, not for volume or market share metrics. The "Goldman Sachs of real estate."

## Investment implications

**Private company — not investable directly.**

**Signals to watch:**
- Eastdil hiring = distress opportunity expanding
- Eastdil deal flow = institutional capital moving
- Key people leaving = indicator of market shifts
