**Nexperia** — Dutch semiconductor company specializing in high-volume discrete components, logic, and MOSFETs. Owned by [[China]]'s Wingtech until Dutch government seizure in 2025.

---

## Why it matters

Nexperia is ground zero for [[EU]]-[[China]] semiconductor tensions:
- Dutch government invoked 1952 emergency law to seize control (Oct 2025)
- [[China]] retaliated with export controls on Nexperia's Chinese operations
- First nationalization of a Chinese-owned semiconductor company in [[Europe]]

## Corporate history

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2006 | Philips spins off semiconductor division as [[NXP]] |
| 2017 | NXP spins off standard products division as Nexperia |
| 2018 | Wingtech ([[China]]) acquires Nexperia for $3.6B |
| 2024 | Wingtech added to US Entity List (Dec) |
| 2025 | [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] (Oct) |

## Products

- Discrete semiconductors (diodes, transistors)
- Logic ICs
- MOSFETs and GaN FETs
- ESD protection
- [[Automotive]]-grade components

High-volume, low-margin — but critical for automotive supply chains.

## The seizure

See [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] for full details.

**Key points:**
- Dutch government used Cold War-era Goods Availability Act
- Cited "serious governance shortcomings" and technology transfer concerns
- CEO Zhang Xuezheng suspended
- [[China]] retaliated with export controls
- Wingtech shares dropped 10%

---

## Implications

- Precedent for European semiconductor nationalism
- [[Weaponized antitrust]] now cuts both ways (West seizing Chinese assets)
- [[Automotive]] supply chain disruption risk
- Template for future [[EU]] interventions
