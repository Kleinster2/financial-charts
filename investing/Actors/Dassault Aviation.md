## [[FCAS]] (6th gen)

Leading the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System ($115B program):

| Partner | Role |
|---------|------|
| Dassault | Lead aircraft designer |
| [[Airbus]] | Teaming, drones |
| Spain | Junior partner |

Competes with [[UK]]-led [[Global Combat Air Programme]] (BAE, [[Leonardo]], [[Japan]]).

**Technology sharing friction:** Dassault demands a leadership role reflecting its Rafale combat aircraft success. Berlin, which is contributing equal funding, finds this hard to accept. Paris has not intervened to bring Dassault into line. This is one of three sources of German frustration with [[France]] (alongside [[EU-Mercosur agreement]] and "buy European" protectionism), contributing to [[Friedrich Merz]]'s alignment with [[Italy]]'s Meloni and interest in [[Leonardo]] as alternative defense partner for [[Rheinmetall]]/Airbus.

**Enders critique (Feb 2026):** Former [[Airbus]] CEO Tom Enders — a German — told the FT that FCAS was a "mistake." He dismissed a domestic German fighter as "national hubris" and preferred joining the [[UK]]-led [[Global Combat Air Programme]].

**Project at risk:** Merz has cooled on FCAS. Berlin is reportedly eyeing its own fighter jet program. Franco-German tank project (MGCS) also falling significantly behind.
