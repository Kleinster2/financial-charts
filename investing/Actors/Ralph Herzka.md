**Forced transition** — Stepped aside as CEO in March 2024 after Freddie Mac barred Meridian over broker fraud allegations. Brought in [[Brian Brooks]] (former Acting Comptroller) to rebuild.

**Still involved** — Remains Senior Chairman focused on relationships and revenue growth, but no longer running day-to-day operations.
