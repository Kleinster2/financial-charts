#actor #ai #infrastructure #startup

**Daytona** — infrastructure company building programmatic, composable sandboxes for AI agents. "A computer for every agent." The new primitive for agentic work.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | — |
| HQ | New York |
| Team | ~20 people |
| Revenue | $2M+ ARR (doubled from $1M in 6 weeks) |
| Time to $1M ARR | <3 months |

## Product

**Agent-native sandboxes** — programmatic computers where CPU, memory, storage, GPU, networking, and OS are configured on demand. Key capabilities:
- Launch in **milliseconds**
- **Fork** into parallel decision branches
- **Snapshot** mid-execution (state persists across failures)
- Composable — configure resources on demand, pause, resume

**Use cases:** Code execution, [[Computer use|computer use]], reinforcement learning.

**Thesis:** Today's cloud was built for stateless production workloads, not the creative/experimental nature of agentic work. Daytona provides the missing infrastructure layer.

## Strategic context

Daytona sits at the **agent infrastructure layer** — below the model providers, below the orchestration frameworks, at the compute primitive level. As [[Agentic AI]] scales from single-task to multi-step autonomous work, agents need persistent, forkable, stateful compute environments. This is what Daytona provides.

Competitors/adjacent: [[E2B]], [[Modal]], [[Fly.io]], cloud provider sandboxes. Daytona's differentiator is agent-native design (forking, snapshotting, millisecond launch) vs. repurposed cloud containers.

Hardware-constrained — demand outpacing capacity. Using Series A to add compute and expand regions.
