**Taiwan** — Island nation. Semiconductor superpower. Geopolitical flashpoint.

---

## Why Taiwan matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | ~24 million |
| GDP | ~$800B |
| Semiconductor share | >60% global foundry |
| Key company | [[TSMC]] |

---

## Semiconductor dominance

**"Silicon shield":**
- TSMC = 90%+ leading-edge foundry
- ~65% global foundry market share
- Advanced packaging leadership (CoWoS)
- Critical to global tech supply chain

---

## Key companies

| Company | Sector |
|---------|--------|
| [[TSMC]] | Foundry (dominant) |
| [[MediaTek]] | Fabless (chips) |
| [[ASE]] | OSAT (packaging) |
| [[UMC]] | Foundry (mature nodes) |
| Foxconn | Electronics manufacturing |

---

## Geopolitical risk

**US-China flashpoint:**
- China claims Taiwan
- US ambiguous defense commitment
- TSMC = "most important company in the world"
- Chip supply = national security

**Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Status quo | Continued growth |
| Blockade | Global chip crisis |
| Invasion | Catastrophic supply disruption |

---

## CHIPS Act context

**De-risking efforts:**
- US: CHIPS Act subsidies for TSMC Arizona
- Japan: TSMC Kumamoto fab
- Europe: Dresden fab plans
- Goal: Reduce Taiwan concentration risk

But leading-edge still Taiwan-centric for years.

## Investment implications

| If stable | Taiwan companies attractive |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| If tension escalates | Supply chain risk premium |
| If conflict | Massive disruption |

Taiwan exposure = embedded in any tech portfolio.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key company | TSMC |
| Foundry share | >60% global |
| Risk | China geopolitics |
| Status | De facto independent |
