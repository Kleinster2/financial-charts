**Taiwan** — Island nation. Semiconductor superpower. Geopolitical flashpoint.

---

## Why Taiwan matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | ~24 million |
| GDP | ~$800B |
| Semiconductor share | >60% global foundry |
| Key company | [[TSMC]] |

---

## Semiconductor dominance

**"Silicon shield":**
- TSMC = 90%+ leading-edge foundry
- ~65% global foundry market share
- Advanced packaging leadership (CoWoS)
- Critical to global tech supply chain

---

## Key companies

| Company | Sector |
|---------|--------|
| [[TSMC]] | Foundry (dominant) |
| [[MediaTek]] | Fabless (chips) |
| [[ASE]] | OSAT (packaging) |
| [[UMC]] | Foundry (mature nodes) |
| Foxconn | Electronics manufacturing |

---

## Geopolitical risk

**US-China flashpoint:**
- China claims Taiwan
- US ambiguous defense commitment
- TSMC = "most important company in the world"
- Chip supply = national security

**Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Status quo | Continued growth |
| Blockade | Global chip crisis |
| Invasion | Catastrophic supply disruption |

## Tech protectionism

**Escalating crackdown on talent poaching** — intensified under President Lai Ching-te (2024).

| Date | Target | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Sep 2024 | [[Luxshare Precision]] (Grace Wang) | Arrest warrant |
| 2024 | SMIC | Raid (34 locations, 11 companies) |
| **Jun 2025** | **[[Huawei]] + [[SMIC]]** | **Blacklisted** (unprecedented) |
| Sep 2025 | **South Africa** | Chip export restrictions (diplomatic retaliation) |
| 2025 | Tokyo Electron | IP theft lawsuit |
| Jan 2026 | [[OnePlus]] (Pete Lau) | Arrest warrant |

### South Africa — first use of chips as weapon

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Trigger | SA demanded Taiwan move embassy Pretoria → Johannesburg |
| Context | 2023 BRICS summit, G20 Nov 2025 hosting |
| Action | Pre-approval required for bulk of chip exports |
| Trade value | ~$4M annual |
| SA counter | Supplies palladium for semiconductors |
| Jan 2026 | [[OnePlus]] (Pete Lau) | Arrest warrant (70+ engineers) |

### Legal tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Cross-Strait Relations Act | Prosecute illegal Chinese recruiting |
| Arrest warrants | Target executives (can't visit Taiwan) |
| Lawsuits | Hold foreign suppliers accountable |
| Export bans | Leverage chip dominance |

**Why crackdown now:** China closing tech gap, Taiwan using legal tools to protect talent moat.

## CHIPS Act context

**De-risking efforts:**
- US: CHIPS Act subsidies for TSMC Arizona
- Japan: TSMC Kumamoto fab
- Europe: Dresden fab plans
- Goal: Reduce Taiwan concentration risk

But leading-edge still Taiwan-centric for years.

## Investment implications

| If stable | Taiwan companies attractive |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| If tension escalates | Supply chain risk premium |
| If conflict | Massive disruption |

Taiwan exposure = embedded in any tech portfolio.

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key company | TSMC |
| Foundry share | >60% global |
| Risk | China geopolitics |
| Status | De facto independent |
