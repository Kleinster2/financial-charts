## [[Iranian Rial]] (IRR) — January 2026

| Rate type             | Level              | Date         |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **Market/unofficial** | 1,593,500 IRR/USD  | Jan 31, 2026 |
| Previous record       | 1,470,000 IRR/USD  | Jan 6, 2026  |
| Official              | ~1,000,000 IRR/USD | Jan 8, 2026  |

**2025-2026 collapse:**
- Started 2025: 817,500 IRR/USD
- End 2025: ~1,450,000 IRR/USD (78% depreciation)
- **Jan 2026: another 10% collapse** — from 1,455,000 (Jan 11) to 1,593,500 (Jan 31)

**Consequences:**
- Central Bank governor Mohammad Reza Farzin resigned Dec 29, 2025
- [[Inflation]] running 36-42% annualized
- Currency collapse contributed to 2025-2026 Iranian protests

**Gap analysis:** Official rate (~1M) vs market (~1.59M) = **59% black market premium**. Widening gap reflects accelerating capital flight and sanctions pressure.

## Khamenei family offshore empire

Supreme Leader's family controls significant offshore assets despite [[US sanctions]].

### [[SETAD]] — domestic wealth vehicle

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Full name | Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order |
| Founded | 1989 |
| Estimated value | $95B+ (Reuters 2013) |
| Sectors | Insurance, energy, telecoms, real estate |
| Oversight | None — answers only to Supreme Leader |

Created through post-revolution property seizures from Shah, emigres, minorities.

### [[Mojtaba Khamenei]] — offshore network

Supreme Leader's son controls separate international portfolio through intermediary [[Ali Ansari]].

| Asset class | Value | Locations |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| UK property | £100M+ | The Bishops Avenue, London neighborhoods |
| European hotels | — | Frankfurt (Hilton), Mallorca |
| UAE property | — | Dubai villa |
| **Total estimated** | **Billions** | UK, Germany, Spain, UAE, Switzerland |

**Key holding vehicles:**
- Birch Ventures Ltd (Isle of Man)
- Ziba Leisure Ltd (St. Kitts & Nevis)
- Midas Oil entities (UAE)

**Funding source:** Iranian oil sales, routed through shell companies and non-Iranian banks.

**Sanctions status:**
- Mojtaba: US-sanctioned (2019)
- Ali Ansari: UK-sanctioned (Oct 2025) — freezes UK assets

### Contradiction

State media depicts Khamenei family as austere, pious — revolutionary movement that toppled monarch in name of poor. Hidden offshore billions contradict this, fueling **aghazadeh** anger (pejorative for elite children enriching via political connections).

## Shadow oil trading networks

Despite comprehensive US sanctions, Iran exports ~$35B/year in oil through opaque trading networks.

### [[Hossein Shamkhani]] ("Hector") network

Son of [[Ali Shamkhani]] (former IRGC naval commander, defense minister, Khamenei adviser) runs one of Iran's three largest oil trading operations.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Main vehicle | [[Milavous Group]] (Dubai) |
| 2022 turnover | ~$15B |
| Ships controlled | 60+ unsanctioned, 12+ sanctioned |
| Methods | Blending, rebranding, yuan transactions |
| Hub | Fujairah (UAE) |

**How it works:**
1. Iranian/Russian crude shipped to Fujairah
2. Blended with oil from non-sanctioned countries
3. Rebranded so testing can't identify origin
4. Sold to China (yuan), India, others
5. Yuan transactions outside US dollar system

**Political protection:** Father [[Ali Shamkhani]] advises Supreme Leader. Son not personally sanctioned despite FBI/Treasury investigation.

### Why sanctions fail

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| UAE | Doesn't enforce US Iran/Russia sanctions |
| China | 90%+ of Iran's oil exports, pays in yuan |
| Blending | Origin untraceable after mixing |
| Whac-A-Mole | Sanction one entity, another replaces it |
| Oil prices | US hesitates to disrupt supply |
