## [[Iranian Rial]] (IRR) — January 2026

| Rate type             | Level              | Date         |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **Market/unofficial** | 1,593,500 IRR/USD  | Jan 31, 2026 |
| Previous record       | 1,470,000 IRR/USD  | Jan 6, 2026  |
| Official              | ~1,000,000 IRR/USD | Jan 8, 2026  |

**2025-2026 collapse:**
- Started 2025: 817,500 IRR/USD
- End 2025: ~1,450,000 IRR/USD (78% depreciation)
- **Jan 2026: another 10% collapse** — from 1,455,000 (Jan 11) to 1,593,500 (Jan 31)

**Consequences:**
- Central Bank governor Mohammad Reza Farzin resigned Dec 29, 2025
- [[Inflation]] running 36-42% annualized
- Currency collapse contributed to 2025-2026 Iranian protests

**Gap analysis:** Official rate (~1M) vs market (~1.59M) = **59% black market premium**. Widening gap reflects accelerating capital flight and sanctions pressure.
