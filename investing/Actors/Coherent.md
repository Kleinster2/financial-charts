**Coherent** — Optical components leader. 800G/1.6T transceivers. Critical for AI data center connectivity.

---

## Why Coherent matters

AI clusters need massive bandwidth — Coherent provides the optical components:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | #1 optical components |
| Products | Transceivers, lasers, modulators |
| AI exposure | 800G/1.6T pluggables |
| Key customers | Hyperscalers, network OEMs |

---

## The bandwidth problem

**AI clusters hitting copper limits:**
- GPU-to-GPU needs 400G+ per link
- [[Copper]] limited to short distances
- Optical = longer reach, higher bandwidth
- 800G now, 1.6T coming

**Coherent's solution:**
- Optical transceivers (pluggables)
- Laser sources
- Modulators
- Complete optical subsystems

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| **Transceivers** | 800G, 400G pluggables |
| **Datacom lasers** | VCSELs, EMLs |
| **[[Telecom]]** | Coherent optical modules |
| **Industrial** | Laser systems |

**1.6T roadmap:** Next-gen transceivers for AI scale.

## AI data center opportunity

**Hyperscaler demand:**
- Every GPU cluster needs optical
- 800G becoming standard
- Volume ramping aggressively
- Supply constrained

**Growth drivers:**
- AI cluster buildout
- 400G → 800G upgrade cycle
- 1.6T adoption starting 2025-26

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | Coherent vs |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| [[Lumentum]] | EMLs, ROADMs | Broader portfolio |
| II-VI (merged) | Now part of Coherent | — |
| Broadcom | Silicon photonics | More optical components |
| [[Intel]] | Silicon photonics | Traditional optical lead |

Coherent + II-VI merger created dominant optical player.
