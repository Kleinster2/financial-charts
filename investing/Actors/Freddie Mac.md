# Freddie Mac

Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that securitizes and guarantees residential mortgages.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | FMCC (OTC) |
| Status | Conservatorship since Sep 2008 |
| Regulator | [[FHFA]] |
| Market Cap | ~$6.5B (Jan 2026) |
| MBS Outstanding | ~$3.3T |

## Business Model

Essentially identical to [[Fannie Mae]]:
- **Guarantee fees**: Charges lenders to guarantee mortgage payments
- **Portfolio income**: Earns spread on retained MBS holdings
- **Does not originate loans**: Buys conforming mortgages, packages into MBS

Key difference: Freddie historically bought more from smaller lenders and thrifts, while Fannie focused on larger banks. This distinction has blurred over time.

## Conservatorship History

Same timeline as Fannie Mae:
- Sep 2008: Conservatorship
- 2008-2019: Net worth sweep to Treasury
- 2019-present: Retaining capital for potential release

## Jan 2026 MBS Purchase Directive

Part of Trump's $200B MBS purchase order alongside Fannie. See [[Fannie Mae#Jan 2026 MBS Purchase Directive]] for details.

## Notable Investors

- **Bill Ackman (Pershing Square)**: Long-term holder of preferred shares, targeting 1,200%+ returns on GSE recap trade
- **Michael Burry**: Publicly bullish on Fannie/Freddie (notable given his 2008 short fame)

## Valuation Gap

Freddie trades at significant discount to Fannie despite similar business:
- FNMA: ~$15B market cap
- FMCC: ~$6.5B market cap
- No fundamental reason for gap - likely liquidity/attention differential
- Potential convergence trade if recap proceeds
