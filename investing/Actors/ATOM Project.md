American Truly Open Models initiative to restore US leadership in open-source AI.

Led by [[Nathan Lambert]] ([[Allen Institute for AI]], ex-[[Hugging Face]]/[[Google|DeepMind]]). Evolved from the "American DeepSeek Project" launched July 2025.

## Problem

China dominates open AI: 5 of top 15 open models are Chinese ([[Alibaba]], [[DeepSeek]]). July 2025: China released 4-5 DeepSeek-caliber open models, US released zero. American labs increasingly closed.

## Core proposition

Open models are an engine for AI research — researchers build on them. Therefore, owning the best open models means the best research happens in the US, and US companies capture value from being the home of AI research.

## Plan

- Frontier open models within 6-12 months (first release early 2026)
- Multiple clusters of 10,000+ H100-class GPUs
- $100M+ budget: government funding + private infrastructure
- Focus: multilingual support, explainability, fine-tuning

## Progress

- [[Allen Institute for AI]] received $100M NSF grant over 4 years — largest CS grant NSF ever awarded
- [[NVIDIA]] supportive: Jensen Huang speaks on urgency, Nemotron models now release data
- [[Reflection AI]] announced $2B fundraise dedicated to US open models
- White House AI Action Plan includes "Encourage Open-Source and Open-Weight AI" section

## Backers

- [[Bill Gurley]] ([[Benchmark]])
- [[Jason Kwon]] ([[OpenAI]] chief strategy officer)
- [[Oleksii Kuchaiev]] ([[NVIDIA]] applied research director)
