## Why SenseTime matters

The flagship [[China]] AI company — large, public, controversial:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Hong Kong / Shanghai |
| Founded | 2014 |
| Listing | [[HKEX]]: 0020 (Dec 2021) |
| Market cap | ~$10B |
| Stock price | HK$2.51 (Feb 11) |
| Focus | Computer vision, AI platform |
| Status | US Entity List (2019) |

---

## Recent developments (Feb 2026)

### MSCI China Index inclusion (Feb 11, 2026)

Added to [[MSCI]] China Index — a catalyst for passive fund inflows. Stock rose 5.5% on the day to HK$2.51.

### SenseNova open-source models

| Model | Date | Claim |
|-------|------|-------|
| SenseNova-SI-1.3 | Feb 6, 2026 | #1 across 8 spatial intelligence benchmarks |
| SenseNova-MARS | Jan 30, 2026 | Multimodal search and reasoning breakthrough |
| SenseNova V6.5 | 2025 | #1 multimodal LLM in [[China]] (2025) |
| Office Raccoon app | Jan 14, 2026 | AI productivity app |

Pivot from pure computer vision to foundation model developer. SenseNova series positions SenseTime in the generative AI race alongside [[Zhipu]], [[DeepSeek]], [[Alibaba]].

### ACE Robotics spinout

SenseTime-backed embodied robotics startup [[ACE Robotics]] closed an angel round led by [[Ant Group]]. Co-led by SenseTime co-founder Wang Xiaogang and chief scientist Tao Dacheng. Other investors: [[Qiming Venture Partners]], GVC, [[Hony Capital]], [[Lenovo Capital]], Shanghai Jiao Tong's Lotus Capital.

### Alumni network as talent pipeline

SenseTime alumni increasingly recognized as a founder factory for [[China]] AI. Notable spinouts:
- [[Momenta]] — autonomous driving (founder Cao Xudong, ex-SenseTime R&D director)
- [[MiniMax]] — foundation models
- [[ACE Robotics]] — embodied AI

Investors tracking the SenseTime alumni network as a signal, similar to [[DJI]]'s role in Shenzhen hardware.

## Founding story

| Founder | Background |
|---------|------------|
| Tang Xiao'ou | CUHK professor, [[MSR Asia]] alumnus |
| Xu Li | CEO, Tsinghua + CUHK |
| Others | Academic researchers |

Academic origins: Spun out of CUHK computer vision lab. Research-first culture.

## Business segments

| Segment | Revenue share | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Smart Business | ~45% | Enterprise AI, retail analytics |
| Smart City | ~30% | Surveillance, traffic, public safety |
| Smart Life | ~15% | Mobile apps, photo enhancement |
| Smart Auto | ~10% | Autonomous driving, ADAS |

Revenue concentration: Smart City (surveillance) is controversial but significant.

## Technology

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Face recognition | Among world's best |
| Object detection | Top-tier |
| Video analytics | Real-time processing |
| AI platform (SenseCore) | Training + inference infrastructure |

[[Benchmark]] performance: Consistently top rankings on academic CV benchmarks.

## Entity List impact

Added to US Entity List in 2019:

| Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| US chips | Cannot purchase [[NVIDIA]] directly |
| US investors | Some divested |
| US customers | None |
| Workarounds | Domestic chips, third-party procurement |

Stock impact: IPO was delayed, priced lower. Ongoing overhang.

---

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | SenseTime advantage | Disadvantage |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| [[Megvii]] | Larger, more diversified | Less focused |
| Hikvision | Software vs hardware | Less distribution |
| [[ByteDance]] | Pure CV focus | Less data |
| Western ([[Google]], etc.) | [[China]] market access | No US market |

---

## Financial snapshot

| Metric | TTM (Jun 2025) | Trend |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Revenue | $609M | Growing |
| Gross margin | ~65% | Stable |
| Net income | Negative | Improving |
| R&D spend | ~70% of revenue | High |
| Total funding | $2.82B (10 rounds) | — |

Next earnings: March 31, 2026.

Profitability: Still losing money. Heavy R&D investment. Pivot to generative AI (SenseNova) could shift margin mix.

## Investment implications

Investable: [[HKEX]]: 0020

Bull:
- [[China]] AI leader in CV, now expanding to generative AI (SenseNova)
- MSCI China inclusion (Feb 2026) — passive fund inflows
- Platform approach (SenseCore) + open-source model strategy
- Autonomous driving optionality
- Alumni network creating ecosystem value ([[Momenta]], [[MiniMax]], [[ACE Robotics]])
- Valuation depressed by Entity List

Bear:
- Entity List overhang (since 2019)
- Surveillance exposure ([[ESG]] concerns)
- Profitability unclear — heavy R&D burn
- Late entrant to generative AI vs [[DeepSeek]], [[Zhipu]]
- Competition from Big Tech ([[ByteDance]], [[Alibaba]])

Key metrics to watch:
- Smart Auto revenue growth
- Gross margin stability
- Path to profitability
