**Centrus Energy** — Only US producer of HALEU (High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium). Critical for advanced SMRs.

---

## Why Centrus matters

Advanced SMRs need HALEU fuel. Centrus is the only US source:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Product | HALEU (19.75% enriched) |
| Position | Only US HALEU producer |
| Previous source | Russia (now sanctioned) |
| Customers | DOE, SMR developers |

---

## HALEU bottleneck

**What is HALEU?**
- Uranium enriched to 5-20% U-235
- Standard reactor fuel is <5%
- Weapons-grade is >90%
- Many advanced SMRs require HALEU

**The problem:**
- Russia was main HALEU supplier
- Sanctions cut off supply
- Centrus has only small-scale production
- DOE funding to expand

**Implication:** If SMRs take off, HALEU is a chokepoint. Centrus has near-monopoly in US.

---

## DOE contracts

Centrus has DOE contracts to:
- Produce HALEU for advanced reactor demos
- Scale up enrichment capacity
- Support national security stockpile

Government backing = revenue visibility.

---

## Production capacity

Currently limited:
- Demonstration-scale production
- Piketon, Ohio facility
- Scaling up with DOE support
- Will take years to reach commercial scale

---

## SMR customer pipeline

Every US SMR developer needs HALEU:
| Company | Reactor | HALEU need |
|---------|---------|------------|
| [[Oklo]] | Aurora | Yes |
| TerraPower | Natrium | Yes |
| X-energy | Xe-100 | Yes |
| Kairos Power | KP-FHR | Yes |

If any of these succeed at scale, Centrus benefits.

---

## Risks

- SMRs may not reach commercial scale
- DOE could fund competitors
- Russia may eventually re-enter market
- Technical/execution risk on scaling
- Small, illiquid stock

| HQ | Bethesda, MD |
| Key facility | Piketon, Ohio |
| Unique position | Only US HALEU producer |

## For theses

**Speculative chokepoint play:**
- [[Nuclear power for AI]] — HALEU needed for SMRs
- Higher risk/reward than [[Cameco]]
