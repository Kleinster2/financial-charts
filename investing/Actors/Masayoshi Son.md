## Why Masa matters

Son controls [[SoftBank]], which has made enormous AI bets:

| Investment | Size | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| [[OpenAI]] | $40B+ (Stargate JV) | Largest AI bet |
| [[xAI]] | Participated | Dec 2024 round |
| ARM | 90% ownership | $64B IPO (2023) |
| [[Helion Energy]] | $425M round | Fusion play |
| Various AI startups | $100B+ Vision Fund | Mixed results |

---

## Stargate / OpenAI

**$500B "Stargate" project (announced Jan 2025):**
- [[SoftBank]] + OpenAI + Oracle + others
- Massive AI infrastructure buildout
- [[SoftBank]] commitment: reportedly $40B+
- Largest AI investment ever announced

**The bet:** Son believes AGI is coming and is betting the company on it.

---

## ARM Holdings

**[[SoftBank]] owns ~90% of ARM:**
- Acquired 2016 for $32B
- IPO'd 2023 at $64B valuation
- Now worth $150B+
- ARM designs in every smartphone

**AI relevance:**
- ARM architecture in AI chips ([[NVIDIA]] Grace, AWS Graviton)
- Data center CPU expansion
- Licensing model = royalty stream

**Risk:** 54.6% of [[SoftBank]] value = ARM. Margin call triggers at -40%.

## Vision Fund track record

**Vision Fund 1 ($100B):**
- WeWork disaster
- Many write-offs
- Some wins (Coupang, [[DoorDash]])
- Overall: mixed at best

**Vision Fund 2:**
- Smaller, more cautious
- AI-focused investments
- Learning from VF1 mistakes

**Pattern:** Masa swings big, sometimes misses badly.

---

## AI thesis

**Son's view:**
- AGI is 5-10 years away
- Willing to lose money to be positioned
- "I'm not a genius, but I can see where the puck is going"
- Compared current moment to "Big Bang of AI"

**All-in approach:**
- Not diversified — concentrated bets
- ARM + OpenAI + AI startups
- If wrong, [[SoftBank]] in serious trouble

## Financing risk

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|

**If OpenAI struggles + ARM declines:** [[SoftBank]] could face liquidity crisis.
