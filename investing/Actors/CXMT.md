**ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT)** — Chinese DRAM manufacturer, beneficiary of IP transfer from [[Samsung]].

## Core thesis

CXMT represents China's attempt to build domestic memory capability despite [[Export controls]]. Progress has been faster than equipment bans would suggest — enabled by [[IP leakage risk|IP theft]] rather than organic R&D.

---

## Why they matter

- Largest Chinese DRAM manufacturer
- Achieved 10nm-class DRAM "at a speed that defies physics"
- Explains how: acquired Samsung's PRP process roadmap via leaked secrets
- Demonstrates limits of export controls

---

## Key event: Samsung leak (Dec 2025)

- Samsung engineer leaked 600+ process steps via handwritten notes
- Specific gas ratios, reactor pressures, photoresist parameters
- Represents 5 years and 1.6T KRW of Samsung R&D
- CXMT can now calibrate directly, skip trial-and-error

---

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| [[Samsung]] | Catching up — now has their process secrets |
| [[SK Hynix]] | Behind, but gap closing |
| Micron | Behind, but less exposed to China |

---

## Constraints

- Still subject to equipment bans (no EUV access)
- Quality/yield likely still behind Korean leaders
- Limited access to advanced packaging
- Geopolitical risk — could face further restrictions

---

## Strategic implications

| For | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| [[Samsung]] | Negative — moat eroded, competitor accelerated |
| [[SK Hynix]] | Negative — shows vulnerability, competitor rising |
| Memory pricing | Bearish long-term — more supply from China |
| [[Export controls]] | Undermined — hardware bans don't stop knowledge |

---

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

**Bearish Korea signal:**
- Chinese competition in memory intensifying
- Samsung/SK Hynix pricing power could erode over time
- IP advantage is leakier than assumed

---

## Open questions

- How quickly can CXMT scale production?
- Will quality/yield match Korean leaders?
- Is SK Hynix similarly vulnerable to IP theft?
- Will U.S. tighten controls further in response?

---

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private (state-backed) |
| Revenue (est.) | $2-3B |
| DRAM capacity | ~100K wafers/month |
| Node | 10nm-class DRAM |
| Backing | Hefei city government, national funds |
| Listed | No |
