## Arctic Shipping

Novatek uses [[Northern Sea Route]] for LNG exports:
- Year-round shipments to Asia via Arctic
- 2025: Launched *Alexey Kosygin* (ice-class LNG carrier, built at Zvezda shipyard)
- Fleet of Arc7 ice-class tankers

## Sanctions Exposure

Western sanctions have impacted Arctic LNG 2:
- Equipment delivery delays
- Train 3 pushed from 2026 → 2028
- Ship-to-ship transfers used to work around restrictions
- China remains key partner and customer

## Investment Angle

**Accessibility:** Difficult for Western investors post-sanctions. Moscow Exchange listing only.

**Bull case:**
- Dominant Arctic LNG position
- China as guaranteed offtaker
- Low-cost gas reserves

**Bear case:**
- Sanctions disrupting projects
- Ruble/Russia risk
- Limited Western capital access
