**Unconventional AI** — Brain-inspired chips (not GPUs). a16z $475M bet. Naveen Rao (ex-Databricks). Raising $1B.

---

## Why Unconventional AI matters

Biggest bet on post-GPU AI compute:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| a16z investment | $475M |
| Total raise | Up to $1B |
| Founder | Naveen Rao (ex-Databricks VP AI) |
| Thesis | Neuromorphic/analog, not GPUs |

---

## The thesis

**GPUs are not the end state:**
- GPUs = brute force matrix math
- Biological brains = far more efficient
- Brain-inspired architectures use less power
- Potential 100x+ efficiency gains

**Challenge to [[NVIDIA]]:** If it works, GPUs become legacy.

## Naveen Rao background

**Credibility:**
- VP of AI at Databricks
- Founded Nervana Systems (sold to Intel)
- Deep neural network architecture expertise
- Knows what's wrong with current approach

## Investors

| Investor | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| [[a16z]] | $475M (lead) |
| [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]] | Part of $1B |
| [[Lux Capital]] | Part of $1B |
| Future Ventures | Part of $1B |
| ROC Venture Group | Part of $1B |
| Jeff Bezos | Part of $1B |

**Signal:** Top deep tech VCs + Bezos = serious.

---

## Technology approach

**Brain-inspired computing:**
- Neuromorphic architectures
- Analog compute elements
- Sparse activation (like neurons)
- Event-driven processing

**Not new concept:** Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth tried before. Unconventional claims breakthrough.

---

## Competitive landscape

| Approach | Players |
|----------|---------|
| GPUs | [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] |
| TPUs/ASICs | Google, [[Broadcom]] |
| Neuromorphic | **Unconventional**, Intel Loihi |
| Analog | Mythic, others |

Most AI runs on GPUs/TPUs today. Unconventional betting on paradigm shift.

## Risk factors

**High-risk bet:**
- Unproven at scale
- NVIDIA ecosystem entrenched
- Software stack needed
- Manufacturing challenges
- Long timeline

**If it works:** Massive disruption. If not: expensive failure.

---

## Investment implications

**For NVIDIA:**
- Long-term threat (5-10 years?)
- Not near-term concern
- But worth monitoring

**For AI broadly:**
- Efficiency gains = more AI deployment
- Lower power = more edge AI
- Could unlock new use cases
