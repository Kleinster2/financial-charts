## Bill Pulte Era (2025-present)

Trump appointee. Grandson of homebuilder William Pulte (PulteGroup founder).

Notable positions:
- Views GSEs as tools to be "run like businesses"
- Supportive of using GSE balance sheets for policy goals
- Jan 2026: Directed $200B MBS purchase to compress mortgage spreads
- Quote: "We're focused on utilizing Fannie and Freddie in a way that no other president has"

## Policy Tension

FHFA faces inherent conflict:
1. **Safety & soundness mandate**: Build capital, reduce risk
2. **Affordability mandate**: Keep mortgage rates low, expand access
3. **Conservatorship exit**: Prepare GSEs for private market return
4. **Political pressure**: Administration wants visible housing wins

The MBS purchase directive prioritizes (2) and (4) potentially at expense of (1) and (3).

## Historical Context

- Pre-2008: OFHEO was weak regulator, missed GSE risk buildup
- 2008: FHFA created with stronger powers, immediately placed GSEs in conservatorship
- 2012-2019: Net worth sweep period - all GSE profits to Treasury
- 2019: Third amendment ended sweep, capital retention began
- 2020-2024: Various recap proposals, none executed
- 2025: Pulte appointed, more activist approach
