## Memory cost impact

**CFO Winston Cheng:**
> Cost surge is "unprecedented"

**Response — hoarding strategy:**
- Memory inventory 50% above normal levels
- Anticipating further price increases
- Locking in supply now
- Working capital tied up

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Memory exposure |
|---------|-----------------|
| **IDG (PCs)** | ~70% of revenue, high exposure |
| **ISG (Servers)** | Growing, very high exposure |
| **SSG (Services)** | Lower exposure |

PC-heavy = memory-exposed.

---

## [[China]] angle

**Additional complexity:**
- HQ in Beijing
- Some US/[[China]] trade tension exposure
- But memory suppliers are Korean/US
- Not directly export-controlled

Lenovo is a buyer, not a chip maker.

### RISC-V investment: SpacemiT

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Company | [[SpacemiT]] |
| Round | Series B (Jan 2026) |
| Total round | 600M yuan ($86M) |
| SpacemiT focus | RISC-V chips for industrial, robotics, edge |

**Strategic angle:** Lenovo investing in [[China]]'s RISC-V ecosystem — potential supplier for future devices, aligns with [[China]] silicon sovereignty push. See [[RISC-V]].

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Position |
|------------|----------|
| **Lenovo** | #1 PC, hoarding inventory |
| [[Dell]] | #2-3, raising prices |
| HP | #2-3, warning of hikes |

All large OEMs similarly squeezed.

---

## ThinkPad / Enterprise strength

**Enterprise advantage:**
- ThinkPad brand loyalty
- Enterprise can absorb price increases
- Stickier than consumer
- But still margin pressure

---

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- Memory costs = margin compression
- PC market mature
- [[China]] geopolitical risk
- Hoarding ties up capital

**Bull:**
- #1 market position
- Hoarding = supply security
- Enterprise strength
- AI PC opportunity
