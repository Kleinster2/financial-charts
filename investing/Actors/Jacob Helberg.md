**Jacob Helberg** — 22nd Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment (since October 16, 2025). The architect of [[Pax Silica]], the State Department's flagship initiative to secure AI and semiconductor supply chains among US allies. At 36, he's one of the youngest Under Secretaries in State Department history — and represents the pipeline from Silicon Valley's national security hawks directly into foreign policy.

## Career arc

Helberg's career is a masterclass in leveraging the revolving door between tech, think tanks, and government:

### Google (2016–2020)
Led Google's internal global product policy efforts to **combat disinformation and foreign interference**. Focused on protecting Google News products against state-sponsored manipulation. A mid-level policy role, but it gave him a front-row seat to information warfare — which became his calling card.

### The Wires of War (2021)
Published his book calling for a stronger US strategy against China's technological ambitions. Forbes described it as his vehicle for "leapfrogging from a mid-level role on Google's news policy team into think tank jobs" and a seat on the US-China commission. The thesis: technology is the new terrain of geopolitical conflict, and the US is losing.

### Palantir (2020–2025)
Senior Advisor to CEO [[Alex Karp]]. [[Palantir]] is the US government's most prominent AI/data analytics contractor — this positioned Helberg at the intersection of Silicon Valley and national security. He became one of the key connectors between the tech industry's China hawks and Washington policymakers.

### Think tank circuit
- **Senior Advisor**, Stanford University Center on Geopolitics and Technology
- **Adjunct Senior Fellow**, CNAS (Center for a New American Security) — Technology and National Security Program
- **Adjunct Fellow**, CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies)

### Hill & Valley Forum (founded ~2022)
Created a **bipartisan working group of Silicon Valley venture capitalists and members of Congress** focused on China's impact on the US tech industry. Met with lawmakers every couple of weeks to lobby for the TikTok ban. The forum became a key venue for the tech-defense nexus that now dominates Trump's tech policy.

### US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2022–2024)
Appointed commissioner. Used the platform to rally Congressional support for the **TikTok forced-sale bill** (Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act), which passed in 2024. This was his signature legislative achievement before joining the administration.

### White House (early 2025)
Advisor to the Council of Economic Advisors before moving to State.

### Under Secretary of State (Oct 2025–present)
Confirmed by the Senate. Immediately launched **[[Pax Silica]]** (December 2025) as his flagship initiative — a supply chain security coalition spanning the full tech stack from minerals to AI. Trump's nomination statement called him *"a champion of our America First Foreign Policy."*

## The network

Helberg sits at the center of a web connecting Silicon Valley's national security wing to the Trump administration:

| Connection | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[[Keith Rabois]]** | Husband; prominent VC (Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund); major Republican donor; early PayPal/Square/Opendoor |
| **[[Sam Altman]]** | Officiated Helberg-Rabois wedding (2018); [[OpenAI]] CEO |
| **[[Alex Karp]]** | Boss at [[Palantir]]; fellow China hawk; one of few Silicon Valley figures openly aligned with defense establishment |
| **[[Peter Thiel]]** | Palantir co-founder; Rabois is a Thiel protégé from PayPal mafia; Thiel bankrolled early Trump movement |
| **[[Sriram Krishnan]]** | White House AI adviser; both represent Silicon Valley's entrance into Trump administration |

Forbes described his rise: *"Keith had his fingerprints on some of the most prominent companies in the Valley, and growing closer to him meant becoming more firmly embedded in that culture."* Helberg wrote this himself in his book — remarkably candid about how personal connections accelerated his career.

## Political journey

Helberg is a **former Democratic donor** who switched to Republican/Trump support. Forbes titled their profile *"The Curious Rise Of Silicon Valley's Trump Whisperer — A Former Biden Donor."* He's part of the broader realignment of tech-sector China hawks from Democratic to Republican politics, driven partly by what he calls the Democratic Party's insufficient stance on China and Israel.

As a French-born, Jewish, gay man married to a prominent tech investor, he defies easy political categorization — which may be part of his effectiveness as a bridge between Silicon Valley and the MAGA coalition.

On Israel (May 2024): *"American Jews who still support Biden should have their heads examined."*

## Pax Silica — his signature initiative

Launched December 12, 2025 at the renamed "Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace" in Washington. Helberg's framing: *"If the 20th century ran on oil and steel, the 21st century runs on compute and the minerals that feed it. This historic declaration hails a new economic security consensus ensuring aligned partners build the AI ecosystem of tomorrow."*

See [[Pax Silica]] for full details on members, scope, and significance.

## Why he matters for investors

Helberg controls the State Department's economic diplomacy — the lever for:
- **Export controls** enforcement and expansion
- **Supply chain security** agreements (Pax Silica)
- **Tech investment screening** (CFIUS-adjacent)
- **AI infrastructure** diplomacy (data centers, subsea cables, compute access)
- **Critical minerals** partnerships

Any company in the semiconductor or AI supply chain — [[Nvidia]], [[ASML]], [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], [[Palantir]] — is operating in a policy environment Helberg is actively shaping. His Palantir background and VC network mean he understands both the tech and the business side, making him more effective (and more dangerous to adversaries) than a typical diplomat.

At 36, with Trump's backing and Silicon Valley connections, he could be shaping tech-geopolitics for decades.
