## Why Fermi matters

Ambitious nuclear-powered AI data center project:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | Public (Oct 2025 IPO) |
| Site | Amarillo, TX (5,236 acres) |
| [[Target]] capacity | **11GW** by 2038 |
| DC footprint | 15M sq ft |
| Nuclear reactors | 4x Westinghouse |

**Official name:** "President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus"

---

## The plan

| Phase | Timeline | Power source |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Now–2031 | Renewables + natural gas |
| Phase 2 | 2031–2038 | 4x Westinghouse nuclear reactors |
| Full build | 2038 | 11GW powering 15M sq ft |

**Scale:** ~5 Hoover Dams worth of power. DC footprint = ~half of Central Park.

## Founders (Bloomberg Billionaires, Nov 2025)

| Name | Role | Net worth |
|------|------|-----------|
| Toby Neugebauer | CEO | **$5.1B** |
| Griffin Perry | Co-founder | **$1.4B** |

**Rick Perry:** Former Texas Governor, Trump Energy Secretary. Fermi director and major backer. Griffin is his son.

**Neugebauer background:** Led GloriFi ("anti-woke" banking startup, folded). Previously Quantum Energy Partners.

## Market reaction

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| IPO (Oct 2025) | +55% first day |
| Analyst rating | 100% "buy" |
| Stock since IPO | Strong |

**Investors:** Enthusiastic despite no operating assets yet.

## Skepticism

**Red flags:**
- Company <1 year old
- No data center yet (leased site only)
- 11GW by 2038 is extraordinarily ambitious
- Nuclear buildout historically delayed, over budget
- Rhetoric ("Manhattan Project of our generation")

**The question:** Can a startup execute on nuclear-scale infrastructure?

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Nuclear solves AI power constraint
- Texas permitting favorable
- Rick Perry connections
- First-mover in nuclear DC
- Massive TAM if successful

**Bear:**
- Zero operating track record
- Nuclear timeline risk (historically 2-3x delays)
- Valuation based entirely on plans
- Execution complexity extreme
- GloriFi failure in Neugebauer's background
