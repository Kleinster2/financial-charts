## Project Matador

5,236-acre campus near Amarillo, TX on land owned by [[Texas Tech]] University System (99-year lease). Adjacent to the Pantex nuclear weapons plant. Officially named the "President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus."

**Target:** 11GW of power, 18M sq ft of AI-ready hyperscale DC infrastructure by 2038.

| Phase | Timeline | Power source | Capacity |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 2025–2027 | Gas turbines (Siemens SGT-800, SGT6-5000F) + SPS grid | ~1 GW |
| Phase 2 | 2027–2032 | Combined-cycle gas + solar + battery | Ramp to ~4 GW |
| Phase 3 | 2027–2032+ | 4x [[Westinghouse]] AP1000 nuclear reactors (~4.4 GWe) | +4.4 GW |
| Phase 4 | 2030s | Up to 2.5 GW of SMRs | +2.5 GW |
| Full build | 2038 | All sources integrated | **11 GW** |

**Scale context:** ~5 Hoover Dams. DC footprint roughly half of Central Park. More electricity than 15 US states use at peak.

## Power infrastructure progress

**Gas turbines:**
- 6x Siemens Energy SGT-800 natural gas turbines arrived Port of Houston (late 2025/early 2026) — account for ~1/3 of first GW
- 3x Siemens Energy SGT6-5000F F-class gas turbines funded by $500M MUFG loan (Feb 2026)
- Equipment arrived aboard 7 vessels from 4 countries, 36+ oversized heavy lifts, 400+ specialized semi-truck loads to transport to Panhandle

**Natural gas pipeline:** Secured pipeline connection for up to 11GW campus. Site sits near gas-rich Permian Basin.

**Grid connection:** 200 MW expected from [[Southwestern Public Service Company]] (SPS) contract.

**Water:** Amarillo City Council approved 2.5M gallons/day, 20-year contract with two 10-year renewals.

**Construction pause (Feb 6, 2026):** Paused awaiting TCEQ (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) clean air permit. CEO claimed they "completed first phase so fast" they didn't want to risk a "speeding ticket."

## Nuclear program

**Reactor choice:** 4x [[Westinghouse]] AP1000 Gen III+ pressurized water reactors, each ~1.1 GWe. Certified design — no modifications sought. Leverages lessons from [[Vogtle]] Units 3 & 4 (the only AP1000s built in the US, completed 2023 at $17B over budget, 7+ years late).

**NRC licensing:**
- COLA (Combined Operating License Application) filed June 17, 2025 — first large LWR COLA in 15+ years
- NRC accepted for review Sept 2025
- Environmental report accepted; site-specific safety data due after late 2026
- Pilot for applicant-prepared Environmental Impact Statement (testing regulatory efficiencies)

**Timeline per NRC filings:**

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Unit 1 construction start | Q2 2027 |
| Unit 1 fuel loading | H2 2032 |
| Unit 1 commercial operations | Late 2032 |
| Units 2–4 | "To be provided later" |

**Construction partner:** [[Hyundai]] Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C) — FEED contract signed. Hyundai E&C has built 24 nuclear reactors globally, 10 simultaneously, on time and on budget. EPC contract targeted by H1 2026.

**Westinghouse role:** Technical support on licensing and design integration; joint deployment strategy for nuclear portion.

## Capital structure and financing

**REIT structure:** Elected REIT status from short taxable year ending Dec 31, 2025. Must distribute 90%+ of taxable income (moot — no income). 2.5% ownership cap per entity to maintain REIT qualification.

**IPO (Oct 1, 2025):**
- 32.5M shares at $21 (upsized from 25M at $18–$22 range)
- Raised $682.5M
- First-day close: $32.53 (+55%)
- Peak market cap: ~$19B (day 1) — for a company with zero revenue

**MUFG equipment loan (Feb 10, 2026):**
- $500M non-recourse equipment facility
- Term SOFR + 4%, 18-month maturity
- Funds 3x Siemens F-class turbines ($168.3M to Siemens) + delivery/construction
- Structured as repeatable "warehouse" for future GW-scale purchases
- LTV target: 55% for undelivered equipment
- Quarterly amortization kicks in after signing ≥400 MW lease/offtake

**Total capital raised:** ~$1.6B (IPO + private financing + MUFG facility).

## Founders and leadership

| Name | Role | Background | IPO stake |
|------|------|------------|-----------|
| [[Toby Neugebauer]] | CEO, Executive Chairman | Co-founded [[Quantum Energy Partners]]; led [[GloriFi]] (bankrupt 2023) | ~$6B (family) |
| [[Griffin Perry]] | Co-founder, Senior Advisor | [[Grey Rock Investment Partners]] co-founder | ~$2.3B |
| [[Rick Perry]] | Director | Former TX Governor, [[Trump]] Energy Secretary | ~$540M (2.5% stake) |

**Neugebauer red flags:**
- [[GloriFi]] — "anti-woke" banking app, received backing from [[Ken Griffin]], [[Peter Thiel]], [[Vivek Ramaswamy]], Jeff Sprecher. Collapsed Nov 2022 after running out of money
- Bankruptcy trustee alleged self-dealing, "complete disregard for corporate governance," and "unyielding desire for singular control"
- Currently being sued by GloriFi bankruptcy trustee for securities fraud
- Limited nuclear energy or data center experience (self-admitted)
- Father is Randy Neugebauer, former US congressman (TX-19)

**Political connections:** Named campus after Trump. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum publicly endorsed. Perry was Trump's Energy Secretary. Neugebauer is a Trump donor.

## Anchor tenant loss and class action

**The $150M collapse:**
- Sept 2025: Non-binding LOI with unnamed "investment-grade" tenant
- Nov 2025: Tenant agreed to advance up to $150M for construction (AICA agreement)
- Dec 9, 2025: Exclusivity period expired; tenant terminated. No funds were drawn
- Dec 12, 2025: Fermi disclosed termination → **stock dropped 33% in one day**

**Securities class action (Lupia v. Fermi Inc., S.D.N.Y.):**
- Filed under Securities Act of 1933 (Sections 11, 15) and Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 10(b), 20(a))
- Class period: Oct 1 – Dec 11, 2025
- Alleges IPO registration statement overstated demand for Project Matador and concealed reliance on a single tenant's funding commitment
- Stock fell from $21 IPO price to as low as $8.59 (−59%)
- Lead plaintiff deadline: March 6, 2026
- Multiple firms pursuing: Robbins Geller, Hagens Berman, Bleichmar Fonti & Auld, Bronstein Gewirtz

## Competitive landscape

Fermi is **not** building reactors — it's building a campus that will host reactors built by others ([[Westinghouse]], [[Hyundai]] E&C). Its real competitors are other nuclear-adjacent AI infrastructure plays:

| Company | Approach | Status | Key difference |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Fermi** | Build 11GW campus, buy AP1000s | Pre-revenue, COLA filed | Biggest announced, least proven |
| [[Oklo]] | Build own SMRs (Aurora fast reactor) | Pre-revenue, DOE selected | Own reactor tech, Sam Altman |
| [[NuScale]] | License SMR design to others | Only NRC-certified SMR | Design company, not operator |
| [[TerraPower]] | Natrium sodium-cooled reactor | Wyoming site, Bill Gates | HALEU fuel constraint |
| [[Constellation Energy]] | Restart existing plants | Revenue-generating, TMI deal | Proven fleet, lowest risk |
| [[Vistra]] | Existing nuclear + gas fleet | Revenue-generating | Operating assets, Texas grid |

**Fermi's unique bet:** Skip SMRs entirely, go straight to proven AP1000 design at massive scale. If it works, fastest path to GW-scale nuclear DC power. If it doesn't, the most expensive failure.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Nuclear solves AI's power constraint — hyperscalers need GW-scale baseload
- AP1000 is a certified, proven design (avoids SMR technology risk)
- Hyundai E&C has best nuclear construction track record globally
- Texas permitting favorable; ERCOT deregulated
- Rick Perry political connections + Trump admin alignment
- First-mover on GW-scale nuclear DC campus
- $500M MUFG loan validates equipment procurement strategy
- Analyst consensus: Strong Buy, $29.50 target (8 analysts)

**Bear:**
- Zero revenue, zero tenants, zero operating assets
- 7 employees building an 11GW campus
- CEO's last company went bankrupt amid fraud allegations; active lawsuit
- Class action over IPO disclosures (tenant misrepresentation)
- Stock down ~50% from IPO, ~72% from peak
- Nuclear construction in the US has never been on time or on budget (Vogtle: $17B over, 7 years late)
- NRC timeline: Unit 1 commercial ops not until late 2032 at earliest
- REIT structure requires revenue for distributions — none expected until 2026 at earliest (gas phase)
- Construction paused for TCEQ permitting (Feb 2026)
- Return on assets: −1,351%; Return on equity: −2,246%
- Price-to-tangible-book: ~18,800x

**The fundamental question:** Can a year-old, 7-person company with a CEO facing fraud litigation from his last venture build the largest private energy campus in US history?
