## Technology

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Platform | NeoLink — structural proteomics data generation |
| AI models | Generative AI for molecular design (like image/video generators) |
| Approach | Design small molecules as "adapters" between proteins |
| Data gap | <5% of protein-protein interactions have structural data |

## Science: Proximity-based medicines

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Traditional drugs | Inhibit single protein (on/off) |
| Proximity drugs | Bring proteins together or pull apart |
| Molecular glues | Small molecules that bridge two proteins |
| Opportunity | Treat diseases "out of reach" for conventional drugs |

**CEO quote:** "Biology rarely works one-to-one. Proteins act in networks."

## Investment thesis (DCVC)

**Jason Pontin (DCVC partner):**
- "Unfair data advantage" in biology
- Molecular glues = "programmable biomolecular interactions"
- "AI is not magic pixie dust" — value is in proprietary datasets + fewer dead-end experiments

## NVIDIA angle

Part of NVIDIA's healthcare/pharma investment push:
- Also announced $1B Eli Lilly lab partnership (Jan 2026)
- Fresh markets for GPU compute in drug discovery
