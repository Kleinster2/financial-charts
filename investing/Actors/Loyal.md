## Strategic significance

Loyal is a Trojan horse for human longevity. Dogs age faster than humans, making them ideal proof-of-concept for anti-aging therapeutics. If LOY-002 works in dogs, the science and regulatory playbook could translate to human applications. The company is building the regulatory path for "lifespan extension" as an approvable indication — something that doesn't exist yet.

**Market:** 90M+ pet dogs in the US. $150B+ US pet industry. Pet owners increasingly willing to spend on health/longevity for animals.
