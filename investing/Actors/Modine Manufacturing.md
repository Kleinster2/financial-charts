**Modine Manufacturing** — Liquid cooling for data centers. 2024 breakout stock. AI thermal play.

---

## Why Modine matters

Liquid cooling specialist:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MOD |
| Market cap | ~$5B |
| 2024 return | +150%+ |
| Focus | Thermal management |
| Data center | Fastest growing segment |

---

## Business transformation

**From auto to data centers:**
- Legacy: Automotive thermal
- Growth: Data center cooling
- Pivot accelerating
- AI driving demand

---

## Data center products

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Coolant distribution units | Liquid cooling |
| Rear-door heat exchangers | Rack cooling |
| Chillers | Facility cooling |
| Airedale (acquired) | Precision cooling |

---

## Liquid cooling advantage

**Why liquid for AI:**
- GPU power: 700W+ each
- Air cooling insufficient
- Direct-to-chip liquid
- 10-100x better heat transfer

AI = thermal emergency.

## Airedale acquisition

**UK precision cooling:**
- Acquired 2023
- Precision cooling units
- Data center focused
- European footprint

---

## 2024 performance

**Breakout year:**
- Stock +150%+
- Data center revenue surge
- Hyperscaler wins
- Liquid cooling momentum

AI infrastructure darling.

## Customer base

| Segment | Customers |
|---------|-----------|
| Hyperscalers | Growing |
| Enterprise DC | Growing |
| Colocation | Growing |
| Automotive | Legacy, flat |

Data center = growth engine.

---

## Competition

| Competitor | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| [[Vertiv]] | Broad DC infrastructure |
| [[Schneider Electric]] | Power + cooling |
| Asetek | Liquid cooling pure-play |
| CoolIT Systems | Private, liquid cooling |

## Rubin cooling risk (Jan 2026)

**Jensen Huang CES comment hit cooling stocks:**

| Detail | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Statement | Rubin chips can be cooled in water **without a chiller** |
| MOD reaction | Stock "pounded" |
| JCI reaction | Also hit |
| Risk | Reduced need for chiller equipment |

**Eric Clark (Rational Dynamic Brands):**
> "There's certainly a risk in names that are tied to the cooling side."

**Counter-argument:** Even without chillers, liquid cooling infrastructure still needed. Modine makes coolant distribution units and heat exchangers beyond just chillers.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Liquid cooling = AI necessity
- Transformation working
- Hyperscaler relationships
- Smaller = more upside
- Beyond just chillers (CDUs, heat exchangers)

**Bear:**
- Already up 150%
- Auto legacy drag
- Vertiv/Schneider scale
- Execution on transformation
- **Rubin chiller-free cooling risk**
