## Battery cell failure — Jan 2026

Reliance halted lithium-ion cell manufacturing after [[Xiamen Hithium]] withdrew from technology licensing talks.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Partner | Xiamen Hithium (Chinese LFP supplier) |
| Cause | Beijing curbs on overseas tech transfers |
| Pivot | Refocusing on BESS assembly instead |
| Stock reaction | -1.3%, YTD -7% |

**Why it failed:**
- Internal teams concluded proceeding without Chinese tech would raise costs significantly
- Japanese, European, Korean alternatives assessed — too expensive for India scale
- Global battery overcapacity makes cost competitiveness critical

**PLI program miss:**
- Won 2022 government bid for battery cell plant (181B rupees / $2B subsidies available)
- Required 25% local value addition in 2 years, 50% in 5 years
- Penalized for missing deadlines (Mar 2025)

**Pattern:** All major Indian conglomerates (Reliance, [[Adani Group]], [[JSW Group]]) pivoting from cell manufacturing → BESS assembly due to same tech bottleneck.
