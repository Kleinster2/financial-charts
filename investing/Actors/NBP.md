**Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP)** — Poland's central bank, responsible for monetary policy and price stability. Maintains the [[Polish zloty]] as an independent currency outside the eurozone. Under [[Adam Glapiński]] (2016-present), led one of the fastest and most aggressive inflation responses globally in 2021-2022.

## Case against euro adoption

NBP's Nov 2025 report argues Poland should never adopt the euro:

### Why keep the zloty

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Independent rate-setting | Polish economy grows faster, needs different rates |
| Floating exchange rate | Absorbs shocks via currency, not unemployment |
| Faster response to crises | NBP moved 9 months ahead of ECB |
| Tailored policy | Euro area "one size fits none" |

### Why eurozone is suboptimal

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Limited labor mobility | Workers don't move freely across borders |
| No fiscal federalism | No EU-wide transfer mechanism for asymmetric shocks |
| Diverse economies | GDP per capita, debt levels, energy mix vary widely |
| Single rate for all | Cannot optimize for 20 different economies |

### Case studies of euro adoption pain

| Country | What happened |
|---------|--------------|
| **Spain** | Unemployment hit 25% in 2013; no devaluation option |
| **Lithuania** | GDP fell 14.8% in 2009 |
| **Latvia** | GDP fell 16.0% in 2009 |
| **Estonia** | GDP fell 14.6% in 2009 |
| **Slovakia** | Relative underperformance vs Poland post-adoption |

## Poland's convergence success

NBP argues staying outside the eurozone enabled Poland's catch-up:

| Year | Poland GDP per capita (% of EU avg) |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| 2000 | 48% |
| 2024 | **79%** |
| 2030s | Projected to surpass Spain, Italy |

**NBP position:** This convergence success would have been impossible with eurozone membership, which would have imposed inappropriate interest rates and removed the shock-absorbing exchange rate.

## Gold reserves

NBP has been aggressively accumulating gold:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Strategy | Active buyer |
| Rationale | Reserve diversification, sovereignty |
| Trend | Among top global central bank gold buyers |
