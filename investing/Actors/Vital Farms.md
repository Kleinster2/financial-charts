*VITL vs [[XLP]] since IPO. Massive drawdown through 2022 margin compression, then sharp recovery as profitability inflected. Currently down ~49% from Aug 2025 highs after ERP transition disrupted guidance.*

![[vitl-fundamentals.png]]
*Quarterly revenue and net income. Revenue ramping from ~$106M/quarter in mid-2023 to ~$199M in Q3 2025. Net income turned meaningful in early 2024 after near-zero profitability in 2021-2022.*

## Business model

Asset-light network: Vital Farms doesn't own farms. It partners with 575+ family farms (primarily in the South) that raise hens under strict pasture-raised standards — 108 sq ft per hen vs 2 sq ft for free-range. Vital Farms owns the processing infrastructure, brand, and distribution. Sells direct to retailers ([[Whole Foods]], [[Kroger]], [[Target]], [[Costco]]), not wholesalers.

**Products:**

| Product | % of revenue | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Shell eggs | ~88% | Pasture-raised, organic, "restorative" |
| Butter & other | ~12% | Butter (since 2015), hard-boiled, liquid eggs |

Eggs retail at $7-9/dozen vs $2-3 for conventional. Each carton traceable to the specific farm.

## Capacity expansion

| Facility | Location | Status | Capacity |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Egg Central Station | Springfield, MO | Operating; 3rd line added Q4 2025 | +30% capacity |
| Vital Crossroads (VXR) | Seymour, IN | Under construction | $350M+ rev capacity |

VXR is the critical unlock for the $2B revenue target. Expected operational 2027. Enables ~165 new farm additions.

## HPAI resilience

While [[Avian Influenza]] devastated the U.S. egg industry (100M+ birds affected), Vital Farms' decentralized small-farm model proved resilient — only 5 of 575+ farms affected since Fall 2022, each representing <0.5% of supply. Conventional egg price spikes ($5.29/dozen in Jan 2025, +50% YoY) actually narrow the premium gap to pasture-raised, improving VITL's relative value proposition.

## Linoleic acid controversy (Jan 2026)

Viral social media campaign (Dec 2025-Jan 2026) claimed Vital Farms eggs contain ~23.5% linoleic acid (omega-6) in their fat profile — comparable to canola oil — because hens eat corn/soy feed. Influencer videos framed this as greenwashing: premium "pasture-raised" eggs nutritionally similar to conventional. VITL stock dropped ~7% on Jan 20.

**Context:** The study was conducted by [[Nourish Food Club]] (competing egg brand) with [[Michigan State University]] over a year earlier. Vital Farms never hid the corn/soy feed — it's on their FAQ. The feed drives fatty acid profile, not the housing system. One egg contains ~4% of daily recommended omega-6. TD Cowen dismissed as misleading, maintained Buy/$44 target.

**What it reveals:** The brand premium rests partly on consumer assumptions about "pasture-raised" that go beyond what the label actually guarantees. The real differentiation is animal welfare (108 sq ft/hen) and traceability — not necessarily nutritional superiority over conventional eggs. This is a brand perception risk even if the science doesn't support the alarm.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only ~3% of U.S. egg volume — massive room to grow in fastest-growing egg segment
- Durable brand moat: traceability, Certified B Corp, 575+ farm network hard to replicate
- Gross margin expanding (30% → 38%) with operating leverage still early
- Capacity unlocks provide clear growth visibility through 2027
- HPAI narrowing price gap introduces new consumers to pasture-raised

**Bear:**
- Premium product ($7-9/dozen) vulnerable in recession — untested as public company in severe downturn
- ~88% revenue from shell eggs — limited diversification
- Single processing facility until VXR opens in 2027
- ERP transition (Q4 2025) impact on near-term operations still unclear
- [[Cal-Maine Foods]] relaunching in pasture-raised segment with scale advantages
- Egg price normalization could re-widen the premium gap
- Linoleic acid controversy exposed brand perception gap — premium pricing vulnerable to social media narratives
