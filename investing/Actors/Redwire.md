## Market Data (Jan 28, 2026)

- **Price:** $14.07 (+28.4%)
- **Market Cap:** $2.3B
- **52-Week Range:** $4.87 – $26.66
- **Beta:** 2.45
- **YTD Return:** +85%
- **1Y Return:** +35%
- **3Y Return:** +435%
- **Analyst Target:** $12.56 avg ($6 – $22)

## Bull Case

- Pure-play space infrastructure company riding massive defense spending tailwinds (Golden Dome, $1.5T "Dream Military" budget)
- Diversified into autonomous systems via Edge Autonomy
- Revenue scaled from $44M (2020) → $304M (2024) — 7x in four years
- Strong secular growth in space economy (commercial + government)
- Management says contract delays are timing, not lost business

## Bear Case

- **Persistently unprofitable** — never earned a profit, losses worsening (TTM net loss $208M)
- **Gross margin collapse** — from 24% (2023) to 3% (TTM), suggesting execution problems or contract mix issues
- **Massive cash burn** — TTM FCF of -$160M
- **Heavy dilution** — 42% share increase in one year
- **Negative book value** — liabilities exceed assets ($345M vs $293M)
- **SHIELD contract overhype risk** — one of 2,400+ vendors; actual revenue capture is highly uncertain
- **SPAC origin** — historically poor track record for SPAC-listed companies
- Analyst average target ($12.56) is *below* current price

## Competitive Landscape

Operates in a crowded space/defense ecosystem alongside [[L3Harris Technologies]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and smaller peers like [[Rocket Lab]], [[Terran Orbital]], and [[Mynaric]].
