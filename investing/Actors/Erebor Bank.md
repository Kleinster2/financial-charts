## Business model

Target customers:
- Tech companies in crypto, AI, defense, manufacturing
- Payment service providers
- Investment funds and trading firms
- Ultra-high-net-worth individuals in these sectors

Planned products:
- Lines of credit backed by crypto or private securities
- AI chip financing
- Specialized manufacturing equipment loans
- Stablecoin transaction facilitation
- Crypto-collateralized lending
- Traditional deposit and lending products

Digital-only delivery — mobile app and website, no physical branches. Physical vault planned — some customers want secure vaulted storage. Luckey describes it as "a farmers' bank for technology."

Luckey on product prioritization (TBPN interview, Feb 2026): products chosen entirely by customer feedback. Equipment financing (conservative) and legacy banking system integration are early priorities. Residential mortgages explicitly not on the roadmap. Goal is to not lose customers' money — "if we can do that, we'll be doing better than many other banks."

## Columbus, Ohio strategy

HQ choice ties directly to [[Anduril]]'s Arsenal-1 — a $1B autonomous weapons manufacturing facility in Pickaway County (just south of Columbus), projected to create 4,000+ jobs. Rickenbacker International Airport provides military-scale logistics. Ohio ranks #3 nationally for Air Force civilian employees and manufacturing workforce.

The combination creates a vertically integrated defense-tech-finance hub: manufacturing + specialized banking in the same metro area.

## Regulatory conditions

FDIC imposed elevated requirements reflecting the risk profile:

- 12% Tier 1 leverage ratio during first 3 years (standard minimum: 4-6%)
- Protocols for deposit account processing in event of bank failure
- Capital Call Agreement to maintain "well capitalized" status
- Approval expires if bank not established within 12 months
- Pre-opening: independent external auditor, examination, cybersecurity and AML/KYC audits

The 12% leverage requirement — double the standard — signals regulators see elevated risk even while granting the charter.

## Evolution

- 2025 — Founded by [[Palmer Luckey]] and [[Joe Lonsdale]] after crypto and defense-tech companies faced systematic debanking under Biden-era regulatory pressure. Named after the dwarven mountain fortress in Tolkien's *The Hobbit*.
- Jun 2025 — OCC charter application filed. Unusually fast track: conditional approval in ~4 months.
- Oct 2025 — OCC conditional approval granted under Comptroller Jonathan V. Gould. First de novo national bank charter of the Trump 2.0 era.
- Dec 2025 — FDIC deposit insurance approved. $350M raise at $4.35B valuation led by [[Lux Capital]].
- Feb 2026 — Full national bank charter granted.

## Political context

Debanking thesis: Crypto and defense-tech firms lost banking access under Biden-era regulatory posture. Industry labeled this "Operation Choke Point 2.0." Erebor explicitly fills that gap — purpose-built for the sectors traditional banks dropped.

Luckey's origin story (TBPN, Feb 2026): started thinking about a bank for personal use — no banks understood his businesses. [[SVB]] collapse was the specific catalyst. Realized no banks were aligned with US interests and deep tech/hard tech/energy.

Regulatory tailwind: Charter approval speed and Trump administration's stated openness to digital asset banking activities aligned with Erebor's timeline. Administration supports dollar-backed stablecoins specifically — Luckey expects most banks will be forced to adopt 24/7 stablecoin settlement within a few years.

Sovereignty posture: Erebor will comply with US law only. Luckey explicitly states they will not comply with foreign jurisdictions' rulings they deem lacking authority — positions against banks beholden to European or Chinese markets. Claims no other bank takes this position.

Intelligence community cooperation: Proactively working with US intelligence community on fraud prevention from inception (not just responding to court orders). Luckey frames this as making fraud "almost impossible" on the platform — intended to repel bad actors and attract companies that want a clean counterparty. Positions as opposite of [[HSBC]] (which banked cartels while resisting government intervention).

Own charter rationale: Without own charter, another bank or payment processor can debank you at will — or be forced to by political pressure. References Steam gaming platform's censorship chain (payment processors blaming banks blaming regulators, no one taking responsibility). Own charter means the buck stops with Erebor and they take direct responsibility for any debanking decisions.

Criticism: Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the approval "a textbook example of crony capitalism" and warned of taxpayer-funded bailout risk. Todd Baker (Columbia Business School) criticized the speed as reflecting "pay to play" dynamics.

## Risks

- Concentration risk — SVB-style single-sector exposure. If crypto markets crash or tech funding dries up, rapid deposit flight possible
- AML/BSA complexity — crypto-native banking raises anti-money laundering scrutiny
- Political amplification — founders' political associations mean every operational stumble gets amplified
- Operational risk — digital-only bank serving high-risk sectors, building compliance infrastructure from scratch
- Regulatory capture perception — political alignment between founders (major Republican donors) and approving administration
