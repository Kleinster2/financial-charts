**BYD** — Chinese EV and battery giant. Vertically integrated from cells to vehicles. **World's largest EV maker** — overtook [[Tesla]] in 2025.

---

## Why it matters

- **#1 global EV maker (2025)** — overtook Tesla
- Own semiconductor division (BYD Semiconductor) — power chips, MCUs
- Vertical integration model: batteries, chips, vehicles
- Expanding globally despite [[Export controls]] concerns
- Leading pricing pressure across China and Europe

---

## Semiconductor angle

BYD Semiconductor:
- Power semiconductors (IGBTs, SiC)
- Automotive MCUs
- Reduces reliance on [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]], [[NXP]]
- Potential IPO candidate

## Rare earth advantage

Unlike Western EV makers, BYD benefits from China's rare earth dominance:

| Advantage | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Domestic supply | 90% of rare earth magnets made in China |
| No export risk | Not subject to China's export controls |
| Cost advantage | Domestic prices 6x lower than European (2025) |

**Implication**: China's [[Rare earth leverage]] creates structural cost advantage for BYD vs [[Tesla]], [[GM]], European OEMs.

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for the broader pattern.
