**BYD** — Chinese EV and battery giant. Vertically integrated from cells to vehicles. **World's largest EV maker** — overtook [[Tesla]] in 2025.

---

## Why BYD matters

BYD represents the vertically integrated EV model:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| EV sales | #1 globally (overtook Tesla 2025) |
| Batteries | #2 globally (after CATL) |
| Semiconductors | Own power chips, MCUs |
| Integration | Cells → pack → vehicle → chips |

---

## Vertical integration model

**What BYD makes in-house:**

| Component | Status | External alternative |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| Battery cells | In-house | CATL |
| Battery packs | In-house | — |
| Power semiconductors | In-house | [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]] |
| MCUs | In-house | [[NXP]], [[Renesas]] |
| Motors | In-house | — |
| Vehicle assembly | In-house | — |

**Advantage:** Cost control, supply security, faster iteration.

## BYD Semiconductor

**Captive chip division — potential IPO:**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| IGBTs | Power conversion, motor control |
| SiC MOSFETs | High-efficiency inverters |
| Automotive MCUs | Body control, safety |
| Power ICs | Battery management |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2024 revenue | ~$2B |
| Share of BYD vehicles | ~70% of power semis |
| External sales | Growing (other OEMs) |
| IPO status | Delayed (poor market conditions) |

**Strategic value:** Reduces reliance on [[Infineon]] (global #1) and [[STMicro]].

---

## Blade Battery technology

**LFP innovation — safety + cost:**

| Feature | Blade Battery | Traditional |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Chemistry | LFP (lithium iron phosphate) | NCM/NCA |
| Safety | Nail penetration test passed | Fire risk |
| Cost | Lower (no cobalt/nickel) | Higher |
| Energy density | Lower | Higher |
| Cycle life | Longer | Shorter |

**Strategic shift:** Industry moving toward LFP for standard-range EVs. BYD pioneered the approach.

## Vehicle lineup

**Multi-brand strategy:**

| Brand | Segment | Key models |
|-------|---------|------------|
| BYD | Mass market | Han, Seal, Dolphin, Atto 3 |
| Denza | Premium | D9 MPV |
| Yangwang | Ultra-luxury | U8 SUV ($150K+) |
| Fang Cheng Bao | Off-road | Leopard 5 |
| **Linghui** | Fleet/ride-hailing | e5, e7, e9, M9 |

**Linghui sub-brand (Jan 2026):** Separates fleet/ride-hailing vehicles from core BYD brand. Many BYD cars now used as taxis in China, diluting brand perception for higher-end models like Han. Linghui re-badges existing models (Qin Plus -> e5, Sealion 06 -> e7, Han -> e9, Xia MPV -> M9). All use **Blade Battery** architecture (LFP).

| Metric | 2024 |
|--------|------|
| Total sales | ~3.5M (2024), **4.6M (2025)** |
| BEV share | ~60% |
| PHEV share | ~40% |
| Best-seller | Qin Plus |

## Global expansion

**Beyond China:**

| Region | Strategy | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Europe | Direct sales, local partners | Growing fast |
| Southeast Asia | Thailand factory | Operational |
| Latin America | Brazil, Mexico | Expanding |
| Middle East | UAE focus | Entering |
| **Nepal** | Direct sales | **Market leader** |
| US | Blocked (tariffs, politics) | No entry path |

**Key barrier:** US 100% tariff on Chinese EVs makes direct entry impossible.

### Nepal case study (Jan 2026)

BYD displaced Indian automakers in India's neighbor:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| EV share of Nepal car sales | **75%** |
| Market leader | BYD |
| Former leader | Indian gasoline/diesel cars |

Indian-made EVs struggle to compete on quality and price. Pattern may repeat across South Asia.

## Rare earth advantage

Unlike Western EV makers, BYD benefits from China's rare earth dominance:

| Advantage | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Domestic supply | 90% of rare earth magnets made in China |
| No export risk | Not subject to China's export controls |
| Cost advantage | Domestic prices 6x lower than European (2025) |

**Implication**: China's [[Rare earth leverage]] creates structural cost advantage for BYD vs [[Tesla]], [[GM]], European OEMs.

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for the broader pattern.

## Global EV market (2026)

| Market | Forecast | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **China** | 15.5M | BYD dominates |
| Europe | 4.9M (+14%) | BYD expanding |
| **US** | 1.1M (-29%) | Trump ended tax incentives |
| Global | 24M (+13%) | Slowing from 22% growth |

**BYD advantage:** China = 65% of global EV market. BYD owns home court.

## Competitive position

| vs | BYD advantage | BYD disadvantage |
|----|---------------|------------------|
| [[Tesla]] | Cost, integration, China share | Brand, US market, autonomy |
| CATL | Vehicle revenue, integration | Battery scale |
| [[Xiaomi]] | Scale, experience | Tech brand appeal |
| [[Infineon]] | Captive demand | Chip expertise, quality |

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- #1 global EV maker
- Vertical integration cost advantage
- Semiconductor self-sufficiency growing
- LFP battery leadership
- Rare earth access vs Western OEMs
- Global expansion (ex-US)

**Bear case:**
- US market blocked indefinitely
- Margin pressure from China competition
- ~~European tariff risk~~ → reduced by [[EU-China EV tariffs]] deal (Jan 2026)
- BYD Semiconductor IPO delays
- Berkshire reducing stake (signal?)
