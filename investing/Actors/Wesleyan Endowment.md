Wesleyan University's endowment, managed by the Wesleyan Investments Office (WIO) under CIO Anne Martin since 2010. $1.64B as of June 2025, up from $513M when Martin took over — $1.5B in investment gains over 15 years. A mid-sized endowment punching above its weight on long-term returns, but recent years show the cost of being benchmark-agnostic in a concentrated market.

## Performance vs benchmarks

| Period | Wesleyan | Policy benchmark | 70/30 passive | Median university |
|--------|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 15-year | **10.2%** | 9.2% | 8.3% | 8.7% |
| 10-year | 9.5% | 8.7% | 7.7% | 8.1% |
| 5-year | 11.5% | 11.2% | 9.3% | 11.0% |
| 3-year | 5.5% | 7.8% | **12.8%** | 9.3% |
| 1-year | 8.2% | 10.0% | **13.2%** | 11.6% |

Long-term alpha is real. Short-term underperformance is stark — 3-year and 1-year trail badly. The crossover happened as Mag 7 concentration drove indices.

## FY 2025 by asset class

| Asset class | Return | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Absolute return | **14.7%** | Best performer — credit dislocations, net long equity |
| Buyout | **12.0%** | Tech + industrials |
| Emerging markets | 9.9% | China helped, India dragged |
| Venture capital | 8.2% | Recovery after 2 consecutive negative years |
| Real estate | Negative | Office still depressed |
| Natural resources | Immaterial | In liquidation |

## Why FY 2025 underperformed

Three factors:

1. **No Mag 7 concentration:** Portfolio is benchmark-agnostic, manager-driven, diversified across styles/geographies. In a year where a handful of mega-cap tech drove everything, this created "meaningful relative headwinds"
2. **Biotech overweight:** Large biotech position was a "significant drag" — regulatory and drug pricing risks
3. **VC allocation (25%):** Returned 8.2% after two negative years. Recovering but still a drag vs passive alternatives. Returns are "extraordinary but episodic"

## Investment philosophy

From the FY 2025 letter:

- Long-term horizon, diversified global equity + private markets
- Reliance on skilled managers, not index replication
- "Willingness to make decisions that may not look optimal in the short run but are designed to build strength through full market cycles"
- Spending rule (2012) smooths payouts, targets long-term purchasing power preservation
- Absolute return hurdle: HEPI + 4.5% (7.3% over 15 years — comfortably exceeded)

## AI disruption acknowledgment

The endowment letter explicitly addresses AI's dual impact:
- "The rise of AI is reshaping the opportunity set in ways the investment office acknowledges it cannot fully predict"
- "The portfolio could benefit meaningfully. Or some holdings could become obsolete."

With 25% in venture (many software/tech companies) and buyout exposure to tech, the AI disruption to software business models is a direct risk. Ties to the broader [[Private credit]] software concentration concern.
