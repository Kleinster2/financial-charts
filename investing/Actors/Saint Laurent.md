## Creative leadership

| Designer | Tenure | Era |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Yves Saint Laurent | 1961–2002 | Founder, Le Smoking, Safari |

## Vaccarello era (2016–)

**Aesthetic:** Sharp shoulders, leg-baring, rock-influenced glamour. More overtly sexy than Hedi Slimane's androgyny.

**Celebrity strategy:** Aggressive red carpet presence — Zoë Kravitz, Hailey Bieber, Dua Lipa

**Results:**
- Built brand to €3.3B peak (2022)
- Now declining alongside Kering portfolio
- Q3 2025: \#1 on Lyst Index (hottest brand ranking)

**Challenge:** Revenue declining despite cultural buzz
