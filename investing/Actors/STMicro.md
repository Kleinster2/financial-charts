## Why STMicro matters

STMicro is a key EV/automotive semi supplier:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| SiC leader | \#1-2 in silicon carbide |
| Tesla supplier | Long-term SiC deal |
| MEMS | Major sensor supplier |
| European | France/Italy fabs |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Silicon carbide (SiC) | \#1-2 globally |
| MEMS sensors | \#1 globally |
| [[Automotive]] | Top 5 |
| Industrial | Strong |
| Personal electronics | iPhone sensors |

---

## Silicon carbide (SiC)

**Critical EV component:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SiC revenue | $1B+ annually |
| Tesla deal | Multi-year, multi-billion |
| Capacity | Ramping aggressively |
| Competition | Wolfspeed, Infineon, ON Semi |

**Why SiC matters:**
- Higher efficiency than silicon
- Longer EV range
- Faster charging
- Premium pricing

Tesla's SiC usage = validation for STMicro.

---

## Tesla relationship

**Strategic SiC supplier:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Deal size | Multi-billion, multi-year |
| Products | SiC MOSFETs for inverters |
| Models | Model 3, Model Y, etc. |
| Expansion | Growing with Tesla volume |

Tesla initially said they'd reduce SiC usage 75% — but still major STMicro customer.

## MEMS sensors

**\#1 globally in MEMS:**

| Sensor type | Applications |
|-------------|--------------|
| Accelerometers | Smartphones, automotive |
| Gyroscopes | Navigation, gaming |
| Microphones | [[Consumer]] electronics |
| Pressure sensors | [[Automotive]], industrial |

Apple iPhone uses STMicro MEMS sensors.

---

## European manufacturing

**Fabs in Europe:**

| Location | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Crolles, France | Advanced logic |
| Agrate, Italy | Mixed-signal |
| Catania, Italy | SiC (expanding) |
| Tours, France | Power |

European fab presence = strategic for [[EU]] sovereignty.

---

## Competitive position

| vs | STMicro advantage | STMicro disadvantage |
|----|-------------------|----------------------|
| [[Infineon]] | SiC scale, MEMS | Auto MCU breadth |
| [[NXP]] | Power/sensors | Radar, V2X |
| Wolfspeed | Volume, integration | Pure-play SiC focus |
| ON Semi | Tesla relationship | Scale |

## AWS strategic partnership (Feb 2026)

Multi-year, multi-billion USD engagement with [[AWS]]. STMicro supplies high-bandwidth connectivity, mixed-signal processing, advanced MCUs, and analog/power ICs for AWS compute infrastructure targeting AI and cloud workloads. [[AWS]] receives warrants for up to 24.8M ordinary shares at $28.38/share over 7 years, vesting tied to product purchases — a recurring [[Amazon commercial warrants|Amazon warrant playbook]]. See [[STMicro AWS deal]] for full terms.

Significant diversification — STMicro had minimal hyperscale/data center exposure prior to this deal. Stock +8% on announcement.

## FY 2025 results

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $3.33B | $11.8B |
| YoY change | +0.2% | -11.1% |
| Gross margin | 35.2% | 33.9% |
| Operating income | $125M | $175M |
| Net income | -$30M | — |
| Inventory (days) | 130 | — |
| Net financial position | — | $2.79B |

FY2025 decline driven by automotive weakness and SiC headwinds. Power & Discrete segment -31.6% YoY in Q4. Bright spots: Analog/MEMS/Sensors +7.5%, RF/Optical +22.9%. Personal electronics and comms grew.

**Q1 2026 guidance:** $3.04B revenue (-8.7% QoQ), ~33.7% gross margin (expected low point for year). ~220bps unused capacity charges. No full-year 2026 guidance given.

**2026 outlook (qualitative):** CEO Chery expects excess inventory cleared by end Q2, organic growth returning H2. Growth drivers: ADAS ASICs, SiC recovery, MEMS/imaging (+ [[STMicro acquires NXP MEMS|NXP MEMS deal]]), data center photonics, LEO satellite comms, [[Apple]] content gains. CapEx plan $2.0-2.2B.

Returned $688M to shareholders in 2025 ($321M dividends, $367M buybacks).

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | STM (NYSE), STMPA (Paris) |
| Market cap | ~$27B |
| Revenue (FY2025) | $11.8B |
| [[Automotive]] revenue | ~40% |
| Industrial revenue | ~30% |
| Gross margin | 33.9% (FY2025) |
| Net financial position | $2.79B |

![[stm-vs-ifnny-vs-on-price-chart.png]]
*STM -38% since Jan 2024, significantly lagging [[Infineon]] (+30%). ON Semi also weak — auto/power semi sector broadly under pressure, but STM is the worst performer of the three.*

![[stm-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue peaked at ~$4.5B/quarter in 2022-23, now ~$3.3B. Net income near zero as margins compress. The cyclical downturn is clearly visible.*

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- SiC leader in [[EV transition]]
- Tesla relationship validated
- MEMS monopoly in smartphones (now \#3 post-NXP deal)
- European strategic asset
- [[AWS]] deal opens hyperscale/data center TAM
- H2 2026 cyclical recovery thesis

**Bear case:**
- FY2025 showed -11% revenue decline, margin compression to 33.9%
- 130-day inventory still elevated
- No full-year 2026 guidance = limited visibility
- Tesla SiC reduction comments
- Cyclical (auto + consumer)
- Wolfspeed, [[Infineon]] competition
- 24.8M warrant dilution from AWS deal
