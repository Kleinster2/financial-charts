## Why STMicro matters

STMicro is a key EV/automotive semi supplier:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| SiC leader | #1-2 in silicon carbide |
| Tesla supplier | Long-term SiC deal |
| MEMS | Major sensor supplier |
| European | France/Italy fabs |

---

## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Silicon carbide (SiC) | #1-2 globally |
| MEMS sensors | #1 globally |
| Automotive | Top 5 |
| Industrial | Strong |
| Personal electronics | iPhone sensors |

---

## Silicon carbide (SiC)

**Critical EV component:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SiC revenue | $1B+ annually |
| Tesla deal | Multi-year, multi-billion |
| Capacity | Ramping aggressively |
| Competition | Wolfspeed, Infineon, ON Semi |

**Why SiC matters:**
- Higher efficiency than silicon
- Longer EV range
- Faster charging
- Premium pricing

Tesla's SiC usage = validation for STMicro.

## Tesla relationship

**Strategic SiC supplier:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Deal size | Multi-billion, multi-year |
| Products | SiC MOSFETs for inverters |
| Models | Model 3, Model Y, etc. |
| Expansion | Growing with Tesla volume |

Tesla initially said they'd reduce SiC usage 75% — but still major STMicro customer.

## MEMS sensors

**#1 globally in MEMS:**

| Sensor type | Applications |
|-------------|--------------|
| Accelerometers | Smartphones, automotive |
| Gyroscopes | Navigation, gaming |
| Microphones | Consumer electronics |
| Pressure sensors | Automotive, industrial |

Apple iPhone uses STMicro MEMS sensors.

## European manufacturing

**Fabs in Europe:**

| Location | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Crolles, France | Advanced logic |
| Agrate, Italy | Mixed-signal |
| Catania, Italy | SiC (expanding) |
| Tours, France | Power |

European fab presence = strategic for EU sovereignty.

## Competitive position

| vs | STMicro advantage | STMicro disadvantage |
|----|-------------------|----------------------|
| [[Infineon]] | SiC scale, MEMS | Auto MCU breadth |
| [[NXP]] | Power/sensors | Radar, V2X |
| Wolfspeed | Volume, integration | Pure-play SiC focus |
| ON Semi | Tesla relationship | Scale |

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | STM (NYSE), STMPA (Paris) |
| Market cap | ~$25B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$13B |
| Automotive revenue | ~40% |
| Industrial revenue | ~30% |
| Gross margin | ~40% |
| P/E | ~10x |

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- SiC leader in EV transition
- Tesla relationship validated
- MEMS monopoly in smartphones
- European strategic asset

**Bear case:**
- Tesla SiC reduction comments
- Cyclical (auto + consumer)
- Wolfspeed, Infineon competition
- Capacity expansion risk
