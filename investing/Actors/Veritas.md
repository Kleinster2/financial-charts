**Veritas** — startup building custom "hack-proof" NFC microchips embedded in luxury goods for authentication. Combines hardware (custom chip) + software (digital certificates, blockchain, backend analytics) to fight counterfeiting.

## The problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Counterfeiting losses | $30B/year for luxury brands |
| Second-hand luxury market | $210B and growing |
| "Superfakes" | Fakes so good some maisons stopped authenticating — can't reliably distinguish from genuine |

Traditional authentication (symbols, physical marks, certificates) has been defeated by sophisticated counterfeiters. Blockchain certificates and serial number databases are also routinely cracked.

## Product

Custom NFC microchip the size of a small gem, inserted into luxury goods during or after manufacturing:
- **Tap to verify** — smartphone NFC reads chip, confirms authenticity
- **Tamper-resistant** — custom coil + bridge structure; chip goes dormant and hides codes if tampered with
- **Flipper Zero-proof** — claims immunity to common hacking tools
- **Backend analytics** — monitors scanning behavior to detect fraud patterns
- **Blockchain digital twin** — digital clone for metaverse/digital art gallery use
- **Brand suite** — software dashboard for managing chipped products, team access, customer engagement (exclusive invitations, early access)

**Key insight from founder:** Automotive-grade security tech (from Holland's Tesla background) applied to luxury goods — a hardware-first approach vs. pure software/blockchain solutions.

---

## Strategic context

Luxury authentication is a growing market as second-hand luxury explodes ($210B). Existing solutions (Entrupy AI image analysis, Certilogo, blockchain certificates) are software-only — Veritas bets that hardware-embedded security is fundamentally harder to defeat. The chip physically lives inside the product.

**Customers:** Not disclosed, but working with "maisons" (established luxury fashion houses).
