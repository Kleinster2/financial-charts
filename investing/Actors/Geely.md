## US market ambitions (Jan 2026)

**Geely signaling US entry within 3 years:**

> "The big question for us is when and where we will go to the USA."
> — Ash Sutcliffe, Head of Global Communications

**Context:**
- Trump (Jan 2026): "I love" Chinese companies building US plants
- [[Ford]] holding talks with [[Xiaomi]], [[BYD]] about JVs
- 100% tariff blocks direct imports — must manufacture locally

**Existing US presence:**
- Polestar already sells in US (Swedish brand, Chinese parent)
- Volvo has US manufacturing (South Carolina)

Geely could potentially use Volvo/Polestar infrastructure as Trojan horse.

### Mexico plant bid (Feb 2026)

Geely is one of three finalists (with [[BYD]] and [[VinFast]]) to acquire the 230,000-unit [[COMPAS Mexico plant sale 2026|COMPAS factory]] in [[Aguascalientes]], [[Mexico]] — a $1B [[Nissan]]-[[Mercedes-Benz]] JV plant closing May 2026. Would complement Geely's existing North American footprint via [[Volvo Cars]] (South Carolina factory) and [[Polestar]] (US sales). 230K-unit capacity could serve both Mexican domestic market (~10% Chinese share, up from 0% in 2020) and potential USMCA-routed US exports.
