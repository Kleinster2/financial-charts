## Aesthetic

Described as intersection of:

- **Balletcore** — flats, leg warmers
- **Gorpcore** — fleece, outdoor utility

Compared to Simone Rocha, [[Miu Miu]]. Draws from Chinatown grandmothers, childhood nostalgia, "unsung neighborhood spirit."

## Investment case

**Strengths:**
- Cult brand with authentic NYC roots
- Collaboration machine — proven mass market appeal (Target, Gap)
- K-pop/celebrity organic adoption
- Category expansion (footwear, bags, bridal)

**Weaknesses:**
- Tiny scale (~$1.8M revenue)
- No known outside funding
- Founder-dependent
- Trend-exposed (coquette cycle risk)

Could be acquisition target for larger fashion group seeking downtown credibility.
