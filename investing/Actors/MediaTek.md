**MediaTek** — Taiwan-based fabless chip designer, #4 globally. Mobile SoCs, smart home, automotive.

---

## Relevance to semis

MediaTek is emerging as a potential partner for hyperscalers seeking to disintermediate [[Broadcom]].

---

## Hyperscaler design wins

MediaTek emerging as Broadcom alternative across multiple hyperscalers:

| Customer | Chip | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| [[Google]] | TPUv7e (A5921) | IC design |
| [[Google]] | TPUv8e | IC design* |
| [[Microsoft]] | Maia 400 | IC design* (with GUC/Marvell) |
| Bytedance | APU | IC design |

*To be confirmed. Source: [[Hyperscaler chip roadmap]]

**This is no longer just Google** — MediaTek is becoming a real Broadcom alternative.

---

## Google relationship (original)

Google's TPUv8 "Zebrafish" path uses MediaTek for supporting chips as Google attempts to bypass [[Broadcom]]'s ~55% gross margin.

If Google succeeds, MediaTek becomes a pick for the "hyperscaler vertical integration" trend.

## Market position

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Mobile SoCs | #2 (behind Qualcomm) |
| Smart home | Leader |
| Automotive | Growing |

---

## Foundry relationship

Primary customer of [[TSMC]]. Taiwan-to-Taiwan supply chain.

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2454.TW |
| HQ | Hsinchu, Taiwan |
| Primary foundry | [[TSMC]] |

---

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: MediaTek = TSMC customer
**Broadcom risk**: If hyperscalers shift to MediaTek, bearish [[Broadcom]]
