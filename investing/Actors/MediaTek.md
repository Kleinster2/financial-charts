**MediaTek** — Taiwan fabless chip designer, #4 globally. Mobile SoCs (#2 after Qualcomm), emerging as [[Broadcom]] alternative for hyperscaler ASICs.

---

## Why MediaTek matters

MediaTek is becoming the anti-Broadcom for hyperscalers:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Mobile SoCs | #2 globally (after Qualcomm) |
| Hyperscaler ASICs | Google, Microsoft, ByteDance |
| Automotive | Growing segment |
| Foundry | TSMC customer (Taiwan-to-Taiwan) |

---

## Hyperscaler disintermediation play

**Becoming the Broadcom alternative:**

| Customer | Chip | Role | Status |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| [[Google]] | TPUv7e (A5921) | IC design | Confirmed |
| [[Google]] | TPUv8 (Zebrafish) | Supporting chips | In development |
| [[Microsoft]] | Maia | Design partner | Reported |
| ByteDance | APU | IC design | Confirmed |

**Why hyperscalers want MediaTek:**
- Broadcom takes ~55% gross margin on custom ASICs
- MediaTek offers lower-cost alternative
- ASIC design expertise from mobile SoCs

See [[Hyperscaler disintermediation]] for thesis context.

## Google relationship

**TPU disintermediation:**

| Path | Partner | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| Sunfish | Broadcom | Status quo (high margin) |
| **Zebrafish** | MediaTek + direct | Bypass Broadcom |

Google's TPUv8 "Zebrafish" uses MediaTek for supporting chips as Google attempts to reduce Broadcom's ~$15B/yr "tax."

**Implication:** If Google succeeds, MediaTek becomes a pick for the hyperscaler vertical integration trend.

## Mobile SoC business

**Core business (#2 globally):**

| Segment | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Mobile SoCs | #2 (after Qualcomm) |
| Market share | ~35% of Android |
| Segments | Flagship, mid-range, budget |
| Key product | Dimensity series |

| Tier | Product | Customers |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Flagship | Dimensity 9000+ | Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi |
| Mid-range | Dimensity 7000 | Mass market |
| Budget | Helio | Emerging markets |

---

## Smart home / IoT

**#1 in smart home:**

| Product | Applications |
|---------|--------------|
| WiFi chips | Routers, access points |
| TV SoCs | Smart TVs |
| IoT modules | Connected devices |

Strong position in connectivity and edge devices.

---

## Automotive expansion

**Growing segment:**

| Focus | Products |
|-------|----------|
| Infotainment | Multimedia SoCs |
| Connectivity | 5G, V2X |
| ADAS | Compute modules |

Less mature than [[NXP]], [[Infineon]] but growing.

---

## TSMC relationship

**Taiwan-to-Taiwan supply chain:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Primary foundry | [[TSMC]] |
| Nodes | 3nm, 4nm, 5nm |
| Geography | Hsinchu → Hsinchu |
| Risk | Taiwan concentration |

MediaTek is a major TSMC customer — benefits from geographic proximity.

---

## Competitive position

| vs | MediaTek advantage | MediaTek disadvantage |
|----|--------------------|-----------------------|
| [[Qualcomm]] | Cost, China presence | Modem, US premium |
| [[Broadcom]] | Lower margins, flexibility | Turnkey expertise |
| [[Marvell]] | ASIC design | Data center scale |

---

## China exposure

**Significant China revenue:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China revenue | ~40% |
| Key customers | Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo |
| Risk | Geopolitical tension |
| Benefit | Market access |

China exposure is both opportunity and risk.

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2454.TW (Taiwan) |
| Market cap | ~$50B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$15B |
| Gross margin | ~45% |
| R&D spend | ~25% of revenue |
| P/E | ~15x |

## US-Taiwan trade deal (Jan 2026)

**Beneficiary of [[US-Taiwan relations]] breakthrough:**

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tariffs | Cut to 15% on Taiwan goods |
| Investment framework | $500B Taiwan chip commitment |
| Sentiment | Reduced Taiwan risk premium |

MediaTek as Taiwan fabless company benefits from:
- Lower tariffs on chip exports to US
- Stronger US-Taiwan ties reduce geopolitical discount
- TSMC expansion = continued foundry access

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Hyperscaler ASIC wins (Google, Microsoft)
- Broadcom margin compression play
- Mobile share gains vs Qualcomm
- TSMC relationship
- **US-Taiwan trade deal** — reduced tariffs, stronger ties

**Bear case:**
- China geopolitical risk (~40% revenue)
- Qualcomm competition
- Taiwan concentration risk (mitigated by trade deal)
- Hyperscaler deals may not scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2454.TW |
| Market cap | ~$50B |
| Revenue | ~$15B |
| Mobile position | #2 globally |
| Key ASIC customer | Google (TPU) |
| Foundry | TSMC |
