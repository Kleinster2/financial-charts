## Investment thesis

**Diversified AI capex exposure:**

**Brian Kessens (Tortoise Capital):**
> "We're not gonna be right on all of them over time, but we're gonna be right on a good number of them."

On volatility (like Rubin chiller comment):
> "That might be an opportunity for us to say, well, hey, they're an even better buy now over the longer term."
