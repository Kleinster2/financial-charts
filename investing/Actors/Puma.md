# Puma

**Third-largest sportswear brand globally** (behind Nike and Adidas). €8.8B revenue (2024, +4.4% CC) — growth lagging peers. Stock at 9-year lows (-70% from 2021 peak). Former CEO Bjørn Gulden left for Adidas in 2023, creating a leadership vacuum. New CEO Arne Freundt struggling to differentiate. Kering still holds ~6% residual stake. Motorsport/football heritage, but lacks the cultural heat of Nike or Adidas.

## Financial performance

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue (€B) | 8.47 | 8.60 | 8.82 |
| Revenue growth (CC) | +18% | +7% | +4.4% |
| EBIT (€M) | 641 | 622 | ~620 |
| EBIT margin | 7.6% | 7.2% | ~7% |
| Net income (€M) | 353 | 305 | ~310 |

**Growth decelerating, margins flat.** Puma can't break out of the mid-single-digit growth / 7% margin band.

## The Gulden problem

Bjørn Gulden was Puma CEO 2013-2022, drove revenue from €3B to €8.5B, then **left for Adidas** in January 2023.

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Brand momentum | Lost — Adidas gained cultural heat |
| Stock reaction | Puma -70% from 2021 peak |
| New CEO challenge | Arne Freundt is an insider, less transformative |
| Adidas revival | Gulden's Samba/Gazelle strategy directly hurts Puma |

The irony: Puma's greatest CEO success was building a playbook he then executed for their direct competitor.

## Category breakdown

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Footwear** | ~45% of sales, Speedcat revival attempt |
| **Apparel** | ~35%, athleisure competition |
| **Accessories** | ~20% |

**Sports marketing:** Formula 1 (Ferrari, Mercedes), football (Man City, AC Milan, Neymar), golf, running. Strong in motorsport but lacks Nike's basketball/Jordan-level cultural assets.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Stock at 9-year low, ~10x PE — valuation floor
- €8.8B revenue base is not going away
- Speedcat/retro shoe cycle could provide momentum
- Nike's struggles create opportunity for #2/#3 brands
- Motorsport/F1 partnership growing culturally
- Kering stake overhang clearing (selling down)

**Bear:**
- No cultural momentum — lost to Adidas revival
- CEO vacuum — Freundt hasn't articulated differentiation
- Margins stuck at ~7% (peers at 10%+)
- Squeezed between Nike (scale) and new brands (On, Hoka)
- Football partnerships expensive, ROI unclear
- Growth deceleration (18% → 7% → 4%)
