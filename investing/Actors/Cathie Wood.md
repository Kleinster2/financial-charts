## Key theses & frameworks

### Disruptive innovation platforms
Identifies five "innovation platforms" converging simultaneously: [[AI]], [[robotics]], energy storage, [[genomics]], and [[blockchain]]. Argues these will drive GDP growth and create trillions in market value. Believes incumbents are too focused on short-term earnings to invest properly.

### Tesla robotaxi thesis
Most famous single-stock call. Predicted [[Tesla]] would reach $4,000+ (pre-split) driven by autonomous ride-hailing revenue. Published detailed Monte Carlo models with robotaxi revenue dominating. Maintained conviction through massive drawdowns.

### Wright's Law over Moore's Law
Argues costs decline as a function of cumulative production (Wright's Law), not just time. Applies this to [[batteries]], [[genomic sequencing]], and [[AI]] compute to project exponential adoption curves.

### Deflation thesis
Contrarian macro view: argues technology-driven [[deflation]] will overpower monetary inflation, meaning [[Federal Reserve]] will be forced to cut rates aggressively. Used this to justify holding long-duration growth stocks.

## Track record

### Hits ✅
- Tesla early call — Bought [[Tesla]] heavily before the 2020 rally. Stock went from ~$50 (split-adjusted) to $400+
- Bitcoin exposure — Added [[Bitcoin]] exposure early through [[Grayscale]] and [[Coinbase]]. ARK filed for spot Bitcoin ETF
- 2020 performance — ARKK up 153% in a year, one of best fund performances globally
- Genomics conviction — Early investor in [[CRISPR Therapeutics]], [[Exact Sciences]], [[Pacific Biosciences]] before [[genomics]] became mainstream
- Open research model — Pioneered transparency in active management; influenced industry

### Misses ❌
- 2021–22 drawdown — ARKK fell ~75% from peak. Morningstar: $7.1B in shareholder value destroyed over 10 years
- Tesla $4,000 PT — Even post-split, Tesla hasn't come close to the robotaxi-driven valuation
- Concentrated bets in illiquid names — Portfolio became its own whale: selling moved prices against her. Forced selling accelerated drawdown
- Timing of conviction — Bought more as stocks fell ("buy the dip") through entire 2022 downturn, amplifying losses
- Archegos connection — Initial seed capital came from [[Bill Hwang]], later convicted of fraud
