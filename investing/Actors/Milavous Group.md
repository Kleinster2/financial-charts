## Operations

### Products

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Oil & gas | Crude, refined products |
| Petrochemicals | Various |

### Methods

| Technique | Detail |
|-----------|--------|

| **Location** | Fujairah (UAE port) for blending |
| **Currency** | Yuan transactions (outside US sanctions) |

## Culture

Former employees describe "spy thriller" atmosphere:
- Employees use aliases, even with each other
- At Dec 2023 holiday party, Shamkhani introduced only as "H"
- High secrecy about beneficial ownership
- Sweeping views of Persian Gulf from 38th floor

## Challenges (2023-2024)

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Mid-2023 | Major customers delayed payments |
| Treasury pressure | Banks asking more questions |
| Early 2024 | Dozens of layoffs |
| Apr 2024 | US sanctions ~12 ships |

Despite setbacks, better positioned than rivals that collapsed under sanctions pressure — business connections allow continued operations.

## Legal status

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| UAE | Legal — UAE doesn't enforce Iran/Russia sanctions |
| US | Under FBI/Treasury investigation |
| Ships | 12+ sanctioned |
| Entity | Not sanctioned (as of Aug 2024) |

**Company statement:** Managing Director AlHashmi says Bloomberg claims are "factually wrong, untrue, and legally incorrect." Denies links to Russian or Iranian interests.

## Why it matters

1. **Scale:** ~$15B turnover (2022), one of Iran's top 3
2. **Sanctions evasion:** Template for circumventing restrictions
3. **Iran-Russia nexus:** Handles both countries' crude
4. **Regime funding:** Contributes to Iran's ~$35B/year oil revenue
5. **Enforcement challenge:** If sanctioned, "would disrupt whole oil market"
6. **Whac-A-Mole:** New entities replace sanctioned ones
