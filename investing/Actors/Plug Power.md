**Plug Power** — Hydrogen fuel cell company. Material handling (forklifts), green hydrogen production. Struggling financially despite big vision.

---

## Why Plug Power matters

Plug is the largest pure-play hydrogen company:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Focus | Green hydrogen ecosystem |
| Products | Fuel cells, electrolyzers, hydrogen production |
| Customers | [[Amazon]], [[Walmart]] (forklifts) |
| Challenge | Cash burn, going concern risk |

---

## Business model

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fuel cells | Material handling (forklifts), stationary |
| Electrolyzers | Produce green hydrogen |
| Hydrogen production | Green hydrogen plants |
| Infrastructure | Fueling, storage, distribution |

**Vertical integration:** Trying to own entire hydrogen value chain.

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| [[Amazon]] | Forklift fuel cells |
| [[Walmart]] | Distribution center forklifts |
| Various | Material handling |

**Moat:** Locked in major retailers for warehouse hydrogen.

## Green hydrogen vision

**The pitch:**
- Electrolyze water using renewable electricity
- Zero-carbon hydrogen
- Replace fossil fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors
- Data centers? (some pilots)

**Reality:** Very expensive vs gray hydrogen (natural gas).

---

## AI/Data center relevance

**Potential but unproven:**
- Fuel cells for backup power (vs diesel)
- Green hydrogen for data center power
- Most data centers not using hydrogen yet
- [[Bloom Energy]] fuel cells more established

---

## Financial struggles

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Going concern warning | 2023 audit flag |
| Cash burn | Significant |
| Revenue growth | Slower than expected |
| Green hydrogen economics | Challenging |
| Stock | Down 90%+ from peak |

**Risk:** Needs capital markets or will struggle.

---

## Investment case

**Bull (speculative):**
- Pure-play green hydrogen
- IRA hydrogen tax credits ($3/kg)
- [[Amazon]]/[[Walmart]] relationships
- First mover in ecosystem
- DOE support

**Bear:**
- Going concern risk
- Cash burn unsustainable
- Green hydrogen economics don't work
- Competition from incumbents
- Execution failures

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | PLUG (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$2B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$700M |
| Net income | Large losses |
| Cash burn | Significant |
| Going concern | Flagged by auditors |

**Distressed:** Speculative at current state.
