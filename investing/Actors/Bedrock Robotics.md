Bedrock Robotics — autonomous construction equipment. Retrofits existing excavators/bulldozers with AI. Founded 2024 by ex-[[Waymo]] engineers.

---

## Why Bedrock matters

Applying autonomous vehicle tech stack to construction — a sector with ~800K worker shortfall and 8-month project backlogs. Rather than building new machines, Bedrock retrofits existing fleets with reversible hardware/software installs.

## Technology — Bedrock Operator

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Approach | Retrofit kit, same-day install, reversible |
| Sensors | LiDAR, GPS, IMUs, 8x HD cameras |
| Compute | In-cab onboard computer |
| Capabilities | Perception, planning, control, safety |
| Target equipment | Excavators, bulldozers, loaders |

Not building new machines — upgrading existing fleets. Lower capex barrier for contractors.
