**Greenland** — World's largest island, autonomous territory of Denmark. Strategic Arctic position, rare earth deposits, and US military presence make it geopolitically significant.

---

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Status | Autonomous territory of [[Denmark]] |
| Population | ~57,000 |
| Capital | Nuuk |
| Area | 2.17M sq km (836K sq mi) |
| Ice-free land | ~20% |
| Economy | Fishing, subsidies from Denmark |

---

## Strategic value

### Location
- Controls access to [[Northwest Passage]]
- Gateway between Atlantic and Arctic
- Shortest route for polar flights / missiles between US and [[Russia]]

### US military presence

| Facility | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Pituffik [[Space]] Base** (formerly Thule) | Early warning radar, missile defense, satellite tracking |
| Historical | Cold War strategic bomber base |

Pituffik is northernmost US military installation — critical for Arctic domain awareness and missile warning.

### Key locations (from IISS map)
- **Pituffik** — US [[Space]] Force base, northwest coast
- **Nuuk** — Capital, southwest coast
- **Kangerlussuaq** — Main civilian airport
- **Mestersvig** — Eastern coast

## Resources

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Rare earths** | Kvanefjeld deposit — one of world's largest (uranium/rare earths) |
| [[Oil]]/gas | Exploration paused (2021 ban) |
| Minerals | Zinc, iron ore, rubies |
| Fisheries | Primary current export |

**Rare earth significance:** Potential to reduce Western dependence on [[China]]. But development faces environmental opposition and infrastructure challenges.

## Political status

### Denmark relationship
- Foreign affairs and defense controlled by Copenhagen
- Greenland has self-rule on most domestic matters
- Annual block grant from Denmark (~$600M)
- Independence movement exists but lacks economic viability

### US interest — 150+ year history

US has sought control of Greenland repeatedly since 1867:

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1867 | Secretary of State William Seward (after Alaska purchase from [[Russia]]) made formal proposal, commissioned study |
| 1940 | US sent Coast Guard "volunteers" when Nazis invaded Denmark |
| 1941-45 | Established strategic bases during WWII |
| Post-1945 | Dramatically expanded bases with Danish authorization during Cold War |
| 1991 | Presence reduced after Soviet collapse |
| 2019 | Trump floated purchase idea (first term) — Denmark rejected as "absurd" |
| 2025 | Trump renewed annexation push in second term |
| Jan 2026 | Threatened tariffs on countries opposing annexation |

**Consistent rationale across 150 years:**
- Strategic Arctic location
- Access to natural resources / minerals
- Geopolitical conflict context (Civil War aftermath → WWII → Cold War → [[China]] competition)

**Why US wants closer ties today:**
- Arctic defense ([[Russia]], [[China]] presence)
- Rare earth access
- Climate change opening region
- Counter Chinese investment attempts

**[[China]] attempts:** Has sought mining investments, research presence. Denmark/Greenland have pushed back on security grounds.

## Independence question

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Economic viability | Low — depends on Danish subsidies |
| Resource potential | Could change calculus if developed |
| Population sentiment | Mixed — growing autonomy desire |
| Danish position | Would allow if Greenlanders vote for it |
| Timeline | Not imminent |

## Investment lens

**Not directly investable** — no stock market, limited private sector.

**Relevant as:**
- Rare earth supply chain geopolitics
- Arctic shipping route development
- US-[[China]] competition proxy
- Climate change bellwether

**Watch for:**
- Rare earth mining approvals
- US investment/aid packages
- Independence referendum discussions
- Chinese investment attempts
