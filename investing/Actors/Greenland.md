**Greenland** — World's largest island, autonomous territory of Denmark. Strategic Arctic position, rare earth deposits, and US military presence make it geopolitically significant.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Status | Autonomous territory of [[Denmark]] |
| Population | ~57,000 |
| Capital | Nuuk |
| Area | 2.17M sq km (836K sq mi) |
| Ice-free land | ~20% |
| Economy | Fishing, subsidies from Denmark |

## Strategic value

### Location
- Controls access to [[Northwest Passage]]
- Gateway between Atlantic and Arctic
- Shortest route for polar flights / missiles between US and Russia

### US military presence

| Facility | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Pituffik Space Base** (formerly Thule) | Early warning radar, missile defense, satellite tracking |
| Historical | Cold War strategic bomber base |

Pituffik is northernmost US military installation — critical for Arctic domain awareness and missile warning.

### Key locations (from IISS map)
- **Pituffik** — US Space Force base, northwest coast
- **Nuuk** — Capital, southwest coast
- **Kangerlussuaq** — Main civilian airport
- **Mestersvig** — Eastern coast

## Resources

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Rare earths** | Kvanefjeld deposit — one of world's largest (uranium/rare earths) |
| Oil/gas | Exploration paused (2021 ban) |
| Minerals | Zinc, iron ore, rubies |
| Fisheries | Primary current export |

**Rare earth significance:** Potential to reduce Western dependence on China. But development faces environmental opposition and infrastructure challenges.

## Political status

### Denmark relationship
- Foreign affairs and defense controlled by Copenhagen
- Greenland has self-rule on most domestic matters
- Annual block grant from Denmark (~$600M)
- Independence movement exists but lacks economic viability

### US interest

**Trump administration (2019):** Floated idea of purchasing Greenland — Denmark rejected as "absurd."

**Why US wants closer ties:**
- Arctic defense (Russia, China presence)
- Rare earth access
- Climate change opening region
- Counter Chinese investment attempts

**China attempts:** Has sought mining investments, research presence. Denmark/Greenland have pushed back on security grounds.

## Independence question

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Economic viability | Low — depends on Danish subsidies |
| Resource potential | Could change calculus if developed |
| Population sentiment | Mixed — growing autonomy desire |
| Danish position | Would allow if Greenlanders vote for it |
| Timeline | Not imminent |

## Investment lens

**Not directly investable** — no stock market, limited private sector.

**Relevant as:**
- Rare earth supply chain geopolitics
- Arctic shipping route development
- US-China competition proxy
- Climate change bellwether

**Watch for:**
- Rare earth mining approvals
- US investment/aid packages
- Independence referendum discussions
- Chinese investment attempts
