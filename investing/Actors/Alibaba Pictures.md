## Key films

### Scare Out (惊蛰无声, 2026)

Directed by [[Zhang Yimou]]. Counter-espionage thriller — the **first feature film guided by China's Ministry of State Security**. A national security team hunts a spy after a critical intelligence leak. Cast: Jackson Yee (易烊千玺), Zhu Yilong, Song Jia, Lei Jiayin, Yang Mi, Zhang Yi. Released Chinese New Year 2026 (Feb 17) in China and internationally via CMC Pictures. Produced by Alibaba Pictures Group.

Part of the "propaganda-meets-blockbuster" model — state agencies collaborating with top directors for patriotic content, following [[The Battle at Lake Changjin]] (PLA-backed) and Wolf Warrior series.

### Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force (封神第二部, 2025)

Fantasy epic, Alibaba Pictures as producer. Earned **$137.2M** during 2025 Lunar New Year window alone. Third-highest grosser of the Spring Festival period.

### Other recent productions

- **The Last Dance** (2024) — production
- **Maharaja** (2024) — distribution (Indian film for Chinese market)
- **Full River Red** (满江红, 2023) — Zhang Yimou, highest-grossing film of 2023 Spring Festival
- Upcoming slate (announced Shanghai 2024): tentpoles from Feng Xiaogang, Xu Zheng, Guan Hu; sci-fi epic "The Decisive Moment" directed by Zhang Disha

## Leadership

| Role | Name | Since |
|------|------|-------|
| **Chairman & CEO** | Fan Luyuan (樊路远) | Aug 2017 |
| **CEO, Digital Media & Entertainment Group** | Fan Luyuan | Mar 2023 (restructuring) |
| **President, Damai** | Fan Luyuan | May 2018 |

Fan joined [[Alibaba]] in 2007 and rose through Alipay and mobile payments before taking over Alibaba Pictures. He consolidated control across entertainment, becoming the single most powerful executive in Alibaba's content strategy.

## Investment considerations

- **Platform moat**: Tao Piaopiao + Damai give Alibaba Pictures unmatched data on Chinese consumer entertainment preferences, feeding both distribution decisions and IP development
- **Alibaba ecosystem integration**: ticketing embedded in Alipay/Taobao drives user acquisition at near-zero marginal cost
- **State content alignment**: growing role producing state-endorsed content (MSS, PLA collaborations) provides regulatory favor but limits creative independence
- **Streaming losses**: Youku remains a distant #3 behind [[Tencent Video]] and [[iQiyi]], requiring ongoing subsidies
- **Valuation**: at ~US$3.3B market cap on ~$1B revenue, trades at ~3x revenue — discount to global entertainment peers reflects China regulatory risk and Alibaba parent overhang
