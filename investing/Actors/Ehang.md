## Investment lens

**Ticker:** EH (NASDAQ)

**Bull case:**
- First certified passenger eVTOL
- Actually delivering/generating revenue
- Autonomous = no pilot cost
- China tourism market

**Bear case:**
- Small scale
- China-focused (limited Western certification)
- NASDAQ listing = China regulatory risk
- Short-range limits utility

**vs US peers:** Ehang has certification and revenue; Joby/Archer still pre-revenue. But Ehang's market is China-focused.
