## Why Robinhood matters

Robinhood is the gateway for retail into new asset classes:

| Innovation | Impact |
|------------|--------|

| Mobile-first UX | Made trading accessible |
| Fractional shares | Lowered barriers |
| Crypto trading | Mainstream adoption |
| Tokenized private shares | OpenAI/SpaceX exposure |

## Tokenized private shares (June 2025)

**Most ambitious crypto push yet:**
- Launched tokenized OpenAI, SpaceX shares in Europe
- Retail can now get "exposure" to private companies
- Not actual equity — derivative instruments
- OpenAI publicly did not endorse the move

**Why it matters:**
- First major brokerage to offer private company tokens
- Tests regulatory boundaries
- Could open floodgates if successful
