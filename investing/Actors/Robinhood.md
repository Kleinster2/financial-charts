Robinhood — Retail brokerage that democratized trading. Now pushing into crypto and tokenized private shares. First to offer OpenAI/[[SpaceX]] tokens to retail.

---

## Why Robinhood matters

Robinhood is the gateway for retail into new asset classes:

| Innovation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Commission-free trading | Forced industry to follow |
| Mobile-first UX | Made trading accessible |
| Fractional shares | Lowered barriers |
| Crypto trading | Mainstream adoption |
| Tokenized private shares | OpenAI/[[SpaceX]] exposure |

---

## Tokenized private shares (June 2025)

Most ambitious crypto push yet:
- Launched tokenized OpenAI, [[SpaceX]] shares in [[Europe]]
- Retail can now get "exposure" to private companies
- Not actual equity — derivative instruments
- OpenAI publicly did not endorse the move

Why it matters:
- First major brokerage to offer private company tokens
- Tests regulatory boundaries
- Could open floodgates if successful

See [[Tokenized private shares]] for full analysis.

## Meme stock legacy (5-year retrospective, Jan 2026)

90% of the 2.5M accounts added in January 2021 are still on the platform (Robinhood disclosure, Jan 2026).

Those users have matured: many now use retirement accounts, high-yield savings, and less speculative products. "They were 20-something-year-olds. Now, maybe they're in their 30s" — Steve Quirk, Chief Brokerage Officer.

Robinhood is in an arms race with [[Interactive Brokers]] and [[Charles Schwab]] to serve an increasingly sophisticated retail base.
