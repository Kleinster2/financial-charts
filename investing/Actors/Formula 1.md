Formula 1 — Premier open-wheel auto racing series, owned by [[Liberty Media]] (tracking stock FWONA/FWONK). 24 races across 5 continents. ~$3.65B revenue in 2024, growing at ~14% annually. The most valuable global sports property outside top-tier football leagues, transformed from a European niche into a US-friendly media franchise under Liberty's ownership since 2017.

## Business model

Four revenue streams, all growing under Liberty ownership. Revenue up 91% from 2017–2024.

| Stream | 2024 ~% | ~Amount | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Media rights | 33% | $1.18B | [[Sky Sports]], [[ESPN]], F1 TV direct |
| Race promotion | 29% | $1.07B | Hosting fees from cities/governments |
| Sponsorship | 19% | $680M | [[LVMH]], [[DHL]], [[Crypto.com]] |
| Other | 19% | $710M | Hospitality, licensing, F1 Experiences |

Revenue is shared with teams under the Concorde Agreement — roughly 45–50% of profits flow to teams. 2024 team payments totaled $1.27B.

## Financials

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Adj. OIBDA ($M) | Op. Income ($M) | Team Payments ($M) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 2017 | 1.91 | — | — | — |
| 2022 | 2.57 | 584 | — | — |
| 2023 | 3.22 | 725 | — | 1,215 |
| 2024 | 3.65 | 791 | 492 | 1,266 |
| 2025E | ~4.3 | ~1,041 | — | — |

2025 tracking well ahead of prior year — Q2 revenue $1.34B (+14% YoY), OIBDA $369M (+21%). TTM revenue ~$4.0B as of Jan 2026.

---

## Media rights

The fastest-growing revenue line. US media rights nearly valueless in 2017 — [[NBC]] declined to renew its $4M/year deal — now worth $160M/year.

| Market        | Partner        | Term         | Value                    |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| US            | [[ESPN]]       | 2023–2025    | ~$75–90M/year            |
| US            | [[Apple TV]]   | 2026–2030    | ~$160M/year              |
| UK            | [[Sky Sports]] | Through 2029 | ~GBP 1B total            |
| Germany/Italy | Sky            | Through 2027 | —                        |
| Direct        | F1 TV          | Ongoing      | Subscribers +15% in 2024 |

The [[Apple|Apple TV]] deal (announced Oct 2025) is the key inflection — nearly 2x ESPN's price, validating F1's US growth story. Risk: streaming has smaller installed base than cable.

---

## Growth drivers

US expansion is the thesis. Three US races (Austin, Miami, Las Vegas), viewership doubling since 2018, and the [[Netflix]] "Drive to Survive" effect.

| Metric | 2018 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| US avg. viewers (ESPN) | 554K | 1.1M | +99% |
| Global fans | — | 826.5M | +12% YoY |
| Attendance | — | 6.5M | +9% YoY |
| Social media followers | 18.7M | 107.6M | +475% |

Drive to Survive effect: 53% of fans credit the show for becoming fans. Average F1 TV viewer age dropped from 44 to 32. 37% of new fans from the US.

Las Vegas GP: Liberty invested $500M in infrastructure. 2024 economic impact $934M. Sellout in 2025, viewership up 70% YoY. But Liberty acknowledged the event "missed internal expectations on revenue and OIBDA" — sunk cost risk.

F1 film (2025): Brad Pitt vehicle produced by [[Apple]]. ~$630M global box office — most successful sports film in history.

---

## Sponsorship ecosystem

Sponsorship has become a premium global advertising channel. F1-level deals plus team-level deals combined for record revenue.

| Deal | Partner | Terms |
|------|---------|-------|
| Title | [[LVMH]] | 10-year, ~$150M/year ($1.5B total). Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Moet Hennessy |
| Logistics | [[DHL]] | Extended, ~$40M/year |
| Crypto | [[Crypto.com]] | Extended through 2030, ~$20M/year |
| Technology | [[Lenovo]] | Multi-year |
| Banking | [[Santander]], [[American Express]] | Multi-year |

Teams collectively generated $2.04B in sponsorship revenue in 2024 — separate from F1's own $680M.

---

## Team economics

10 teams compete under cost cap ($135M base + ~$1.8M per race above 21, effective ~$150–160M with inflation). Revenue distributed via the Concorde Agreement (2021–2025; 2026–2030 terms not fully disclosed).

Team valuations (2024, Sportico):

| Team | Value ($B) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| [[Ferrari]] | 4.78 | Historical bonus (5–10% of prize pool) |
| [[Mercedes]] | 3.94 | |
| [[Red Bull]] | 3.50 | |
| [[McLaren]] | — | 2024 constructors champion, $161M prize |
| Average | 2.31 | +44% YoY |
| Floor (Haas) | 1.02 | Every team now $1B+ |

Total grid value ~$23B. Liberty's own enterprise value ~$22B — 175% above 2017 purchase price.

---

## MotoGP acquisition

Completed July 2025. Enterprise value EUR 4.2B (~$5.0B). Liberty took 84% stake, Dorna management retained 16%. Financed partly with $1B term loan from F1. Now housed under the Formula One Group tracking stocks (FWONA/FWONK), making the tracker a motorsport portfolio rather than pure F1.

---

## 11th team: Cadillac/GM (2026)

[[FIA]] approved March 2025. [[General Motors|GM]]/[[Cadillac]] entry as first new independent constructor since Haas (2016). $450M anti-dilution fee paid to existing teams (vs $200M in 2020 Concorde Agreement — reflects F1's commercial growth). [[Ferrari]] power units 2026–2028; GM building own engine for 2029.

---

## Liberty Media restructuring

Post-2024 split-offs (SiriusXM Sept 2024, Liberty Live Dec 2025), the FWONA/FWONK tracking stocks are now a cleaner play: F1 + [[MotoGP]] + minority investments. Less conglomerate discount, more sports media pure-play.

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Calendar fatigue | Drivers publicly oppose 24-race calendar; Concorde caps at 25 |
| Apple TV transition | 2026 US rights move from cable (ESPN) to streaming — viewership fragmentation risk |
| Geopolitical | Races in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, China carry reputational risk |
| Las Vegas economics | $500M sunk cost; Liberty acknowledged underperformance vs internal targets |
| Cost cap enforcement | Complex across global teams; Red Bull fined $7M for 2021 overspend |
| 2026 regulation change | New engine rules + active aero could disrupt competitive balance |
| Team revenue dilution | 11th team splits prize pool further unless total revenue grows proportionally |
| MotoGP integration | $5B acquisition adds execution risk and leverage |
