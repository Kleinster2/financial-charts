#actor #reference #fixed-income

Complete inventory of [[Microsoft]] outstanding bonds. All bonds are senior unsecured. Microsoft is **deleveraging** — no new cash bond issuance since 2017. Every subsequent "issuance" has been an exchange offer or assumption of [[Activision Blizzard]] debt.

Other credit facilities: commercial paper program ($0 outstanding as of Dec 2025; was $6.7B at Jun 2024); revolving credit facility (historically $1.3-2B, never drawn).

## Credit rating

| Agency | Rating | Outlook |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Moody's | **Aaa** | Stable |
| S&P | **AAA** | Stable |

One of only two AAA/Aaa-rated U.S. corporates (with [[Apple]] at Aaa/AA+). After Moody's downgraded U.S. Treasuries from Aaa to Aa1 in May 2025, Microsoft holds a **higher credit rating than the U.S. government** at Moody's.

## Face value outstanding (as of Feb 2026)

| Currency | Face outstanding |
|----------|-----------------|
| USD | ~$43.5B |
| EUR | ~$2.7B (EUR bonds at current FX) |
| **Total** | **$46.2B** (Dec 31, 2025) |

Carrying value $40.3B (reflects $4.8B premium-on-exchange contra-debt item from 2020/2021 exchange offers). Down from $49.2B (Jun 2025) and $51.2B (Jun 2024).

## Maturity schedule

| Fiscal Year (ending Jun 30) | Face maturing |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| FY2027 | $9.25B (largest near-term wall) |
| FY2028 | $0 |
| FY2029 | $2.1B (EUR bonds) |
| FY2030 | $0 |
| FY2031+ | $34.9B (75% of total) |
| **Total** | **$46.2B** |

75% of outstanding debt matures after 2031 — deliberate strategy of locking in low rates on ultra-long paper.

## Key financial context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cash paid for interest (FY2025) | $1.6B |
| Operating cash flow (FY2025) | $136.2B |
| Interest coverage ratio | **~80x** |
| Cash + short-term investments | ~$90-102B |
| Net debt | ~$34B |

Microsoft's debt is a rounding error relative to its cash generation. The entire bond program exists because exchanging short-dated paper for ultra-long-dated bonds at 2-3% during 2020-2021 was extraordinarily value-accretive.
