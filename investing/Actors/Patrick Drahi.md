# Patrick Drahi

French-Israeli-Portuguese billionaire (b. 1963) who built [[Altice]] into a $60B+ telecom empire through leveraged acquisitions. Now fighting to retain control as debt restructurings hand equity to creditors.

## Background

Born in Casablanca, Morocco to French math teachers. Moved to Montpellier at 15. Engineering degrees from École Polytechnique and Télécom Paris (1986). Founded Altice in Amsterdam (2001) and began rolling up European cable assets.

Acquired Portuguese citizenship in 2015 through Sephardic Jewish heritage (descended from families expelled in 1496). Lives in Geneva with wife Lina since 1999.

## Empire Building

**France**: Built Numericable cable network, then acquired SFR from Vivendi (2014) for ~$24B enterprise value, creating France's #2 telecom.

**US**: Bought 70% of Suddenlink (2015), then Cablevision from the Dolan family, forming Altice USA (now Optimum Communications).

**Israel**: Owns HOT cable and founded i24news (2013), broadcasting in French, Arabic, and English.

**Portugal**: Altice Portugal became a major asset, now at center of creditor disputes.

**UK**: Built 24.5% stake in BT Group (2021-2023), making him largest shareholder.

**Auction House**: Acquired [[Sotheby's]] for $3.7B (2019).

## The Unwind

Net worth peaked at $26.5B (2015, Forbes #56 globally, Israel's richest). By Sep 2025: ~$8B (#415) as highly leveraged structure collapsed amid rising rates and cord-cutting.

Drahi has executed three major creditor-hostile maneuvers in two years, moving assets out of collateral pools and suing lenders. Maintains control through voting shares despite shrinking economic stake.
