## Depop sale to eBay (Feb 19, 2026)

Sold [[Depop]] to [[eBay]] for **$1.2B cash** — a ~$400M loss vs. the $1.625B acquisition price in 2021. Deal expected to close Q2 2026. Shares surged ~18-20% on the news as investors welcomed the simplification + cash infusion despite the write-down.

Announced alongside weak Q4 earnings — revenue missed, demand pressures persist. But the Depop divestiture overshadowed the miss.

## Portfolio (post-Depop)

| Brand | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Etsy** | Handmade, vintage | Core |
| **Reverb** | Musical instruments | Sold Apr 2025 |
| ~~Depop~~ | ~~Gen Z fashion resale~~ | Sold to [[eBay]] Feb 2026 ($1.2B) |
| **Elo7** | [[Brazil]] crafts | Active |

Etsy is now back to a single-brand company after shedding Reverb and Depop — the 2021 portfolio expansion strategy is fully unwound.
