## Tanbreez project

Located in southern Greenland, Tanbreez is notable for:

**Exceptional HREE content:**
- Yttrium: 45% of restricted global supply
- Terbium: 45%
- Dysprosium: 62%
- Gadolinium: 35%
- Lutetium: 80%
- Samarium: 19%

**Additional critical minerals:**
- Zirconium (Zr) — critical for hypersonic weapons
- Niobium (Nb)
- Tantalum (Ta)
- Hafnium (Hf)
- Gallium (Ga)

## Operations concept

Simple mining and logistics model:
- **Open pit mine** with onsite dry magnetic separation
- **Floating dock** to load ore directly onto ships
- Located alongside 200-foot-deep fjord (large carriers can operate)
- **Ice-free year-round** — direct shipping to North America/Europe
- No choke point transit required

Three ore components:
1. Feldspar — sold for construction materials
2. Arfvedsonite — sold for construction materials
3. Eudialyte — contains HREE at 0.4% total REO with 27% HREE concentration

The construction materials revenue makes the mine profitable before HREE extraction.

## Sustainability

Using hydroelectric power, Tanbreez is expected to be one of the greenest mining operations globally.
