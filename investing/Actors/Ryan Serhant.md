## Investment philosophy

**"Stretch yourself"** — Intentionally buys above his means to create pressure to earn more. From Iced Coffee Hour interview (Jan 2026):

| Property | Price | Context |
|----------|-------|---------|
| First condo | $3.7M | Budget was $1.5M; "terrifying" |
| First house | $7.6M | Gut renovated |

Advises this approach only for salespeople with variable income — not W2 workers with fixed salaries.

## NYC luxury market insights (Jan 2026)

From Iced Coffee Hour interview:

**Foreign buyer myth:**
- "Categorically false" that foreigners are driving prices today
- Was true during Obama years (2008-2016) when dollar was cheap
- Post-Obama: dollar strengthened → foreigners sold (20-50% currency gains)
- NYC residential: 70% rental, 30% for-sale; most for-sale is primary residence

**"They're broke" thesis:**
- Even $3-5M condo buyers live paycheck to paycheck
- New mentality: "I'll just make more money" — across all price points
- Buyers with $700K down often have no reserves after closing
- Quality of life expectations prevent living below means

**What drives costs:**
1. Lack of inventory
2. Lack of incentive to build (regulatory burden)
3. High rates increasing cost of ownership

## Wealth creation observation

On post-2020 market:
- $100M+ residential trades now common
- Secondary homes at $75-95M price point
- "The amount of wealth creation that's happened over the past 5 years... is completely insane"
