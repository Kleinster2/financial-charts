# Base44

AI app builder — vibe coding for non-programmers. Type what you want in natural language, get a working app with database, auth, storage, and deployment handled automatically. Founded late 2024 as a side project by solo founder Maor Shlomo, bootstrapped to 250K users and $1M ARR in 3 weeks, acquired by [[Wix]] for ~$80M in June 2025. Six employees, zero external funding. Poster child for the AI-enabled micro-team thesis.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | [[Israel]] |
| Founded | Late 2024 (as side project) |
| Founder | Maor Shlomo (solo, 31 years old) |
| Employees at acquisition | 6-8 |
| Funding | Zero (bootstrapped) |
| Acquired | June 2025 by [[Wix]], ~$80M cash + earn-out through 2029 |

## Growth metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | 250K in 6 months |
| Time to $1M ARR | ~3 weeks post-launch |
| May 2025 profit | $189K (after LLM token costs) |
| B2B clients | eToro, SimilarWeb |

Profitable from early on despite high LLM inference costs — a signal that vibe coding products can have real unit economics, not just growth-at-all-costs.

## How it works

Chat-based interface that generates complete applications from natural language prompts. Unlike code-generation tools that output code the user must then deploy, Base44 handles the full stack:

| Layer | Automated |
|-------|-----------|
| Database | Yes — schema generated from prompt |
| Authentication | Yes — user management included |
| Storage | Yes — file handling built in |
| Analytics | Yes — usage tracking |
| Deployment | Yes — live app, no DevOps needed |
| Integrations | Yes — no third-party setup required |

## Founder

Maor Shlomo, 31. Previously founded Explorium, an [[Insight Partners]]-backed data analytics company. Built Base44 as a side project while advising a nonprofit during the post-Oct 7 war period. Solo founder with self-described severe ADHD. Shared the entire journey publicly on LinkedIn and X.

## Super Bowl LX ad (Feb 8, 2026)

[[Wix]] bought a double feature at Super Bowl LX — one spot for Base44, one for Wix Harmony. Base44's ad ("It's App to You," directed by Tal Rosenthal and Noam Sharon, created in-house) showed office workers discovering they could build apps with natural language and spawning increasingly ambitious (and absurd) creations.

Notable context: 7 AI platform ads ran during this Super Bowl vs 6 combined beer and auto ads — a milestone for the category. [[Wix]]'s return to the Super Bowl after a 7-year hiatus (previously 2015-2019) signals the company is repositioning around AI, not just traditional web building.

## Acquisition by Wix (June 2025)

[[Wix]] acquired Base44 for ~$80M cash plus earn-out payments through 2029. Base44 continues operating as a distinct product. The deal gives Wix a vibe coding product for app creation alongside its core website builder — extending from "build a website" to "build anything."

The acquisition math: $80M for a 6-person, 6-month-old, bootstrapped startup generating ~$189K/month profit. That's roughly 35x annualized revenue — a premium that prices in the vibe coding category, not Base44's current revenue.

## What it signals

Base44 is a data point for several converging trends:

- AI compression of startup timelines — side project to $80M exit in ~6 months
- Solo/micro-team viability — LLMs as force multipliers let 1 person build what previously required 20
- Vibe coding as a category — non-programmers building real apps, not just prototypes
- Bootstrapping resurgence — zero VC, full founder ownership, clean cap table
- Israeli tech density — founder ecosystem (Explorium → Base44 → Wix) all within the same network
