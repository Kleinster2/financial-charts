# Levi Strauss

American denim company, founded 1853. Publicly traded (NYSE: LEVI). Revenue $6.35B (FY24), pivoting to DTC-first strategy under CEO Michelle Gass. Sold [[Dockers]] for $195M (Jul 2025) to focus on the Levi's brand and [[Beyond Yoga]]. DTC now ~46% of revenue and growing. The company that [[Athleisure]] nearly broke — forced to add stretch denim in 2014 when US teenagers chose yoga pants over jeans — has repositioned as a "head-to-toe denim lifestyle" brand.

## Athleisure disruption and response

Levi's was a casualty of the [[Athleisure]] wave — by 2014, US teenagers preferred yoga pants to jeans. The company responded with stretch denim (adding Lycra) and eventually acquired [[Beyond Yoga]] in 2021 to participate directly in the category. The pivot to "denim lifestyle" (jackets, accessories, non-pant categories) is partly a response to denim's shrinking share of the casualwear market.
