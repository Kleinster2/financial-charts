## Athleisure disruption and response

Levi's was a casualty of the [[Athleisure]] wave — by 2014, US teenagers preferred yoga pants to jeans. The company responded with stretch denim (adding Lycra) and eventually acquired [[Beyond Yoga]] in 2021 to participate directly in the category. The pivot to "denim lifestyle" (jackets, accessories, non-pant categories) is partly a response to denim's shrinking share of the casualwear market.
