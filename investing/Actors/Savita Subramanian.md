## Career Arc

Savita Subramanian started her career as an analyst at Scudder Kemper Investments (now part of [[DWS Group]]) in New York and San Francisco, working in asset management before pivoting to sell-side research. She joined [[Merrill Lynch]] in 2001 as a strategist — right at the start of the [[dot-com bust]].

She rose through the ranks at Merrill/BofA through the [[2008 financial crisis|GFC]] and its aftermath, eventually becoming Head of US Equity & Quantitative Strategy at [[Bank of America|BofA Global Research]]. She later added Head of ESG Research to her responsibilities, making her one of the most senior strategists on [[Wall Street]].

Subramanian is one of the most respected and widely followed equity strategists, known for rigorous quantitative frameworks rather than headline-grabbing hot takes. She's regularly featured on [[CNBC]], [[Bloomberg]], and in [[Barron's]].

## Key Theses & Frameworks

### Sell-Side Indicator
Her signature contrarian gauge tracks Wall Street strategists' average recommended equity allocation. When consensus is bearish (low allocation), it's historically bullish for stocks, and vice versa. This indicator called the post-2009 bull market well and has been one of BofA's most cited tools.

### Equity Risk Premium Framework
Subramanian's team closely tracks the [[equity risk premium]] — the excess return stocks offer over bonds. She uses this to assess whether equities are attractively priced relative to fixed income, and it drives her asset allocation calls.

### Sector Rotation & Factor Analysis
Her quantitative team produces detailed sector and factor models. She emphasizes earnings quality, capital discipline, and valuation dispersion as drivers of sector allocation. In recent years, she's advocated for a shift toward [[value stocks]] and capital-light business models.

### "Lost Decade" for Index Returns
Subramanian has warned that the [[S&P 500]] could face muted index-level returns over the next decade due to elevated valuations and concentration, while active stock-picking and equal-weight strategies could outperform.

## Track Record

### Hits ✅
- S&P 500 target of 4,600 for 2023 — close to actual year-end (~4,770), one of the better calls that year
- Bullish call for 2024 (5,000 target) — nailed direction, S&P blew past that level
- Sell-side indicator has been a strong long-term contrarian signal
- Early ESG integration on the sell side — ahead of the curve on institutional demand
- Quality factor emphasis — outperformed during volatile periods

### Misses ❌
- Cautious 2022 positioning — while directionally right on the bear market, some sector tilts underperformed
- Value over growth call has been frustratingly early — growth/mega-cap tech kept outperforming for years
- 2026 target of 7,100 — among the most bearish on the Street, seen as potentially too cautious if [[AI]] spending sustains
- ESG thesis has faced political headwinds and institutional pushback since 2023
