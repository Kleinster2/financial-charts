**Dongjin Semichem** — Korea's leading photoresist supplier. First Korean company to produce photoresist (4th globally). Critical supplier to [[Samsung]] and [[SK Hynix]].

---

## Why Dongjin Semichem matters

Korea's domestic photoresist champion, reducing reliance on [[Japan]]:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 005290.KS (Korea) |
| Market cap | ~$1.2B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$1B |
| Photoresist exports (2022-24) | $186M |
| Position | \#1 Korea, top 7 global |

---

## Strategic importance

**2019 [[Japan]]-Korea dispute:** [[Japan]] restricted photoresist exports to Korea over wartime labor disputes. Exposed Korea's vulnerability — Samsung and SK Hynix dependent on Japanese suppliers.

**Dongjin's role:** Domestic alternative, reducing [[Japan]] dependence.

## Product portfolio

| Product | Position | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **KrF photoresist** | Strong | 3D NAND focus, 80% global share (with JSR, TOK) |
| **ArF photoresist** | Growing | Immersion lithography |
| **V-NAND thick PR** | World-class | 2025 government recognition |
| **Display materials** | Significant | LCD/OLED |

## 3D NAND KrF photoresist

Dongjin is particularly strong in KrF photoresists for 3D NAND memory:

| Company | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Dongjin Semichem | Top 3 |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | Top 3 |
| [[JSR Corporation]] | Top 3 |

**Combined 80% share** of 3D NAND KrF photoresist market.

## Customers

- [[Samsung]] — memory and foundry
- [[SK Hynix]] — memory
- Other Korean fabs

**Domestic focus:** Korea's fab expansion = Dongjin growth.

---

## Capacity expansion

- **+30% capacity since 2022** to meet domestic demand
- Targeting further expansion as Korean fabs grow

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Korea photoresist independence play
- Samsung/SK Hynix captive demand
- 3D NAND growth (1000+ layers coming)
- Government support for domestic supply
- [[Japan]] restriction risk = Dongjin opportunity

**Bear:**
- Small vs Japanese giants (JSR, TOK)
- Limited EUV capability ([[Japan]] dominates)
- Customer concentration (Samsung, Hynix)
- Korea-listed, less accessible
- Won currency exposure
