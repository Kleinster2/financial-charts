**GLP-1 market:** $100B+ potential, Lilly and [[Novo Nordisk]] duopoly.

**US market share:** 58% (vs Novo 42%) — Lilly has taken the lead.

**Patent advantage:** Mounjaro/Zepbound (tirzepatide) has **~decade of patent life** remaining — insulated from generic threat hitting Novo in 2026.

**Zepbound vs Wegovy:** Beat Wegovy on weight loss in late 2024 study. Next-gen injectable and oral in late-stage trials.
