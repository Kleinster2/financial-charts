**Credo Semiconductor** — Active Electrical Cables (AEC) for GPU connectivity. High-speed SerDes. AI cluster specialist.

---

## Why Credo matters

Credo's Active Electrical Cables connect GPUs within racks — critical for AI clusters:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key product | Active Electrical Cables (AEC) |
| Technology | High-speed SerDes IP |
| AI exposure | GPU-to-GPU, GPU-to-switch |
| Growth | Explosive AI demand |

## Active Electrical Cables

**What's an AEC?**
- Copper cable with active electronics
- Signal conditioning extends reach
- Lower power than optical (short distances)
- Cost-effective for intra-rack

**Where AECs win:**
- GPU-to-switch within rack
- Short-reach high-bandwidth
- Power-sensitive applications
- Complements optical (longer distances)

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| **AEC** | Active electrical cables |
| **SerDes** | High-speed IP/chips |
| **Line cards** | Networking components |
| **PCIe retimers** | Signal conditioning |

**AI focus:** GPU cluster connectivity inside racks.

## AI cluster architecture

**How clusters connect:**
```
GPU ↔ AEC ↔ Switch ↔ Optical ↔ Other racks
    (Credo)  (Arista)  (Coherent)
```

**Credo's sweet spot:**
- Intra-rack: AEC dominates
- Rack-to-rack: Optical better
- Hybrid approach standard
- Both growing with AI

---

## NVIDIA relationship

**GPU connectivity:**
- NVIDIA GPU clusters use AECs
- Credo qualified supplier
- NVLink, InfiniBand connections
- Direct hyperscaler relationships too

**Growth tied to GPU shipments:** More GPUs = more AECs.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Approach | Credo vs |
|------------|----------|----------|
| [[Astera Labs]] | PCIe, CXL retimers | Different focus |
| Amphenol | Passive cables | Active = longer reach |
| TE Connectivity | Connectors | Active intelligence |
| Molex | Passive cables | Active = higher performance |

AEC technology = differentiated interconnect.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI GPU cluster demand
- AEC technology leader
- NVIDIA relationship
- High growth + margins
- TAM expanding with AI

**Bear:**
- Customer concentration
- Optical could extend into rack
- Competition from cable giants
- Execution on capacity ramp
- Valuation stretched
