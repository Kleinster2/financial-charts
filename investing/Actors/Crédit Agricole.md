## Price

![[aca-pa-vs-bnp-pa-price-chart.png]]
*ACA.PA (Crédit Agricole, blue) vs BNP.PA ([[BNP Paribas]], red) since Jan 2020. Both French banking giants have rallied sharply from COVID lows -- BNP up ~155%, CA up ~120%. BNP has outperformed driven by stronger CIB revenue growth and less French sovereign overhang. CA's 2024-2025 rally reflects record earnings momentum and Banco BPM optionality but French political risk (Moody's sovereign downgrade, Dec 2024) weighed more heavily on CA given its concentrated domestic exposure.*

## Financials (CASA, EUR B)

| Year | Revenue | Net income GS | CET1 % | Dividend/share |

## Italian strategy and Banco BPM

Crédit Agricole's Italian expansion is the most significant M&A story in European banking (2024-2025):

Timeline:
- Pre-2024: Held 9.9% of [[Banco BPM]] plus existing partnerships (Agos consumer finance, insurance)
- Nov 2024: [[UniCredit]] launches unsolicited EUR 10.1B bid for Banco BPM, rejected as undervaluing the company
- Dec 2024: CA increases Banco BPM stake to 15.1%, builds derivative position for additional 5.2% (total economic exposure ~19.8%). Italian government informally approves CA's plan
- Apr 2025: [[ECB]] authorizes CA to raise stake to 19.9%. Stake physically converted to 19.8%
- Jul 2025: CA applies for [[ECB]] approval to exceed 20%
- Late 2025: CA engages [[Deutsche Bank]] and Rothschild to advise on potential merger of CA Italia with Banco BPM. CEO Gavalda signals openness; BPM CEO Castagna calls CA merger the "clearest option"

Accounting impact: From Q4 2025, Banco BPM stake recognized under equity method. Initial negative consolidation impact of ~EUR 600M, but net positive ~EUR 200M including fair value and dividends.

Strategic rationale: Combined CA Italia + [[Banco BPM]] would create Italy's \#2 or \#3 bank. CA already has deep Italian partnerships (Agos, insurance distribution). Stake could reach ~35% post-merger.

## Risks

Eurozone macro exposure: Concentrated in [[France]] (largest market) and Italy (second-largest). French political instability (Dec 2024 Moody's sovereign downgrade) directly impacts bank ratings. Slow Eurozone growth weighs on loan demand.

Italian concentration risk: Deep exposure through CA Italia (~900 branches), Agos (consumer finance), [[Banco BPM]] stake (19.8%+), and potential merger. Italy's sovereign debt dynamics and political risk affect all of these.

Interest rate sensitivity: Net interest income benefits from higher rates but insurance liabilities and bond portfolios create offsetting headwinds. [[ECB]] rate cuts compress NII for retail books.

Cost of risk normalization: FY2024 cost of risk rose 11% to EUR 3.2B (Group). Consumer finance segment saw sharp profit decline (-26.6%). Economic slowdown would accelerate provisioning.

Complexity of cooperative structure: 39 regional banks operate semi-independently. Coordination costs, potential for divergent risk appetites. Regional banks' 54% ownership of CASA limits management flexibility.

[[Banco BPM]] integration risk: Potential EUR 600M negative accounting impact from consolidation. Regulatory approval timeline uncertain. [[UniCredit]] legal challenges add complexity.

Consumer finance headwinds: Sofinco/Agos exposed to household credit quality deterioration in [[France]] and Italy. Car loan concentration (53% of outstandings) ties performance to auto market cycles.

Regulatory: Basel IV implementation timeline, EU green bond standard compliance costs, [[MiCA]] implications for payment activities.
