## What makes Whisker Labs, Whisker Labs

**Largest IoT grid monitoring network in the US — built by accident.** Whisker Labs started as a fire prevention company: its Ting sensor monitors home electrical systems for fire risk. But with 1M+ sensors across America (94% of homes within 1 mile), they accidentally built the most comprehensive real-time power quality monitoring network in the country.

**The insight:** When data centers connect to the grid, they introduce harmonic distortions that degrade power quality for nearby residents. Whisker Labs is the only entity measuring this at scale.

## Data center grid impact (Bloomberg report, 2025)

Using Whisker Labs + DC Byte data, Bloomberg reported:

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Worst power distortions | 50%+ of affected households within 20 miles of significant DC activity |
| Hardest-hit market | Northern Virginia (Data Center Alley) |
| Measurement | Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) |
| Trend | Expected to worsen as larger DCs connect |

Bob Marshall: "Harmonics are a pretty good canary in the coal mine for early signs of stress and problems."

**Why it matters for investors:**
- Grid degradation = regulatory/political risk for DC expansion
- Validates [[Power constraints]] thesis — grid wasn't built for this
- Could drive new regulations on [[DC power quality]] requirements
- Supports [[BYOP]] thesis — DCs may need to self-generate to avoid grid harm

## Technology

**Ting sensor platform:**
- Real-time home electrical system monitoring
- Detects fire risk from electrical faults
- Measures power quality (voltage, harmonics, THD)
- Added Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measurements Nov 2024
- IoT network aggregates data across 1M+ homes

**Ting Insights (AI-powered):**
- Grid intelligence platform for utilities
- Identifies stress patterns across service territories
- Predicts equipment failures
- Enables proactive maintenance

## Grid resilience context

| Statistic | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Grid disruptions | 2x in past decade vs prior decade | Climate Central 2024 |
| Investment needed | $3.1 trillion before 2030 | Rystad Energy |
| DC build time | 1-2 years from announcement | Industry standard |
| Grid upgrade time | 3-5+ years | Utility average |

The mismatch between DC build speed (fast) and grid upgrade speed (slow) is the core problem Whisker Labs' data illuminates.

## Funding

| Round | Lead | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| State Farm Ventures | State Farm | Oversubscribed; fire prevention angle |
| Debt financing | — | Per Crunchbase |

Investors: State Farm Ventures, Polaris Partners. Relatively modest funding — product is low-cost sensor subsidized by insurance partners.

---

## Business model

- **[[Insurance]] partnerships:** State Farm distributes Ting sensors to policyholders (fire prevention reduces claims)
- **Utility partnerships:** Sells grid intelligence data to utilities
- **Data licensing:** Power quality data to researchers, regulators, media (Bloomberg)
- **[[Consumer]]:** Fire prevention monitoring service

## Investment relevance

Whisker Labs is not investable directly but is a critical **signal source** for the AI power thesis:
- Their data quantifies grid degradation from DCs
- Provides early warning of regulatory backlash
- Validates the [[BYOP]]/[[Power constraints]] thesis
- Could become acquisition target for utility or grid company
