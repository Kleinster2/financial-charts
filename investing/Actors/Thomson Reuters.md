## Competitive position

| Market | Position | Competitors |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Legal research | \#1 (Westlaw) | LexisNexis (RELX) |
| Tax software | Top 3 | [[Intuit]], Wolters Kluwer |
| News | Reuters News | Bloomberg, AP |

**Westlaw moat:** Decades of case law, attorney workflows built around it. High switching costs.

## February 2026: Claude Cowork selloff

**Feb 3-4, 2026:** Stock fell **-18%** — record single-day loss — on [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork launch]]. Hit lowest level since June 2021.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Two-day decline | -18% |
| Level | Lowest since Jun 2021 |
| Catalyst | Claude Cowork legal automation |

**Why Thomson Reuters is exposed:**
- Westlaw's value proposition: saving lawyer time on research
- AI legal assistants could commoditize this workflow
- CoCounsel (their own AI) may not differentiate enough
- High P/E left room for compression

**Bull case:** Westlaw's proprietary case law database is the moat, not the interface. AI needs data to work — Thomson Reuters has it.
