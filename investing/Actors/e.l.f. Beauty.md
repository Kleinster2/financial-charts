## The dupe economy

e.l.f. is the beneficiary of beauty's dupe trend:
- 27% of US beauty shoppers bought dupes in 2024
- e.l.f. positioned as the "smart" prestige alternative
- Social media ([[TikTok]] "dupe culture") drives awareness
- Key advantage: speed to market on trending formulas

## FY26 guidance

| Metric | FY26E |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $1.55-1.57B (+18-20%) |
| Adjusted EPS | $2.80-2.85 (down from $3.39) |
| Growth drivers | International, skincare (Naturium brand) |

**EPS decline:** Despite revenue growth, tariff headwinds ([[China]] manufacturing) and investment in international expansion compress near-term earnings.

---

## Stock trajectory

| Period | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| 2020 low | ~$15 |
| 2024 peak | ~$220 |
| Current (Jan 2026) | ~$110 |
| From peak | -50% |

**De-rated** on growth normalization concerns (77% → 28% → 18-20%) and tariff exposure. But still growing faster than any peer.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Tariffs** | Heavy [[China]] manufacturing exposure |
| **Growth normalization** | 77% → 28% → 18-20% deceleration |
| **Fad risk** | Dupe culture could shift |
| **Competition** | Other mass brands copying playbook |
| **Valuation** | Still ~22x EBITDA despite correction |
| **EPS declining** | FY26 EPS below FY25 despite revenue growth |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 25 straight quarters of share gains — unprecedented
- Only 33% brand awareness (vs 55% for leader) = headroom
- International only 20%, growing 60%
- #1 by units in US cosmetics
- Gen Z loyalty + social media moat
- Skincare expansion (Naturium) diversifies

**Bear:**
- Growth decelerating meaningfully
- Tariff headwinds ([[China]] manufacturing)
- Stock still premium despite correction
- EPS declining in FY26
- Dupe culture is fickle
- Bigger brands will eventually respond
