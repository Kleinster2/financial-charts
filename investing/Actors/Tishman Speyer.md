## Challenges

### Office exposure

Heavy office concentration faces post-COVID headwinds:
- Remote work reducing demand
- Flight to quality (benefits trophy assets)
- Refinancing pressure at higher rates

### Stuyvesant Town (2006)

Tishman Speyer and [[Blackstone]] bought Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village for $5.4B in 2006 — one of the largest residential deals ever. The investment failed during the financial crisis, and the firms handed keys back to lenders in 2010. Cautionary tale on leverage and rent regulation risk.
