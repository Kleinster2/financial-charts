## Key contributions

### Time consistency (1977)

Paper: "Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans" (with Kydland), *Journal of Political Economy*.

**The problem:** A central bank announces it will keep inflation low. But once wages and prices are set based on that promise, the bank faces temptation to inflate for short-term employment gains. Rational actors anticipate this, so inflation ends up high even though everyone wants it low.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time inconsistency** | Optimal policy changes over time even if preferences don't |
| **Credibility** | Announcements only work if actors believe them |
| **Solution** | Commitment mechanisms (rules, independence, reputation) |

**Real-world impact:**
- Independent central banks
- Inflation targeting regimes
- Fed forward guidance
- [[Fed independence]] as institutional design

### Real Business Cycle theory (1982)

Paper: "Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations" (with Kydland), *Econometrica*.

**Innovation:** Built quantitative models showing that productivity/technology shocks (supply-side) could explain observed business cycle patterns — challenging the Keynesian view that cycles were primarily demand-driven.

**Methodological legacy:**
- Pioneered calibrated DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) models
- Standard framework at central banks and academic macro
- Microfoundations for macro models

See [[Real Business Cycle theory]] for full concept.

### Other contributions

| Topic | Contribution |
|-------|--------------|
| **Labor supply** | Argued taxes explain US vs Europe hours worked differences |
| **Great Depression** | Attributed length to New Deal labor policies |
| **Economic development** | Emphasized institutions and barriers to technology adoption |

| Shared with | [[Finn Kydland]] |
| Citation | "for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles" |

| RBC theory | Supply shocks (AI productivity?) can drive cycles |
| DSGE models | How central banks forecast and set policy |
| Forward guidance | Why Fed "dots" and guidance matter |
