## Why Phoenix matters

Sun Belt DC expansion:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Phoenix metro, Arizona |
| Power | Solar abundant |
| Key players | Microsoft, Google, AWS |
| Synergy | TSMC fab |

## Why Phoenix?

**Strategic advantages:**

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| Solar | Abundant renewable |
| Land | Cheap, available |
| Power | APS grid capacity |
| Climate | Dry (cooling friendly) |
| TSMC | Semiconductor cluster |
| Growth | Population boom |

## Major investments

| Company | Investment |
|---------|------------|
| Microsoft | Massive expansion |
| Google | Growing presence |
| AWS | West region capacity |
| Meta | Data centers |
| CyrusOne | Major campus |

## TSMC Arizona

**Semiconductor synergy:**
- TSMC $40B+ fab investment
- 3nm/4nm production
- Chip + DC cluster
- Supply chain proximity

---

## Solar advantage

**Renewable power:**
- 300+ days of sun
- Utility-scale solar cheap
- ESG/carbon goals
- 24/7 solar potential

---

## Cooling considerations

**Hot climate trade-off:**
- Air cooling less efficient
- Evaporative cooling = water use
- Pushing liquid cooling adoption
- Not deal-breaker
