**Shop Pay** — [[Shopify]]'s accelerated checkout. 200M+ users, fastest-growing checkout button, taking share from [[PayPal]].

---

## Why Shop Pay matters

Shop Pay is winning the [[Checkout wars]] through network effects:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | **200M+** (Q4 2024) |
| Q1 2025 GMV | **$22B** |
| YoY growth | **+57%** (Q1 2025) |
| Share of Shopify GMV | **38%** (up from 33% in 2023) |
| Cyber 5 2024 growth | **+58%** YoY |

Shop Pay alone processes more than many standalone payment companies.

---

## Conversion advantage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Conversion lift (returning users) | **+36%** vs standard checkout |
| Speed | Pre-filled everything for 200M users |
| Target GMV | $40-$200 cart values |
| Mobile advantage | Removes typing friction |

**Key insight:** First-time users see less lift (must create account), but returning users across any Shopify store get full benefit.

---

## How it works

1. **First purchase:** User creates Shop Pay account at any Shopify merchant
2. **Subsequent purchases:** One-tap checkout at any of 2M+ Shopify merchants
3. **Shop app:** Tracks orders, recommendations, rewards across merchants
4. **Shop Cash:** Rewards program drives repeat usage

The network effect: Every new user benefits every Shopify merchant. Every new merchant benefits every user.

## Growth trajectory

| Period | GMV | Growth |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Q3 2024 | $17B | +42% YoY |
| Q4 2024 | — | +50% YoY |
| Cyber 5 2024 | — | +58% YoY |
| Q1 2025 | $22B | **+57% YoY** |

Shop Pay is Shopify's fastest-growing product.

## Competitive position

### vs PayPal
- Shop Pay: Pre-saved across Shopify network

## Strategic value to Shopify

| Impact | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Take rate | Higher margin than basic Shopify Payments |
| Lock-in | Merchants stay for checkout network |
| Data | Cross-merchant purchase insights |
| Consumer brand | Shop app drives engagement |

Shop Pay is why Shopify's Merchant Solutions revenue (70% of total) grows faster than Subscription revenue.

---

## Shopify Payments integration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Shopify Payments GMV penetration | **64%** (Q1 2025) |
| Powered by | [[Stripe]] backend |
| Shop Pay share of Payments | 38% |

Shop Pay requires Shopify Payments — merchants can't use it with third-party processors.

---

## Expansion beyond Shopify

Shop Pay increasingly available off-platform:
- **Instagram/Facebook Shops** — Shop Pay checkout
- **Google Shopping** — Shop Pay option
- **Enterprise partners** — Select non-Shopify merchants

Still primarily Shopify ecosystem, but expanding acceptance broadens network effect.

---

## Investment implications

Shop Pay growth directly benefits [[Shopify]] stock:
- Higher take rate than basic payment processing
- Drives Merchant Solutions revenue growth
- Creates switching costs (merchants lose checkout network if they leave)

**Competitive threat:** Shop Pay expansion eats into PayPal and other checkout buttons. Merchants adding Shop Pay often see it cannibalize PayPal volume.
