## Investment case

Bull:
- Mission-critical communications infrastructure — high switching costs
- AI tailwind — conversational AI, intelligent routing on Twilio APIs
- Reaccelerating growth (15% in Q3 2025 vs. 7% in FY2024)
- Margin expansion + aggressive buybacks ($5B cumulative)
- ROIC 40%+ (vs. -4.5% five-year avg)

Bear:
- SMS pricing commoditization / [[Amazon]] Connect competition
- [[Segment]] still sub-scale vs. standalone CDPs
- Founder departure may slow innovation (Lawson now CEO of [[Inertia Enterprises]])
- Activist-driven cost cuts may underinvest in R&D
