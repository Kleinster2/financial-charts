## Technology

### Portal terminal

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Throughput | Up to **100 Gbps** backhaul |
| EIRP | **20x higher** than previous gen |
| Status | Passed operational tests (Jun 2025) |
| Claim | Most powerful commercial comms phased array ever built |

**First test:** Collected data from US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program spacecraft.

### Key innovations

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost vs. existing phased array | **10x reduction** |
| Time to field | **5x reduction** |
| Approach | Vertically integrated, software-defined |

---

## Manufacturing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Facility | 35,000 sq ft, Torrance, CA |
| Capacity | **16 Portal arrays/month** |
| Approach | Designed for mass production |

---

## Deployment

| Milestone | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|
| First sites | Q4 2025 |
| Global deployment | 2026 |
| Six continents | End of 2026 |

**Goal:** Surge capacity, redundancy, and global reach for modern satellite missions.

## Business model

**Ground Station as a Service:**
- Shared infrastructure for satellite operators
- Software-defined, flexible capacity
- Alternative to building dedicated ground stations

**Customer demo:** Planet Labs — validated 10x cost reduction.

---

## Market context

**Problem:** Satellite ground infrastructure is:
- Expensive to build
- Inflexible
- Bottleneck for satellite data

**Opportunity:** Mega-constellations (Starlink, OneWeb, etc.) need scalable ground segment.

---

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Northwood Space** | Shared, high-throughput phased array |
| AWS Ground Station | Cloud-integrated |
| Microsoft Azure Orbital | Cloud-integrated |
| KSAT | Traditional ground station network |
| Leaf Space | Ground station as a service |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Elite backers (a16z, Founders Fund)
- 10x cost reduction demonstrated
- Most powerful commercial phased array
- Vertically integrated manufacturing
- Mega-constellation tailwind

**Bear:**
- Private — no direct investment
- Early stage, pre-revenue
- AWS/Azure competition
- Execution risk on global deployment
- Satellite market cyclicality
