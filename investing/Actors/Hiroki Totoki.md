# Hiroki Totoki

CEO of [[Sony]], architect of the company's transformation from consumer electronics manufacturer to entertainment conglomerate. Financial background — thinks in business models, portfolio strategy, and top-down industry positioning. Under his leadership, entertainment grew from ~30% to ~60% of [[Sony]]'s revenue.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | CEO, Sony Group Corporation |
| HQ | Tokyo, [[Japan]] |
| Background | Finance, business strategy |
| Key achievement | Entertainment pivot (30% → 60% of revenue) |
| Returned to HQ | 2013 (from subsidiary) |

## Strategic vision

Totoki inherited a [[Sony]] facing existential pressure in consumer electronics. Korean and Chinese competitors (backed by massive domestic markets) made volume-and-price competition unsustainable for Sony. His response: pivot to content creation.

**The logic:**
- Consumer electronics in the digital era → hard to differentiate → invites low-cost entrants
- Entertainment content = unique IP with recurring value
- Gaming, music, and film are defensible moats
- Technology enables but doesn't define the business

Three pillars (by revenue share, 2024):

| Segment | Share | Key assets |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Gaming | Largest | [[PlayStation]], first-party studios (God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Helldivers) |
| Music | Growing | Catalog investments (with [[Apollo]] financing), recording labels |
| Film | Significant | Sony Pictures, anime distribution, [[Netflix]] deals |

## Apollo music financing partnership

Sony entered a partnership with [[Apollo]] for music catalog investments. The logic: music catalogs are low-risk, low-return assets that fit [[Apollo]]'s long-dated private credit model perfectly. Different capital sources have different risk appetites and time horizons — catalogs need patient capital, which is Apollo's specialty.

## On anime

Anime has gone global thanks to simultaneous worldwide distribution via streaming platforms. This has both expanded the market and mitigated piracy risk — when content is available legally and immediately everywhere, the piracy incentive drops.

## Personal

- Joined [[Sony]] HQ in 2013 during a "very severe time" — financial performance was poor and talent was leaving
- Self-described top-down thinker: focuses on which industries are suitable, where Sony is capable of competing
- Loves music and TV dramas
- Attended the Oasis reunion concert in Tokyo (two dome shows after 20 years)
- Admits to being a "very primitive level" gamer despite running PlayStation
