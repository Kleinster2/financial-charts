**Dario Amodei** — Anthropic CEO. Ex-OpenAI VP Research. Safety-focused AI, Amazon partnership.

---

## Why Amodei matters

Dario leads the "safety-first" AI lab that's become a serious OpenAI competitor:

| Aspect | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| Anthropic CEO | #2 or #3 AI lab |
| Ex-OpenAI | Left over safety disagreements |
| Amazon partnership | $4B+ investment |
| Claude | Competing with GPT, Gemini |

---

## OpenAI departure

**Left OpenAI (2021)** with sister Daniela Amodei (now Anthropic President) and key researchers.

**Reported reasons:**
- Disagreements over safety approach
- Concerns about commercialization speed
- Wanted more cautious scaling

**Who left with him:**
- Core safety/alignment researchers
- Created talent drain from OpenAI

---

## Anthropic

See [[Anthropic]] for company details.

**Amodei's approach:**
- "Constitutional AI" — safety through principles
- More cautious public communications than OpenAI
- Enterprise focus (less consumer splash)
- Claude positioned as "safer" alternative

**Fundraising under Amodei:**
- Google: $2B+
- Amazon: $4B
- Salesforce, Spark, various VCs
- Valuation: $60B+ (Dec 2024)

---

## Amazon relationship

**$4B investment** — largest Anthropic backer.

**What Amazon gets:**
- Claude on AWS Bedrock
- Anthropic uses AWS Trainium chips
- Alternative to Microsoft/OpenAI

**Tension:** Anthropic also takes Google money — playing hyperscalers against each other.

---

## Safety positioning

**Public stance:**
- AI safety is existential priority
- Advocates for regulation
- More measured than Altman's "move fast"

**Critic view:**
- Safety positioning is marketing
- Still scaling as fast as possible
- Regulatory capture play

**Reality:** Probably both — genuine safety concern AND competitive positioning.

---

## Technical background

- PhD Physics (Princeton)
- VP Research at OpenAI
- Published researcher in AI safety
- More academic than Altman's operator style

---

## Daniela Amodei

**Sister and Anthropic President:**
- Handles business/operations
- Dario focuses on research/product
- Sibling co-founder dynamic (like Collison brothers at Stripe)

---

## Competitive position

**Claude vs GPT vs Gemini:**
- Claude: Safety reputation, enterprise focus
- GPT: Consumer mindshare, Microsoft distribution
- Gemini: Google integration, multimodal

**Coding tools:** Claude Code gaining share (24% per CB Insights vs GitHub Copilot 24.9%)

---

## Risks / Considerations

- Caught between Google and Amazon
- OpenAI has more consumer mindshare
- Burn rate high, needs continued fundraising
- Safety positioning may limit speed
