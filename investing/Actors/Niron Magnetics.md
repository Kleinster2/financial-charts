## Technology

**Iron-nitride magnets:**
- Alternative to NdFeB (neodymium) magnets
- No rare earth elements required
- Eliminates China supply chain risk
- Target: EV motors, industrial applications

---

## Origin story

**Jonathan Rowntree (CEO):**
> "Prices of rare earths shot up around the world, and that was really the trigger for us. We realized we needed an alternative."

**Catalyst:** 2010 China rare earth export cuts during Japan territorial dispute — first use of REE as geopolitical weapon.

## Investors

| Investor | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **General Motors** | Strategic (EV supply chain) |
| **Stellantis** | Strategic (EV supply chain) |

**Strategic rationale:** Automakers seeking to eliminate rare earth dependency for EV motors.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Company founded | Post-2010 |
| GM/Stellantis investment | — |
| First commercial facility | **Early 2027** |

## Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Certification** | New tech takes years to certify for motors |
| **Scale** | Far from matching NdFeB production volumes |
| **Performance** | Must match rare earth magnet specs |
| **Adoption** | OEMs slow to change qualified suppliers |

---

## Competitive landscape

**Other rare earth substitution efforts:**

| Company | Approach | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Niron** | Iron-nitride magnets | 2027 commercial |
| Tesla | REE-free motor design | Announced 2023, not yet deployed |
| BMW | REE-free specialty motor | In production (some models) |

**Reality:** Even Tesla still uses rare earths throughout vehicles despite 2023 announcement.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Solves rare earth dependency
- Strategic OEM backing (GM, Stellantis)
- Geopolitical tailwind
- If successful, massive TAM

**Bear:**
- Technology unproven at scale
- Years from commercial production
- Certification timeline uncertain
- Private (illiquid)
- Incumbent NdFeB magnets entrenched
