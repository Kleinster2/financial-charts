## OnlyFans acquisition

Acquired 75% stake in Fenix International Ltd (OnlyFans parent) from founders Tim and Guy Stokely in **2018**. Later acquired remaining 25% — now sole owner.

**Price paid:** Not disclosed, but platform was much smaller then. Extraordinary ROI given $1.8B+ already extracted in dividends while retaining 100% ownership of $7-8B asset.

## Background

**MyFreeCams connection:** Before OnlyFans, Radvinsky was involved in the adult webcam industry. This gave him insight into creator economics and payment processing challenges that informed OnlyFans strategy.

Low public profile — rarely gives interviews, no social media presence. Operates from behind the scenes.

## Potential exit

Bloomberg reported (2025) discussions to sell majority stake to consortium led by Forest Road Company at $7B valuation. David and Simon Reuben (British billionaires) may participate.

**Why sell:** Has already extracted $1.8B+. Growth slowing (9% YoY). Adult content limits strategic options. Take money off table while valuation holds.
