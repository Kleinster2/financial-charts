## Key theses & frameworks

### Inflation persistence (2021-2022)
Bianco was among the earliest and loudest voices arguing that post-COVID [[inflation]] would be persistent, not "transitory" as the [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] and consensus claimed. He argued:
- Massive [[fiscal stimulus]] combined with [[supply chain]] disruptions created structural inflationary pressure
- The [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] was behind the curve and would need to raise rates far more than markets expected
- The [[bond market]] was mispricing [[inflation]] risk dramatically

### Bond bear market thesis
Has argued since ~2020 that the 40-year [[bond]] bull market that began in 1981 is over. Key reasoning:
- Structural shift in [[inflation]] regime from deflationary to inflationary
- Massive [[fiscal deficit|fiscal deficits]] creating persistent [[Treasury]] supply
- [[De-globalization]] and [[reshoring]] are inherently inflationary
- The [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] will struggle to bring [[inflation]] back to 2% sustainably

### Fed credibility framework
Bianco consistently analyzes [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] communication vs. action, arguing that forward guidance has become a straitjacket that reduces policy flexibility. He was critical of the [[Federal Reserve|Fed's]] 2020 framework shift to average inflation targeting (FAIT).

### Crypto/DeFi macro bridge
Notably for a traditional macro analyst, Bianco has been intellectually curious about [[DeFi]] and [[blockchain]] technology, arguing it represents a genuine innovation in financial plumbing — not just speculation.

## Track record

### Hits
- 2021-22 inflation call: Called inflation persistent when "Team Transitory" dominated; proved correct as CPI hit 9.1%
- Fed behind the curve: Correctly argued the [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] would need to hike far more aggressively than dot plots suggested
- Bond market selloff: Called the historic 2022-2023 [[Treasury]] bear market
- 2019 repo stress: Flagged funding market fragility before the September 2019 repo spike
- Credit market analysis: Consistently strong calls on [[credit spread]] direction

### Misses / debates
- Recession calls: Has at times been too bearish on the economy; the 2022-23 recession he expected didn't materialize
- Inflation persistence post-2023: Inflation has come down more than his most hawkish scenarios suggested, though remains above 2%
- Bond bear market timing: While directionally correct on the secular shift, shorter-term bond rallies have caught him offside
- Rate cut skepticism: Has been skeptical of [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] rate cuts, but the [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] did begin cutting in late 2024
