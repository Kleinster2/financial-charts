## Bellini era (2021-2025)

[[Riccardo Bellini]] as CEO:
- Achieved **B Corp certification** (Oct 2021) — sustainability as brand pillar
- Partnered with Gabriela Hearst on elevated positioning
- Hired [[Chemena Kamali]] to revive boho-chic heritage
- Departed for [[Valentino]] CEO role (2025)

---

## Brand positioning

**Heritage:** Bohemian femininity, Parisian ease, romantic details

**Challenge:** Squeezed between Richemont's dominant jewelry brands (Cartier, Van Cleef) and struggling to achieve scale. The "Other" segment consistently loses money.

**Opportunity:** Strong creative identity, sustainability credentials, devoted customer base
