**Mercado Libre** (MELI) — LatAm's largest tech company. E-commerce + fintech flywheel. $110B market cap, 27 consecutive quarters of 30%+ growth. AI-driven credit scoring enabled $11B loan portfolio.

> **Key insight:** Mercado Libre is the Amazon + [[PayPal]] + Square of Latin America, but with tighter integration. The e-commerce marketplace generates transaction data that powers Mercado Pago's credit underwriting—instant loan approvals for merchants based on their sales history. This data moat compounds: more sellers → more data → better credit → more sellers.

## Business model

**Two reinforcing flywheels:**

```
E-commerce (Mercado Libre)     [[Fintech]] (Mercado Pago)
         ↓                              ↓
   Transaction data  ←→  Credit underwriting
         ↓                              ↓
   Logistics network        Digital wallet
         ↓                              ↓
     More sellers    ←→    More users
```

## Geographic mix

| Country | Role |
|---------|------|
| **[[Brazil]]** | Largest market (~55% revenue) |
| **[[Mexico]]** | Second largest, fastest growing |
| **[[Argentina]]** | Founded here, significant presence |
| [[Chile]], Colombia, Peru | Growing markets |

---

## Logistics moat

**Mercado Envios:**
- Own fulfillment network
- [[Robotics]] and automation investments
- Lowered free shipping threshold in [[Brazil]] → accelerated GMV
- Same-day/next-day delivery in major metros

Logistics investment = defensibility against Amazon's LatAm expansion.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Threat level | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Amazon LatAm | Medium | Logistics gaps, less fintech |
| [[Nubank]] | Medium | [[Fintech]] overlap, less commerce |
| Sea Group (Shopee) | Low | Retreated from LatAm |
| Local banks | Low | Digital laggards |

**Moat:** Integrated ecosystem. Amazon has e-commerce. Nubank has fintech. Mercado Libre has both, with data flowing between them.

---

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- LatAm e-commerce penetration still low (~15% vs 25%+ developed)
- [[Fintech]] TAM massive (unbanked/underbanked population)
- Credit portfolio growing 80%+ with manageable NPLs
- AI tools driving seller productivity
- Logistics moat deepening

**Bear case:**
- [[Brazil]] macro risk (currency, rates)
- Credit cycle turn could hit loan book
- Amazon/Shopee competition
- Regulatory risk on fintech
