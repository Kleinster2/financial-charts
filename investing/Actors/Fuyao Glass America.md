## *American Factory* documentary

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Directors | Steven Bognar, Julia Reichert |
| Released | Aug 2019 ([[Netflix]]) |
| Production | Higher Ground Productions ([[Barack Obama]] and [[Michelle Obama]]'s company) |
| Award | Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (Feb 2020) |

Documented the cultural collision between American and Chinese workers after Fuyao reopened the former [[General Motors]] Moraine plant. Key themes: deindustrialization of the Rust Belt, labor rights and union opposition, contrasting workplace cultures, and automation as the looming threat to all workers regardless of nationality.

## Federal investigation (2024-2025)

On July 26, 2024, DHS, FBI, and IRS agents executed search warrants at the Moraine plant and ~30 other Dayton-area locations. The investigation, ongoing since approximately December 2019, focused on third-party labor practices.

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| Jul 2024 | Federal raid on Moraine plant and ~30 locations |
| Apr 2025 | Civil forfeiture complaint alleges $126M money laundering / illegal staffing operation |
| Late 2025 | House Appropriations Committee seeks answers on alleged CCP ties |

The complaint centers on E-Z Iron Shop LLC and related entities that allegedly employed undocumented workers from Mexico, Guatemala, and China, housing them and transporting them to Fuyao and other factories. On the day of the raid, 148 E-Z Iron workers had badged into Fuyao. No criminal charges have been filed against Fuyao as of late 2025 — the company states third-party staffing companies were the target.

## Tariff exposure and mitigation

Fuyao's strategy of localizing ~70% of U.S. production domestically has proven effective as a tariff hedge:

| Period | Tariff environment |
|--------|-------------------|
| 2019 | 25% tariff on Chinese auto glass imports |
| Mar 2025 | Additional 20% → total 45% on Chinese imports |
| Peak 2025 | Layered tariffs reached 145% on some Chinese goods |
| Oct 2025 | [[US-China trade]] agreement in Busan reduced reciprocal tariffs to 10% through Nov 2026 |

[[Bank of America]] noted Fuyao passed tariff costs to clients without losing orders. [[Goldman Sachs]] reaffirmed buy rating citing the global production network. Parent stock up ~30% YTD in 2025 despite trade turmoil.

## Investment angle

Not directly investable — FGA is a subsidiary. Parent tickers: 600660.SS (Shanghai), 3606.HK (Hong Kong), FYGGY (US OTC).

Bull:
- Near-monopoly position (~30%+ global share) with cost advantages

- $400M Illinois expansion adds capacity in trade-war-resistant geography

Bear:
- Federal investigation overhang — scope and outcome uncertain
- Founder succession — [[Cao Hui]] untested as chairman
- US-China geopolitical risk could extend to manufacturing scrutiny (cf. [[ZPMC]] crane controversy)
- Currency risk (CNY reporting, USD operations)
- Cyclical exposure to global auto production
