**Appen** — Australian data annotation company. Once the leader, now struggling against [[Scale AI]]. Cautionary tale of AI infrastructure commoditization.

---

## Why Appen matters

Appen shows what happens when a picks-and-shovels play gets disrupted:

| Metric | Peak (2020) | Now (2025) |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Market cap | $5B AUD | ~$300M AUD |
| Share price | $40+ AUD | ~$2 AUD |
| Revenue | $600M | Declining |
| Status | Leader | Struggling |

**The lesson**: Data annotation looked like infrastructure. Then [[Scale AI]] ate their lunch.

## Business model

**Crowd-sourced annotation:**
- 1M+ contractors globally
- Text, image, audio, video labeling
- Quality assurance layers
- Enterprise customers

**Key customers (historical):**
- [[Google]] (was ~30% of revenue)
- [[Meta]]
- [[Microsoft]]
- [[Amazon]]

---

## What went wrong

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Customer concentration | [[Google]] cut spending |
| [[Scale AI]] competition | Better tech, better margins |
| Crowd quality issues | Inconsistent outputs |
| AI efficiency gains | Customers need less data |
| Management turnover | 4 CEOs in 4 years |

**The death spiral**: Lost key customers → cut investment → quality declined → lost more customers.

## Scale AI comparison

| Aspect | Appen | [[Scale AI]] |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Model | Crowd marketplace | Managed + platform |
| Tech investment | Low | High |
| Quality control | Basic | ML-assisted |
| Valuation | ~$200M USD | $29B |
| Growth | Declining | 2x+ annually |

Scale AI invested in tooling and quality. Appen stayed a labor marketplace.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | APX (ASX) |
| HQ | Sydney, [[Australia]] |
| Market cap | ~$300M AUD |
| Status | Restructuring |

## Investment angle

**Bull (turnaround):**
- Depressed valuation
- Still has enterprise relationships
- AI demand growing overall
- New management refocusing

**Bear (value trap):**
- Scale AI dominance
- Customer concentration unresolved
- Annotation commoditizing
- Synthetic data threat
- Management instability

**My take**: Appen is likely a value trap. The annotation market is growing, but Appen is losing share. [[Scale AI]]'s platform advantage compounds. Avoid.

## Lessons for AI infrastructure

1. **Picks and shovels can be disrupted** — Annotation looked essential, but tech differentiation matters
2. **Customer concentration kills** — 30% to one customer is existential risk
3. **Invest in the platform, not just labor** — Scale AI's ML tools beat Appen's crowd
4. **Quality compounds** — Better annotations → better models → more customers → more data → better quality
