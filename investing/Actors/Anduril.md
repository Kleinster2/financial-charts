## Why Anduril matters

Leading defense tech startup:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | **$30.5B** (Oct 2025) |
| Raised | **$6.84B** |
| Founded | 2017 |
| Founder | Palmer Luckey |
| Revenue | $500M+ |

---

## Palmer Luckey

**Founder background:**
- Created Oculus VR
- Sold to Facebook ($2B)
- Left Facebook controversially
- Founded Anduril at 24
- [[Defense]] tech visionary

---

## Lattice OS

**AI operating system:**
- Sensor fusion platform
- Autonomous decision-making
- Command & control
- Connects all Anduril products

Software backbone of everything.

---

## Product portfolio

| Product | Category |
|---------|----------|
| Lattice | AI/software platform |
| Sentry Tower | Autonomous surveillance |
| Ghost | Autonomous drone (air) |
| Dive-LD | Autonomous underwater |
| Roadrunner | Counter-drone |
| Fury | Strike drone |

---

## Roadrunner

**Counter-drone system:**
- Jet-powered interceptor
- Reusable (lands vertically)
- Autonomous targeting
- Ukraine interest

Counter-UAS = hot market.

---

## Business model

**Different from legacy defense:**
- Own IP (not cost-plus)
- Software-defined
- Faster iteration
- Commercial-style development

Disrupting Lockheed/[[Raytheon]] model.

## Customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| US DoD | Multiple programs |
| US Border Patrol | Sentry towers |
| USMC | Ghost drones |
| [[UK]] Ministry of Defence | Various |
| [[Australia]] | [[AUKUS]] programs |

---

## Meta partnership (Jan 2026)

**AI-powered military helmet:**
- Partnership with [[Meta]] announced
- VR/AR features for US military
- Combines Anduril defense AI + Meta Reality Labs hardware

**Andrew Bosworth (Meta CTO):**
> Silicon Valley's new openness to work with US military is a "return to grace."

> "There's a much stronger patriotic underpinning than I think people give Silicon Valley credit for."

**Significance:** Major consumer tech company (Meta) partnering with defense startup. Signals broader Silicon Valley shift toward defense work.

---

## Ukraine connection

**Real-world validation:**
- Counter-drone systems tested
- Autonomous systems in theater
- Combat experience
- Accelerated development

---

## Rare earth exposure

Autonomous systems depend on rare earth permanent magnets:

| Product | Rare earth use |
|---------|----------------|
| Ghost drones | Motor magnets (Nd, Dy) |
| Roadrunner | Jet engine components |
| [[Sensors]] | Various REEs |

**Dec 2025 military denial**: [[China]] blocks all rare earth exports to military-affiliated buyers. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Risk**: As a defense startup, Anduril has less stockpile buffer than [[Lockheed Martin]]. Supply chain disruption could delay production.

**Mitigation**: Smaller product volumes than legacy primes. [[AUKUS]] partners ([[Australia]]) developing rare earth capacity.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Defense]] spending up
- Ukraine proving autonomous
- Software margins > hardware
- Palmer Luckey vision
- [[AUKUS]] tailwind

**Bear:**
- Still losing money
- Government contracting risk
- Competition (legacy + startups)
- Controversial founder
- Private = illiquid
- Rare earth supply vulnerability
