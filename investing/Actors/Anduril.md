## Product portfolio

| Product | Category |
|---------|----------|
| Lattice | AI/software platform |
| Sentry Tower | Autonomous surveillance |
| Ghost | Autonomous drone (air) |
| Dive-LD | Autonomous underwater |
| Roadrunner | Counter-drone |
| Fury | Strike drone |

---

## Roadrunner

**Counter-drone system:**
- Jet-powered interceptor
- Reusable (lands vertically)
- Autonomous targeting
- Ukraine interest

Counter-UAS = hot market.

---

## Business model

**Different from legacy defense:**
- Own IP (not cost-plus)

## Customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| US DoD | Multiple programs |
| US Border Patrol | Sentry towers |
| USMC | Ghost drones |
| UK Ministry of Defence | Various |
| Australia | AUKUS programs |

---

## Ukraine connection

**Real-world validation:**
- Counter-drone systems tested
- Autonomous systems in theater
- Combat experience
- Accelerated development

---

## Rare earth exposure

Autonomous systems depend on rare earth permanent magnets:

| Product | Rare earth use |
|---------|----------------|
| Ghost drones | Motor magnets (Nd, Dy) |
| Roadrunner | Jet engine components |
| Sensors | Various REEs |

**Dec 2025 military denial**: China blocks all rare earth exports to military-affiliated buyers. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Risk**: As a defense startup, Anduril has less stockpile buffer than [[Lockheed Martin]]. Supply chain disruption could delay production.

**Mitigation**: Smaller product volumes than legacy primes. AUKUS partners (Australia) developing rare earth capacity.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Defense spending up
- Ukraine proving autonomous
- Software margins > hardware
- Palmer Luckey vision
- AUKUS tailwind

**Bear:**
- Still losing money
- Government contracting risk
- Competition (legacy + startups)
- Controversial founder
- Private = illiquid
- Rare earth supply vulnerability
