AI researcher, post-training lead at [[Allen Institute for AI]] (Ai2).

Previously: [[Hugging Face]] research scientist, [[Google|DeepMind]], Facebook AI Research.

Founder of the [[ATOM Project]] (American Truly Open Models). Author of the definitive book on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. Writes the Interconnects newsletter. His team coined the term "RLVR" (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) in the Tulu 3 work before DeepSeek popularized it.

On ATOM's motivation: "July 2025, we had four or five DeepSeek-caliber Chinese open-weight models and zero from the US. That was the moment when I was like, I guess I have to spend energy on this because nobody else is gonna do it."
