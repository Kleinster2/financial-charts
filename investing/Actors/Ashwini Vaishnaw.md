## Why he matters for investors

Vaishnaw controls the policy levers for India's entire tech stack: semiconductors, AI, telecom, railways (largest employer, massive digitization budget), and media regulation. Any company building AI infrastructure in India — [[Nvidia]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Tata Group]], [[Yotta Data Services]] — needs his ministry's approvals and alignment.

His engineering + IAS + Wharton background makes him unusually fluent in both tech and governance — a rarity among global tech ministers.
