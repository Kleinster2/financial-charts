## Trump relationship

### March 2024 reversal

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Mar 1, 2024 | Yass meets Trump at Mar-a-Lago / Club for Growth retreat |
| Mar 2024 | Trump reverses longtime support for TikTok ban |
| Mar 2024 | Trump: Yass is "brilliant," "we're back in love" |

**Interpretation**: Steve Bannon and others see Yass's influence behind Trump's TikTok flip. Timing strongly suggestive.

### 2025 donations

| Date | Recipient | Amount | Context |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Jan 17, 2025 | MAGA Inc. | $1M | 3 days before Trump's first TikTok ban delay |
| Mar 6, 2025 | MAGA Inc. | $15M | 4 weeks before second delay; largest single contribution ever |
| 2025 | Trump White House ballroom | $2.5M+ | |

**Pattern**: First-ever donations to Trump-affiliated groups came precisely as TikTok fate was being negotiated. Reuters reports Yass leading White House discussions on potential TikTok US acquisition (with KKR).

## Tax controversy

### ProPublica investigation (2022)

ProPublica found Yass paid average federal tax rate of **19%** — far below Wall Street peers — despite earning $1B+/year.

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Estimated tax savings | $1B+ over 6 years (2013-2018) |
| Strategy | Convert short-term gains (40% tax) to long-term gains (20% tax) |
| Vehicle | Susquehanna Fundamental Investments fund |
| Net Investment Income Tax | Paid $0 in 2013-2014 on tax designed for traders |

**How it works**:
- High-frequency trading generates short-term gains (taxed ~40%)
- Susquehanna Fundamental Investments generates short-term losses + long-term gains
- Losses offset short-term gains; long-term gains replace income at 20% rate
- Net savings: $17-20 per $100 processed

**IRS challenges**: Yass and partners hit with $121M back taxes in 2019 after IRS successfully challenged certain deals.

**Expert view**: "Very suspicious and suggestive of potential abuse" — Gregg Polsky, UGA law professor retained by ProPublica.

|-------|--------|
| School choice | $50M+ (Students First, School Freedom Fund, Institute for Justice) |
| University of Austin | $100M (Nov 2025) |
| Cato Institute | Board vice chairman; ongoing support |

**Philosophy**: Libertarian — anti-tax, pro-market, school privatization. Quotes Milton Friedman on education choice.

## Personal

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|

## Investment relevance

**Why track Jeff Yass**:

1. **TikTok policy** — His $21B+ stake means he has massive incentive to influence US-China tech policy. Political donations correlate with regulatory delays.

2. **Political spending** — $100M+/cycle makes him one of largest GOP donors. His priorities (school choice, anti-tax) shape Republican policy.

3. **Susquehanna signals** — As controlling partner, his views drive $720B AUM positioning.

4. **Tax policy** — ProPublica exposure makes him poster child for carried interest / tax avoidance reform. Policy risk if Democrats gain power.
