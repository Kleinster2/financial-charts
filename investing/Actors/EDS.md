## Why EDS mattered

Created the IT outsourcing industry:

- **Facilities management**: Pioneered concept — let specialists handle your computing
- **Medicare goldmine**: 1965 legislation created claims-processing chaos; EDS organized it (40% of revenue by 1977)
- **Scale**: By 2008, 300,000 employees in 64 countries, $22B revenue
- **Legacy**: DXC Technology carries EDS DNA through HPE Enterprise Services lineage

## Business model innovation

**"Facilities management"** — radical idea in 1962:
- Companies focus on core business
- EDS handles all data processing
- More efficient, more economical
- First client: Collins Radio (1962)

Early wins: Mercantile Security Life, Frito-Lay, Medicare claims processing.

## GM era (1984-1996)

**Acquisition rationale**: GM needed to modernize $6B/year data processing.

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1984 | GM acquires EDS for $2.5B (largest ever for IT services) |
| 1985 | Revenue triples to $3.4B; employees grow to 44,000 |
| 1986 | Culture clash — Perot criticizes GM bureaucracy |
| 1986 | GM buys out Perot for $700M+ to end conflict |
| 1996 | GM spins off EDS |

**Perot vs GM**: Perot's lean, results-driven culture clashed with GM's bureaucracy. Famous quote: "The first EDSer to see a snake kills it. At GM, first thing you do is organize a committee on snakes."

## HP acquisition & decline (2008-2017)

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2008 | HP pays $13.9B |
| 2012 | HP writes off $8B |
| 2017 | Merged into DXC at ~$5-6B implied value |

**Value destruction**: HP's EDS deal may have been worse than infamous Autonomy acquisition.
