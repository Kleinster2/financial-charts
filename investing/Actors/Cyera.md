## Investment case

**Bull:** AI-era data explosion creates structural demand for DSPM; tripled revenue with Fortune 500 adoption; $9B but growing into it fast

**Bear:** DSPM could become a feature inside larger platforms ([[Wiz]], [[Palo Alto Networks]]); crowded security market; no public financials to verify growth claims
