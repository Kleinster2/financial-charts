**Benchmark** — Elite Silicon Valley VC, now in crosshairs of US-China tech investment politics.

## Why it matters

Benchmark investments in Chinese-founded AI startups are drawing China hawk criticism. As AI becomes strategic, VC funding flows become geopolitical.

## Key investments

| Company | What | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Butterfly Effect (Manus)** | AI agents | Sold to [[Meta]] Jan 2026 |
| Uber | Rideshare | IPO |
| Twitter | Social | Acquired |
| Discord | Social | Private |
| Snap | Social | IPO |

## Manus/Butterfly Effect controversy

- Benchmark invested in Butterfly Effect (Manus parent company)
- Chinese-founded AI agent startup
- Drew fire from China hawks in Washington
- Critics argued deal helped China develop cutting-edge AI
- Meta acquisition may resolve tension (US ownership now)

**The pattern:** US VCs funding Chinese AI talent → political risk
