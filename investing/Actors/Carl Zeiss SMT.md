## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Oberkochen, Germany |
| Parent | Carl Zeiss AG |
| ASML stake | 24.9% (€1B) |
| EUV optics share | **100%** |
| Zeiss Group revenue | ~€12B (FY 2024/25) |

## Why they matter

**Only supplier of EUV-grade mirrors in the world.**

[[EUV lithography]] requires multilayer mirrors (molybdenum/silicon) with atomic-level precision. If scaled to the size of Germany, the largest surface irregularity would be 0.1mm.

No other company can manufacture optics at this precision level.

## Technical details

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mirror type | Multilayer Mo/Si reflectors |
| Wavelength | 13.5nm EUV |
| Current NA | 0.33 (Low-NA EUV) |
| Next-gen NA | 0.55 ([[High-NA EUV]]) |
| Precision | Atomic-level surface accuracy |

EUV light cannot use traditional glass lenses (absorbed instantly) — must use reflective optics.

## ASML relationship

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| ASML stake | 24.9% |
| Investment | €1B |
| Partnership duration | 30+ years |
| R&D commitment | €220M |
| Capex/supply chain | €540M over 6 years |

**Not just a supplier** — strategic partnership with equity stake signals deep mutual dependence.

## High-NA EUV development

Zeiss and ASML jointly developing [[High-NA EUV]] optics:

| Generation | NA | Status |
|------------|-----|--------|
| Low-NA | 0.33 | Production |
| High-NA | 0.55 | Shipping (EXE:5000, EXE:5200B) |
| Hyper-NA | 0.75+? | R&D (~2032) |

Won Reinhard von Koenig Prize (2024) jointly with ASML for High-NA development.

## Geopolitical significance

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| German location | Subject to EU/US export controls |
| Single source | Global chip supply depends on one facility |
| China access | Cannot supply EUV optics to China |

Oberkochen facility is a critical chokepoint for global semiconductor manufacturing.
