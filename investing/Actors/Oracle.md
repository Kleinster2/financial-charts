# Oracle (ORCL)

Tier 2 AI hyperscaler building out OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) for AI workloads.

---

## AI strategy

- **Cloud**: OCI competing with AWS/Azure/GCP for AI workloads
- **Partnership**: Deep NVIDIA relationship for cloud GPUs
- **Enterprise**: Targeting enterprise AI adoption
- **Infrastructure**: xAI Colossus reportedly built on Oracle Cloud

---

## Why it matters for this vault

- Another source of GPU demand flowing to [[NVIDIA]] → [[TSMC]]
- xAI connection makes Oracle part of the Musk ecosystem
- Smaller than big 4 but growing AI capex rapidly

## Chip sourcing

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| GPUs | [[NVIDIA]] ([[TSMC]]) |
| Custom silicon | None announced |
| [[Samsung]] exposure | Low |

Unlike Google/Amazon/Meta, Oracle hasn't announced custom AI chip efforts — they're a pure NVIDIA customer for now.

---

## xAI connection

xAI's Colossus data center reportedly uses Oracle Cloud infrastructure. This ties Oracle into the Musk ecosystem alongside [[Samsung]] Taylor.

Flow: `Oracle (infra) + NVIDIA (chips via TSMC) → xAI (training)`

---

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

**Neutral**: Oracle's demand flows entirely through NVIDIA to TSMC. No Samsung exposure, no custom chip diversification announced.
