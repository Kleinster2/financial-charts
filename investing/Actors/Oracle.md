#actor #hyperscaler #cloud #usa

**Oracle** — Tier 2 AI hyperscaler. [[Project Stargate]] partner, OCI for AI workloads, [[Larry Ellison]]'s nuclear DC vision.

---

## Why Oracle matters

Oracle is punching above its weight in AI infrastructure:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Stargate partner | JV with SoftBank, OpenAI, [[MGX]] |
| xAI relationship | Colossus built on OCI |
| Nuclear ambition | [[Larry Ellison]] pursuing nuclear-powered DCs |
| Cloud growth | OCI fastest-growing major cloud |

---

## Project Stargate (Jan 2025)

**JV partner in $500B AI infrastructure initiative:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | Cloud infrastructure partner |
| Partners | [[SoftBank]], [[OpenAI]], [[MGX]] |
| Contribution | Data center expertise, OCI |
| Location | Texas (initial) |

**[[Larry Ellison]]** personally involved in Stargate announcement.

See [[Project Stargate]] for full details.

---

## xAI / Colossus connection

**Musk ecosystem integration:**

| Project | Oracle role |
|---------|-------------|
| Colossus (Memphis) | OCI infrastructure |
| xAI training | Cloud compute |
| [[Grok]] models | Training infrastructure |

Oracle tied into Musk's AI ambitions via xAI.

---

## Nuclear data center vision

**[[Larry Ellison]] pursuing nuclear-powered DCs:**

| Status | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Permits | Applied for nuclear DC permits |
| Rationale | Baseload power for AI |
| SMR interest | Small modular reactors |
| Timeline | Multi-year development |

Part of [[BYOP]] trend — hyperscalers securing their own power.

See [[Nuclear power for AI]] for context.

---

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

**Fastest-growing major cloud:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cloud revenue | ~$20B/year |
| Growth rate | 25%+ |
| Market position | \#4 (behind AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| AI focus | NVIDIA GPU clusters |

**Differentiation:**
- Aggressive NVIDIA partnership
- Competitive pricing vs AWS/Azure
- Enterprise database integration
- xAI/Stargate validation

---

## AI strategy

**Pure NVIDIA customer:**

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| GPUs | [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200/Blackwell |
| Networking | NVIDIA/[[Broadcom]] |
| Custom silicon | None announced |

Unlike [[Google]]/[[Amazon]]/[[Meta]], Oracle hasn't announced custom AI chips — relies entirely on NVIDIA.

---

## TikTok infrastructure partnership (Jan 2026)

Oracle became [[TikTok]]'s "trusted technology partner" in the US restructuring:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Oracle equity stake | **~15%** of TikTok USDS JV |
| Role | Data custodian, algorithm replication, security |
| US users hosted | **170M+** on OCI |
| [[ByteDance]] retained | 19.9% stake |
| US investor total | 80.1% |

Oracle controls algorithm retraining under US jurisdiction and manages all data audits. This makes OCI the infrastructure backbone of America's most-used social app.

**Connection to Ellison IP thesis:** The same [[ByteDance]] whose [[Seedance]] 2.0 generates Hollywood-quality AI video from American IP now runs its US operations on Oracle infrastructure. See [[Ellison AI-IP vertical integration]].

---

## [[Larry Ellison]]

**Founder/CTO driving AI strategy:**
- Still active at 80+
- Close to Musk (xAI relationship)
- Vocal about AI infrastructure needs
- Personally pursuing nuclear permits
- Backing son [[David Ellison]]'s $108B hostile bid for [[Warner Bros Discovery]]

---

## TCJA repatriation (2018)

Oracle repatriated ~$35B under the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] one-time tax holiday. Deployed into aggressive M&A spree.

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ORCL (NYSE) |
| Market cap | ~$500B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$55B |
| Cloud revenue | ~$20B |
| AI capex | $10B+ (accelerating) |
| P/E | ~40x |

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Stargate = massive validation
- xAI relationship = Musk ecosystem
- OCI growing faster than competitors
- Nuclear vision = long-term power moat

**Bear case:**
- Smaller than AWS/Azure/GCP
- No custom silicon (NVIDIA dependent)
- Larry succession risk
- Stargate execution uncertain

---

## Reported layoffs (Feb 2026)

**Oracle reportedly planning 20,000-30,000 layoffs to fund AI data center expansion.**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Layoff range | 20K-30K employees |
| Rationale | Fund AI DC expansion |
| Status | Reported, not confirmed |

Context: Part of broader AI infrastructure pivot — redirecting headcount costs to capex.

## [[Guggenheim Partners]] "decade stock" thesis (Jan 2026)

**John DiFucci's $400 price target** — 118% upside from $183 (Barron's, Jan 20, 2026):

| Metric | DiFucci estimate |
|--------|------------------|
| 5-year capex need | ~$290B |
| New borrowing by FY28 | ~$112B |
| Total debt (post-raise) | >$200B |
| FY30 revenue target | $166B |
| Price target | $400 |

**The capital math:**
- $290B capex over 5 years to hit $166B revenue by 2030
- ~$112B in new borrowing needed by FY28
- Could issue equity instead (Ellison owns 41%, would dilute if value-accretive)
- "Bring your own chip" deals — customers provide GPUs, cuts capex 45-65%

**Why it works (per DiFucci):**
- "Better mousetrap" — OCI built on AWS lessons
- Enterprise-grade scaling/security "like no others can today"
- "Hyper rate" growth, "waterfall" cash flows

**OpenAI risk framing:**
- OpenAI has $1.4T in commitments vs ~$13B annual revenue
- But backstopped: [[Microsoft]] (27% stake, $135B), [[AMD]] chips-for-equity, potential Nvidia investment up to $100B
- DiFucci: "With this risk comes significant opportunity"

**Timeline:** "Decade stock" but numbers should be "irrefutable" in 5 years, "obvious long before that."

*Stock lost ~$400B market cap in 4 months to Jan 2026. DiFucci sees this as entry point for long-horizon investors.*

---

## Debt profile

~$133B pro forma face value (Feb 2026) — **largest non-financial IG issuer**. Rated BBB/Baa2 with negative outlooks (two notches above junk). $57B issued in 18 months (Sep 2024-Feb 2026) for AI infrastructure. Cash-flow negative at operating/capex level. See [[Oracle bonds]] for full inventory.

*Notable: Revenue growing 28% but EPS only 8% in FY27 — margin compression from AI infrastructure buildout. Q3 FY18 and Q2 FY22 net income excluded (one-time charges distort scale).*
