**Oracle** — Tier 2 AI hyperscaler. [[Project Stargate]] partner, OCI for AI workloads, Larry Ellison's nuclear DC vision.

---

## Why Oracle matters

Oracle is punching above its weight in AI infrastructure:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Stargate partner | JV with SoftBank, OpenAI, MGX |
| xAI relationship | Colossus built on OCI |
| Nuclear ambition | Larry Ellison pursuing nuclear-powered DCs |
| Cloud growth | OCI fastest-growing major cloud |

---

## Project Stargate (Jan 2025)

**JV partner in $500B AI infrastructure initiative:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Role | Cloud infrastructure partner |
| Partners | [[SoftBank]], [[OpenAI]], MGX |
| Contribution | Data center expertise, OCI |
| Location | Texas (initial) |

**Larry Ellison** personally involved in Stargate announcement.

See [[Project Stargate]] for full details.

## xAI / Colossus connection

**Musk ecosystem integration:**

| Project | Oracle role |
|---------|-------------|
| Colossus (Memphis) | OCI infrastructure |
| xAI training | Cloud compute |
| Grok models | Training infrastructure |

Oracle tied into Musk's AI ambitions via xAI.

## Nuclear data center vision

**Larry Ellison pursuing nuclear-powered DCs:**

| Status | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Permits | Applied for nuclear DC permits |
| Rationale | Baseload power for AI |
| SMR interest | Small modular reactors |
| Timeline | Multi-year development |

Part of [[BYOP]] trend — hyperscalers securing their own power.

See [[Nuclear power for AI]] for context.

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

**Fastest-growing major cloud:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cloud revenue | ~$20B/year |
| Growth rate | 25%+ |
| Market position | #4 (behind AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| AI focus | NVIDIA GPU clusters |

**Differentiation:**
- Aggressive NVIDIA partnership
- Competitive pricing vs AWS/Azure
- Enterprise database integration
- xAI/Stargate validation

---

## AI strategy

**Pure NVIDIA customer:**

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| GPUs | [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200/Blackwell |
| Networking | NVIDIA/Broadcom |
| Custom silicon | None announced |

Unlike Google/Amazon/Meta, Oracle hasn't announced custom AI chips — relies entirely on NVIDIA.

## Larry Ellison

**Founder/CTO driving AI strategy:**
- Still active at 80+
- Close to Musk (xAI relationship)
- Vocal about AI infrastructure needs
- Personally pursuing nuclear permits

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ORCL (NYSE) |
| Market cap | ~$500B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$55B |
| Cloud revenue | ~$20B |
| AI capex | $10B+ (accelerating) |
| P/E | ~40x |

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Stargate = massive validation
- xAI relationship = Musk ecosystem
- OCI growing faster than competitors
- Nuclear vision = long-term power moat

**Bear case:**
- Smaller than AWS/Azure/GCP
- No custom silicon (NVIDIA dependent)
- Larry succession risk
- Stargate execution uncertain
