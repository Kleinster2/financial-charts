## What makes CFTC, CFTC

**The "other" financial regulator.** While the [[SEC]] gets headlines for securities, the CFTC quietly regulates the much larger derivatives market — futures, options, swaps totaling hundreds of trillions in notional value.

**Historical roots:** Started regulating agricultural commodity futures (wheat, corn, cotton) in 1974. Expanded to energy, metals, then financial derivatives. Post-2008 Dodd-Frank gave CFTC authority over swaps — previously unregulated OTC market.

**Why it matters now:**
1. **Crypto** — Spot crypto is a "commodity" under CFTC view (not a security)
2. **Prediction markets** — Event contracts are derivatives, CFTC jurisdiction
3. **SEC turf war** — Which agency regulates digital assets?

## Jurisdiction

| Asset class | CFTC role |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Commodity futures** | Primary regulator |
| **Options on futures** | Primary regulator |
| **Swaps** | Primary regulator (post-2008) |
| **Spot commodities** | Fraud/manipulation only (not registration) |
| **Crypto (spot)** | Claims jurisdiction as commodity |
| **Event contracts** | Primary regulator ([[Kalshi]], [[Crypto.com]]) |

**Key distinction:** CFTC regulates derivatives, not the underlying commodity. Spot Bitcoin = commodity, but CFTC only has limited enforcement (fraud), not registration authority. That's the gap Congress is trying to fill.

## SEC-CFTC coordination (2026)

**Joint harmonization event (Jan 29, 2026):**
- Selig and [[Paul Atkins]] presented unified crypto approach
- "Commonsense crypto asset taxonomy" — digital commodities vs securities
- Goal: End regulatory uncertainty that drove enforcement actions

**Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act:**
- Senate Ag Committee passed (12-11 party line, Jan 29, 2026)
- Would give CFTC spot market authority over digital commodities
- First crypto market structure bill to pass a Senate committee

## Enforcement actions (crypto/prediction markets)

| Date | Target | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2022 | [[Polymarket]] | $1.4M settlement — unregistered trading |
| 2024 | Binance | $4.3B settlement — derivatives violations |
| 2024 | Various DeFi | Multiple enforcement actions |

Under Selig: shift from "regulation by enforcement" to clear rulemaking.
