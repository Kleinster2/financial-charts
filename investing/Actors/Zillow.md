| Metric | 2025 | 2026E |
|--------|------|-------|
| Home value growth | Flat | +1.2% |

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Zillow** | #1 traffic, consumer brand |
| [[CoStar Group]] (Homes.com) | #2 traffic, aggressive growth |
| Realtor.com (News Corp) | NAR partnership |
| Redfin | Now part of [[Rocket Companies]] |

**Threat:** CoStar's Homes.com grew to #2 with 111M monthly visitors.

## iBuying exit (2021)

| What happened | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Zillow Offers shut down | $500M+ write-down |
| Algorithmic buying failed | Couldn't price homes accurately |
| 25% workforce reduction | Refocused on core |

**Lesson:** Technology couldn't solve home pricing variability.

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Dominant consumer brand (#1 traffic)
- Housing recovery = more transactions
- Mortgage business growing
- Rental marketplace expansion

**Bear case:**
- CoStar/Homes.com competitive threat
- Agent commission pressure (NAR settlement)
