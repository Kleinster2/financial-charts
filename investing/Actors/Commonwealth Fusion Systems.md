**Commonwealth Fusion Systems** — MIT spinout fusion company. SPARC tokamak design. Most-funded private fusion company. Targeting 2030s commercial power.

## Why CFS matters

CFS is the most credible private fusion effort:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2018 (MIT spinout) |
| Funding | $2B+ raised |
| Design | SPARC tokamak |
| HQ | Devens, Massachusetts |
| [[Target]] | 2030s commercial |

---

## Technology: High-field tokamak

| Innovation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Magnets | High-temperature superconducting (HTS) |
| Field strength | 20 [[Tesla]] (vs ~12T conventional) |
| Size | Smaller than ITER |
| Advantage | Compact, faster to build |

**Key breakthrough**: HTS magnets enable smaller, cheaper tokamaks. CFS demonstrated 20T magnet in 2021.

## SPARC reactor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Demonstration tokamak |
| Goal | Net energy gain (Q>2) |
| Location | Devens, MA |
| Timeline | Mid-2020s operation |
| Purpose | Prove physics before commercial |

SPARC is the proof step before ARC (commercial design).

---

## ARC commercial reactor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Commercial power plant |
| Output | ~400 MW electric |
| Timeline | 2030s |
| Goal | Cost-competitive with fission |

If SPARC works, ARC follows.

## Cap table / Investors

| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| Series A | 2018 | $50M | — |
| Series B | 2021 | $1.8B | $5B+ |
| Additional | 2024 | $200M+ | — |
| **Total** | | **$2B+** | |

**Key investors:**

| Investor | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| [[Tiger Global]] | Lead (Series B) |
| [[Bill Gates]] / Breakthrough Energy | Strategic |
| [[Google]] | Strategic |
| [[Khosla Ventures]] | Early backer |
| Emerson Collective | Growth |
| [[Temasek]] | Sovereign |

**Total raised:** $2B+

**Most-funded private fusion company globally.**

## Fusion vs Fission for AI

| Aspect | Fusion (CFS) | Fission (SMRs) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Timeline | 2030s+ | Late 2020s |
| Technical risk | High | Lower |
| AI relevance | Too late | Near-term |
| Fuel | Abundant | [[Uranium]] supply chain |

**Reality**: Fusion won't power AI data centers this decade. It's a 2030s+ bet.

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Private |
| Total raised | $2B+ |
| Key investors | [[Tiger Global]], [[Bill Gates]], Google, Khosla |
| Valuation | $5B+ (estimated) |
| Revenue | $0 (pre-commercial) |
| SPARC target | Mid-2020s |
| Commercial | 2030s |

**Most-funded private fusion company globally.**

## Investment angle

**Bull:**
- Most credible fusion approach
- $2B+ war chest
- MIT pedigree
- HTS magnet breakthrough proven

**Bear:**
- Private (can't invest directly)
- Fusion always "20 years away"
- Technical risk remains
- Too late for near-term AI power
