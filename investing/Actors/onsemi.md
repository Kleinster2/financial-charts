## SiC strategy

**Silicon Carbide for EVs:**

| Factor | onsemi position |
|--------|-----------------|
| Vertical integration | Substrate → device |
| El Segundo fab | 150mm SiC capacity |
| Czech Republic fab | 200mm SiC (ramping) |
| EV customers | VW, Mercedes, Hyundai |
| Competition | STMicro, Infineon, Wolfspeed |

**SiC advantage:** Higher efficiency than silicon IGBTs for EV inverters (800V systems).

**SiC market dynamics:**
- onsemi \#2-3 behind STMicro in auto SiC
- Targeting $1B+ SiC revenue by 2024
- Long-term supply agreements (LTSAs) lock in customers
- 200mm transition critical for cost competitiveness

## Image sensor strength

**Automotive ADAS:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market position | \#1 automotive image sensors |
| Global share | ~50% of auto image sensors |
| Key product | AR0820 (8MP, ADAS-grade) |
| Customers | Tesla, Mobileye, Tier 1s |

Camera content per vehicle rising with L2+ ADAS adoption.

## End markets

| Market | Exposure | Trend |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Automotive | ~55% | EV/ADAS growth |
| Industrial | ~25% | Automation |
| Other | ~20% | Consumer, computing |

Automotive dominant = high cyclicality.

## Manufacturing footprint

| Facility | Products | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| South Portland, ME | Power discretes | Legacy fab |
| El Segundo, CA | SiC | 150mm capacity |
| Czech Republic | SiC | 200mm expansion |
| Korea (SK Siltron) | SiC substrates | $450M acquisition (2021) |

**Vertical integration:** Only power semi with captive SiC substrate supply (SK Siltron CSS acquisition).

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus | vs onsemi |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| [[STMicro]] | SiC leader, Tesla supplier | Ahead in SiC scale |
| [[Infineon]] | Power broad, \#1 auto | Larger, less SiC focus |
| Wolfspeed | Pure-play SiC | Better substrates, worse financials |
| [[Texas Instruments]] | Analog broad | Different focus |
| [[Analog Devices]] | Mixed-signal | Different focus |

## Recent challenges

**2024-2025 headwinds:**
- EV adoption slowdown in US/Europe
- SiC oversupply concerns
- Inventory destocking at customers
- China competition intensifying
- TTM net income down 82% (restructuring charges)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- SiC growth with EV adoption (long-term)
- Image sensor moat (\#1 position)
- Vertical integration advantage
- CHIPS Act beneficiary
- LTSAs provide revenue visibility

**Bear:**
- EV adoption slower than expected
- SiC competition intensifying (STMicro, China)
- Inventory correction ongoing
- Customer concentration risk
- Cyclical downturn
