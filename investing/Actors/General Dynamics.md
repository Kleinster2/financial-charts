## Trump defense policy (Jan 2026)

### Budget ($1.5T) — Jan 7

Stock rallied with peers on $1.5T budget announcement. Submarine programs are "must fund."

### Executive order — Jan 8

Stock fell **-4.2%**, giving back gains.

| Restriction | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Dividend ban | Until production investment |
| Buyback ban | Programs paused |
| Exec pay cap | $5M max |

**Shipbuilding cited:** Trump's order mentioned "slow naval shipbuilding timelines." Virginia-class and Columbia-class behind schedule.

See [[Trump defense budget]] for full context.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Columbia-class is "no fail" program (\#1 DoD priority)

- Gulfstream business jet cycle
- $90B+ backlog visibility

**Bear:**
- **Executive order restrictions** (Jan 2026)
- Shipbuilding execution risk
- Less AI/autonomy exposure than peers
- Business jet cyclicality
