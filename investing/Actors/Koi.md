## What Koi does

Secures the "agentic endpoint" — AI agents and autonomous tools that operate with deep data access and unrestricted permissions but bypass traditional security controls.

Core product: Replaces download buttons with approval workflows; evaluates file/developer risk before allowing execution.

Problem: Traditional security was built to stop malicious files. AI agents can actively read, write, and move data. Attackers chain exploits in agent frameworks — authentication bypass, API-based RCE, spoofed agent identities, credential hijacking.
