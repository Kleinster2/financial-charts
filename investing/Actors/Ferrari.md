## The scarcity model

| Lever | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **Production cap** | ~14,000 units/year (vs. Porsche 300,000+) |
| **Waiting lists** | 2-3 years for most models |
| **Personalization** | Atelier customization = higher ASP |
| **Limited editions** | €2M+ hypercars (LaFerrari, Daytona SP3) |
| **Client vetting** | Must own previous Ferraris for top models |

**The anti-volume strategy:** Ferrari could sell more cars but deliberately doesn't. Scarcity = pricing power = margin.

---

## Revenue mix

| Segment | % Revenue | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Cars & spare parts | ~85% | Core business |
| Sponsorship/commercial | ~10% | F1, licensing |
| Engines | ~5% | Maserati supply (ending) |

---

## Product portfolio (2024)

| Model | Type | Price range |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Roma | GT | ~€220,000 |
| 296 GTB/GTS | V6 hybrid | ~€270,000 |
| SF90 | PHEV supercar | ~€500,000 |
| Purosangue | SUV | ~€400,000 |
| 812 successor | V12 | ~€400,000+ |
| Daytona SP3 | Hypercar | €2M+ |

**Purosangue** (2023) — Ferrari's first SUV, controversial but sold out. Not called "SUV" (Ferrari calls it "four-door, four-seater").

---

## [[EV transition]]

| [[Target]] | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| First full EV | **2025** (confirmed) |
| EV % of sales (2030) | ~40% hybrid, ~5% BEV |
| ICE | Will continue "as long as permitted" |

**The Vigna approach:** CEO Benedetto Vigna (ex-STMicroelectronics) hired specifically for semiconductor/EV expertise. Building €200M e-building at Maranello.

**The sound problem:** Ferrari's V8/V12 engine sounds are core to brand identity. How to replicate emotionally in EV?

---

## Ownership

| Shareholder | Stake |
|-------------|-------|
| [[Exor]] (Agnelli) | 24% |
| Piero Ferrari | 10% |
| Public | ~66% |

Spun off from Fiat-Chrysler in 2015-2016. John Elkann (Exor chairman) is Ferrari chairman.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Luxury valuation justified — not a car company
- 30%+ margins, growing
- Scarcity model = permanent pricing power
- Purosangue expands TAM without diluting brand
- Waiting lists = visibility
- [[EV transition]] managed carefully

**Bear:**
- 40x PE — priced for perfection
- EV Ferrari may not resonate emotionally
- [[China]] luxury slowdown (small but growing market)
- Regulation could force volume ([[EU]] emissions)
- Key-man risk (brand mystique is fragile)
