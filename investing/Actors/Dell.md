## Why Dell matters for this vault

![[dell-vs-peers.png]]
*Dell +150% since 2019 re-IPO — underperformed [[Nasdaq|QQQ]] (+200%). AI server demand offset by PC downturn and memory cost squeeze.*

*vs [[Nasdaq|QQQ]]*

Dell is a major memory buyer feeling the squeeze:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Business | PCs, servers, storage |
| Memory exposure | High % of BOM |
| Response | Double-digit price hikes planned |
| Quote | "Never witnessed costs escalating at current pace" |

---

## Memory cost impact

COO Jeff Clarke (Nov 2025):
> "Never witnessed costs escalating at the current pace."

Response:
- Planning double-digit PC price increases
- Server costs also rising
- Passing costs to customers

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Memory exposure |
|---------|-----------------|
| Client (PCs) | High — DRAM, SSD in every unit |
| ISG (Servers) | Very high — servers memory-dense |
| Storage | High — NAND-based |

Dell is a price taker on memory — no leverage.

## Financials

### Annual (10 years, fiscal year ends Jan)

| FY | Revenue | Net Income | EPS | Stock Price |
|----|---------|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2016 | $50.9B | $1.6B | $— | — |
| 2017 | $61.6B | -$1.7B | $— | — |
| 2018 | $78.7B | -$2.3B | $— | — |
| 2019 | $90.6B | $2.3B | $— | $46 |
| 2020 | $92.2B | $4.6B | $6.03 | $45 |
| 2021 | $94.2B | $3.3B | $4.45 | $86 |
| 2022 | $101.2B | $5.6B | $7.13 | $53 |
| 2023 | $102.3B | $2.4B | $3.24 | $40 |
| 2024 | $88.4B | $3.4B | $4.36 | $79 |
| 2025 | $95.6B | $4.6B | $6.50 | $115 |

*Source: Company filings. Stock price = fiscal year-end close (Jan). Dell re-IPO'd 2018; pre-2019 EPS not comparable. FY2023-24 dip from PC downturn.*

![[dell-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue grew from ~$14B/Q (2015) to ~$25B/Q (2025). EMC acquisition (2016) drove the step-up. Net income volatile: loss in 2016-17 (EMC integration), profit spikes 2019-21 ([[VMware]] gains), normalizing ~$1-2B/Q now.*

## AI server opportunity

Offsetting factor:
- Dell sells AI servers (NVIDIA-based)
- AI infrastructure demand strong
- Higher ASPs on AI systems
- But memory costs hit here too

Mixed picture: AI demand helps revenue, memory costs hurt margins.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Situation |
|------------|-----------|
| Dell | Raising prices, absorbing some cost |
| [[Lenovo]] | Hoarding inventory, same squeeze |
| HP | Warning of H2 2026 price hikes |

All PC OEMs in same boat.

---

## Why OEMs are less hurt than small vendors

Scale advantages:
- Lock in orders early
- Volume commitments with memory makers
- Less exposed to spot pricing
- But still feeling pain

Smaller vendors (see [[Corsair]]) hit harder.

---

## Investment case

Bear:
- Memory costs compressing margins
- PC demand soft
- Cost pass-through risks demand

Bull:
- AI server demand strong
- Can pass costs to enterprise
- Scale advantages vs smaller players
- Memory normalizes eventually
