**Dell** — PC/server OEM. "Never witnessed costs escalating at current pace." Memory squeeze hitting margins.

## Why Dell matters for this vault

![[dell-vs-peers.png]]
*Dell +150% since 2019 re-IPO — underperformed [[Nasdaq|QQQ]] (+200%). AI server demand offset by PC downturn and memory cost squeeze.*

*vs [[Nasdaq|QQQ]]*

Dell is a major memory buyer feeling the squeeze:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Business | PCs, servers, storage |
| Memory exposure | High % of BOM |
| Response | Double-digit price hikes planned |
| Quote | "Never witnessed costs escalating at current pace" |

## Memory cost impact

**COO Jeff Clarke (Nov 2025):**
> "Never witnessed costs escalating at the current pace."

**Response:**
- Planning double-digit PC price increases
- Server costs also rising
- Passing costs to customers

## Business segments

| Segment | Memory exposure |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Client (PCs)** | High — DRAM, SSD in every unit |
| **ISG (Servers)** | Very high — servers memory-dense |
| **Storage** | High — NAND-based |

Dell is a price taker on memory — no leverage.

## AI server opportunity

**Offsetting factor:**
- Dell sells AI servers (NVIDIA-based)
- AI infrastructure demand strong
- Higher ASPs on AI systems
- But memory costs hit here too

**Mixed picture:** AI demand helps revenue, memory costs hurt margins.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Situation |
|------------|-----------|
| **Dell** | Raising prices, absorbing some cost |
| [[Lenovo]] | Hoarding inventory, same squeeze |
| HP | Warning of H2 2026 price hikes |

All PC OEMs in same boat.

## Why OEMs are less hurt than small vendors

**Scale advantages:**
- Lock in orders early
- Volume commitments with memory makers
- Less exposed to spot pricing
- But still feeling pain

Smaller vendors (see [[Corsair]]) hit harder.

---

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- Memory costs compressing margins
- PC demand soft
- Cost pass-through risks demand

**Bull:**
- AI server demand strong
- Can pass costs to enterprise
- Scale advantages vs smaller players
- Memory normalizes eventually

| Metric | Value |
