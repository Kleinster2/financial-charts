## Why Dell matters for this vault

![[dell-vs-peers.png]]
*Dell +150% since 2019 re-IPO — underperformed [[Nasdaq|QQQ]] (+200%). AI server demand offset by PC downturn and memory cost squeeze.*

*vs [[Nasdaq|QQQ]]*

Dell is a major memory buyer feeling the squeeze:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Business | PCs, servers, storage |
| Memory exposure | High % of BOM |
| Response | Double-digit price hikes planned |
| Quote | "Never witnessed costs escalating at current pace" |

---

## Memory cost impact

**COO Jeff Clarke (Nov 2025):**
> "Never witnessed costs escalating at the current pace."

**Response:**
- Planning double-digit PC price increases
- Server costs also rising
- Passing costs to customers

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Memory exposure |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Client (PCs)** | High — DRAM, SSD in every unit |
| **ISG (Servers)** | Very high — servers memory-dense |
| **Storage** | High — NAND-based |

Dell is a price taker on memory — no leverage.

### Annual (10 years, fiscal year ends Jan)

| FY | Revenue | Net Income | EPS | Stock Price |

| 2025 | $95.6B | $4.6B | $6.50 | $115 |

*Source: Company filings. Stock price = fiscal year-end close (Jan). Dell re-IPO'd 2018; pre-2019 EPS not comparable. FY2023-24 dip from PC downturn.*

![[dell-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue grew from ~$14B/Q (2015) to ~$25B/Q (2025). EMC acquisition (2016) drove the step-up. Net income volatile: loss in 2016-17 (EMC integration), profit spikes 2019-21 ([[VMware]] gains), normalizing ~$1-2B/Q now.*

## AI server opportunity

**Offsetting factor:**
- Dell sells AI servers (NVIDIA-based)
- AI infrastructure demand strong
- Higher ASPs on AI systems
- But memory costs hit here too

**Mixed picture:** AI demand helps revenue, memory costs hurt margins.

---

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Situation |
|------------|-----------|
| **Dell** | Raising prices, absorbing some cost |
| [[Lenovo]] | Hoarding inventory, same squeeze |
| HP | Warning of H2 2026 price hikes |

All PC OEMs in same boat.

---

## Why OEMs are less hurt than small vendors

**Scale advantages:**
- Lock in orders early
- Volume commitments with memory makers
- Less exposed to spot pricing
- But still feeling pain

Smaller vendors (see [[Corsair]]) hit harder.

---

## Investment case

**Bear:**
- Memory costs compressing margins
- PC demand soft
- Cost pass-through risks demand

**Bull:**
- AI server demand strong
- Can pass costs to enterprise
- Scale advantages vs smaller players
- Memory normalizes eventually
