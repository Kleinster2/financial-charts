Co-founder of [[Anthropic]]. Lead author of the GPT-3 paper ("Language Models are Few-Shot Learners," 2020) — the paper that proved scaling large language models produced emergent capabilities and launched the modern AI era. Left [[OpenAI]] in early 2021 with six colleagues including [[Dario Amodei]] and [[Daniela Amodei]] over disagreements about safety prioritization. Still at Anthropic as of February 2026.
