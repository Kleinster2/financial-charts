## Why Merck KGaA matters

The largest non-Japanese player in advanced semiconductor materials:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MRK.DE (Frankfurt) |
| Market cap | ~€55B (~$60B) |
| 2024 revenue | €21.2B |
| Semiconductor Solutions | €2.6B (+7.8% organic) |
| Electronics % of group | 18% of sales, 15% of EBITDA |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | 2024 Revenue | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Healthcare** | ~€8.5B | Oncology, neurology, fertility |
| **Life Science** | ~€8.5B | Lab equipment, biopharma |
| **Electronics** | ~€4.2B | Semiconductor + display materials |

Electronics includes Semiconductor Solutions (€2.6B) and Display Solutions/Optronics.

## Semiconductor Solutions breakdown

| Business field | Products |
|----------------|----------|
| **Patterning** | Photoresists, anti-reflective coatings, DSA |
| **Planarization** | CMP slurries |
| **Thin Films** | Deposition materials |
| **Specialty Gases** | Etch gases, low-GWP alternatives |

**2024 performance:** Semiconductor Solutions +7.8% organic growth, driven by AI chip demand for high-value materials.

## Investment and strategy

**€3B+ investment by 2025:**
- Low-GWP (global warming potential) etch gases
- Non-PFAS photoresists
- Directed self-assembly (DSA) technologies

**Taiwan megasite:**
- Kaohsiung facility inaugurated
- Supports local semiconductor ecosystem
- Positions for TSMC supply chain

**Unity-SC acquisition:**
- High-precision metrology instruments
- Quality and yield improvement tools

## Competitive position

| Company | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | #1, private |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | #2, Japan |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | #3, Japan |
| **Merck KGaA** | Largest non-Japanese |
| [[DuPont]] / [[Qnity]] | US player |

Merck KGaA competes across the full semiconductor materials stack, not just photoresists.

## Q1 2025 performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Semi Solutions revenue | €649M (+2.0% organic) |
| Driver | AI-driven demand for advanced node materials |
| Thin Films | Record sales (AI applications) |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Diversified semiconductor materials portfolio (not just resists)
- Non-Japanese alternative for supply chain diversification
- AI demand driving advanced node materials
- Strong R&D pipeline (DSA, low-GWP gases)
- Healthcare provides stability

**Bear:**
- Photoresists are small vs Japanese leaders
- Conglomerate structure (healthcare, life science dominate)
- Euro/USD exposure
- Healthcare segment competitive pressures
- Electronics only 18% of business

---

## Note on naming

**Merck KGaA** (Germany, MRK.DE) is NOT the same as **Merck & Co** (US, MRK):
- Split in 1917 (WWI)
- Merck KGaA owns "Merck" name outside US/Canada
- Uses "EMD" brand in North America
- Completely separate companies, no common ownership
