| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $55B |
| Expense ratio | 0.08% |
| Holdings | 76 |
| P/E | 16.5x |
| Yield | 1.3% |
| Inception | Dec 1998 |

## Composition

Banks, insurance, capital markets, consumer finance, mortgage REITs. Mix of:
- **Megabanks:** [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Bank of America]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Citigroup]]
- **Investment banks:** [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]]
- **Insurance:** [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Progressive]], [[MetLife]]
- **Cards/payments:** [[Visa]], [[Mastercard]], [[American Express]]
- **Asset managers:** [[BlackRock]], [[Charles Schwab]]

## Top Holdings

| Company | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| [[Berkshire Hathaway]] | ~13% |
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | ~11% |
| [[Visa]] | ~8% |
| [[Mastercard]] | ~6% |
| [[Bank of America]] | ~4% |

Berkshire dominates because of its massive market cap. Payments ([[Visa]], [[Mastercard]]) are big weights — not just banks.

## Use Case

Primary US financials benchmark. When charting [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Bank of America]], include XLF for sector context.

**Regional banks:** Use [[KRE]] instead — XLF is dominated by megacaps, won't reflect regional bank dynamics.

**European banks:** Use [[EUFN]] for European comparisons.
