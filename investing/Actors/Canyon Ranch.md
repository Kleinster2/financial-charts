## Investment case

Bull:
- Pioneer brand with 46 years of wellness credibility — hard to replicate
- $6.8T global wellness economy; wellness tourism growing 16%/year
- Goff's track record (Crescent: $500M → $6.5B) applied to wellness
- VICI Properties partnership provides non-dilutive growth capital
- Urban wellness clubs (~15 planned) = recurring revenue at lower capex than destination resorts
- Branded residences create real estate monetization beyond hospitality
- Austin resort ($500M) is a category-defining bet on women's wellness

Bear:
- Private — no financial transparency
- High capex model (destination resorts are capital-intensive)
- Luxury wellness is discretionary — recession-vulnerable
- CEO turnover (multiple transitions since Goff acquisition)
- Geographic concentration shifting to Texas under Goff
- Competition intensifying — Hyatt/Miraval, IHG/Six Senses, Aman all scaling wellness
