## Why it matters

HFR is the source for most hedge fund industry statistics cited in financial media:

- **$5.15T AUM** (record, Q4 2025)
- **$116B net inflows** (2025, most since 2007)
- **12.5% average return** (2025, best in 16 years)

When Bloomberg, WSJ, or institutional research cites "hedge fund industry" figures, it's usually HFR data.
