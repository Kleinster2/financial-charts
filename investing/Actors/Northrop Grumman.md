## Trump defense policy (Jan 2026)

### Budget ($1.5T) — Jan 7

Stock jumped **+6.8%** — largest gainer among primes.

| Current (FY26) | Proposed (FY27) | Change |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| $901B | $1.5T | +66% |

**Why Northrop jumped most:** B-21 and GBSD are crown jewels of nuclear modernization.

### Executive order — Jan 8

Stock fell **-5.5%** — largest decliner among primes.

| Restriction | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
