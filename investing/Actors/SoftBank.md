| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Stargate lead | $100B+ initial, $500B total commitment |
| Arm ownership | ~90% of mobile CPU monopoly |
| Vision Fund | $150B+ deployed |
| AI ambition | Masa targeting AGI leadership |

---

## DigitalBridge acquisition (Dec 2025)

Acquiring digital infrastructure investor to support AI ambitions:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | [[DigitalBridge]] |
| Price | $4B |
| DigitalBridge AUM | $108B |
| DC capacity | 5.4GW in development/operation |
| Expected close | H2 2026 |

Strategic rationale:
- DigitalBridge portfolio company Vantage building Stargate Wisconsin DC (~1GW)
- Need physical infrastructure to support AI ambitions

Also in talks to acquire [[Switch]]:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | Switch (DigitalBridge portfolio company) |
| Asking price | ~$50B (including debt) |
| 2022 acquisition | $11B (4.5x appreciation) |
| Flagship | Core Campus Las Vegas (495MW) |

Switch IPO alternative: If acquisition fails, Switch preparing IPO early 2026 at ~$60B valuation (including debt) — $10B higher than acquisition ask.

Bloomberg Intelligence on Stargate (Jan 2026):
> Headline $500B but actual SoftBank cash needs closer to $40B — adjusting for 40% JV stake and project financing with only 20% equity. SoftBank participation "less active than expected."

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 9984.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~$100B |
| NAV | ~$150B+ |
| Net debt | ~$40B |
| LTV ratio | ~15% |

Discount to NAV: SoftBank typically trades at 30-50% discount due to:
- Conglomerate structure
- Masa execution risk
- Vision Fund volatility

---

## Investment implications

Bull case:
- Stargate = $500B AI infrastructure play
- Arm in every AI device (phones, edge, cars)
- Discount to NAV may close
- Masa right about AGI timeline

Bear case:
- Execution risk (WeWork, etc.)
- Concentrated bets
- [[Japan]] conglomerate discount persistent
- Stargate may not deploy full $500B

## SB Energy — $33B Portsmouth gas plant (Feb 2026)

SB Energy, a SoftBank subsidiary, will operate the Portsmouth Powered Land Project — a $33B, 9.2 GW natural gas generation facility in Portsmouth, Ohio. Described as "the largest natural gas generation facility in history." Part of the $36B US-Japan deal (first tranche of Japan's $550B total commitment under the Trump trade deal).

The facility underscores SoftBank's pivot beyond tech investing into physical AI infrastructure — 9.2 GW is enough to power multiple hyperscaler data center campuses. Connects to SoftBank's broader [[Project Stargate]] ambitions.
