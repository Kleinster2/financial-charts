## DigitalBridge acquisition (Dec 2025)

**Acquiring digital infrastructure investor to support AI ambitions:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | [[DigitalBridge]] |
| Price | **$4B** |
| DigitalBridge AUM | $108B |
| DC capacity | 5.4GW in development/operation |
| Expected close | H2 2026 |

**Strategic rationale:**
- DigitalBridge portfolio company Vantage building Stargate Wisconsin DC (~1GW)
- Need physical infrastructure to support AI ambitions

**Also in talks to acquire [[Switch]]:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | Switch (DigitalBridge portfolio company) |
| Asking price | **~$50B** (including debt) |
| 2022 acquisition | $11B (4.5x appreciation) |
| Flagship | Core Campus Las Vegas (495MW) |

**Switch IPO alternative:** If acquisition fails, Switch preparing IPO early 2026 at **~$60B** valuation (including debt) — $10B higher than acquisition ask.

**Bloomberg Intelligence on Stargate (Jan 2026):**
> Headline $500B but actual SoftBank cash needs closer to **$40B** — adjusting for 40% JV stake and project financing with only 20% equity. SoftBank participation "less active than expected."

| Ticker | 9984.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~$100B |
| NAV | ~$150B+ |
