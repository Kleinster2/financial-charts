SoftBank Group — Japanese conglomerate and tech investor. Led by [[Masayoshi Son]]. Owns [[Arm Holdings]] (~90%), leads [[Project Stargate]] ($500B AI infrastructure).

Japanese tech conglomerate making the largest AI infrastructure bet in history: lead investor in Project Stargate ($500B over 4 years, $100B initial) alongside OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX. Crown jewel is ~90% ownership of Arm Holdings (~$150B+ market value). On a 2025 acquisition spree — $41B into OpenAI (~11% stake), $6.5B for Ampere Computing, $4B for DigitalBridge, $5.4B proposed for ABB robotics — funded partly by selling its entire NVIDIA stake ($5.83B). Stock nearly doubled in 2025. The bull case: Arm's mobile CPU monopoly + Stargate infrastructure + AI portfolio positions Masa as kingmaker of the AI era. The bear case: Bloomberg Intel estimates actual SoftBank cash needs closer to $40B vs $500B headline, Vision Fund track record is mixed ($150B+ deployed with volatile returns), and execution risk on simultaneous mega-deals is extreme.

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Stargate lead | $100B+ initial, $500B total commitment |
| Arm ownership | ~90% of mobile CPU monopoly |
| Vision Fund | $150B+ deployed |
| AI ambition | Masa targeting AGI leadership |

## Project Stargate (Jan 2025)

Lead investor in $500B AI infrastructure initiative:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total commitment | $500B over 4 years |
| Initial investment | $100B |
| Partners | [[OpenAI]], [[Oracle]], [[MGX]] |
| Role | Lead investor, chairman (Masa) |

## DigitalBridge acquisition (Dec 2025)

Acquiring digital infrastructure investor to support AI ambitions:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | [[DigitalBridge]] |
| Price | $4B |
| DigitalBridge AUM | $108B |
| DC capacity | 5.4GW in development/operation |
| Expected close | H2 2026 |

Strategic rationale:
- DigitalBridge portfolio company Vantage building Stargate Wisconsin DC (~1GW)
- Need physical infrastructure to support AI ambitions

Also in talks to acquire [[Switch]]:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] | Switch (DigitalBridge portfolio company) |
| Asking price | ~$50B (including debt) |
| 2022 acquisition | $11B (4.5x appreciation) |
| Flagship | Core Campus Las Vegas (495MW) |

Switch IPO alternative: If acquisition fails, Switch preparing IPO early 2026 at ~$60B valuation (including debt) — $10B higher than acquisition ask.

Bloomberg Intelligence on Stargate (Jan 2026):
> Headline $500B but actual SoftBank cash needs closer to $40B — adjusting for 40% JV stake and project financing with only 20% equity. SoftBank participation "less active than expected."

## Key holdings

| Asset | Stake | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| [[Arm Holdings]] | ~90% | ~$150B | Crown jewel |

## Masayoshi Son's AI vision

Masa believes:
- AGI coming within 10 years
- SoftBank must lead AI infrastructure buildout
- Arm + Stargate = foundation for AI future
- Willing to bet the company on AI

Risk: Concentrated bet on one man's vision.

## Q3 FY2025 results (Oct-Dec 2025, reported Feb 12 2026)

Fourth consecutive quarterly profit — first time since 2021:

| Metric | Q3 FY2025 | 9M FY2025 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Net profit | ¥248.6B ($1.62B) | ¥3.17T ($20.7B) |
| YoY | vs ¥369B loss | 5x year-ago |
| OpenAI investment gain | — | $19.8B (cumulative) |
| OpenAI stake | 11% | ~$34.6B invested |

Capital moves:
- Exited [[NVIDIA]] position entirely
- Sold [[T-Mobile]] stake: $12.7B (Jun-Dec)
- Expanded [[Arm Holdings|Arm]] margin loan: $13.5B → $20B
- Increased [[SoftBank Corp]] borrowings: ¥800B → ¥1.2T
- In talks to invest additional $30B in [[OpenAI]] at $750-830B valuation

BTIG analyst Jesse Sobelson: SoftBank is "the only real way to directly play [[OpenAI]] in today's public markets" — OpenAI represents ~30% of NAV.

US ADR (SFTBY) +3% on results.

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 9984.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~$100B |
| NAV | ~$150B+ |
| Net debt | ~$40B |
| LTV ratio | ~15% |

Discount to NAV: SoftBank typically trades at 30-50% discount due to:
- Conglomerate structure
- Masa execution risk
- Vision Fund volatility

---

## Investment implications

Bull case:
- Stargate = $500B AI infrastructure play
- Arm in every AI device (phones, edge, cars)
- Discount to NAV may close
- Masa right about AGI timeline

Bear case:
- Execution risk (WeWork, etc.)
- Concentrated bets
- [[Japan]] conglomerate discount persistent
- Stargate may not deploy full $500B

## SB Energy — $33B Portsmouth gas plant (Feb 2026)

SB Energy, a SoftBank subsidiary, will operate the Portsmouth Powered Land Project — a $33B, 9.2 GW [[Natural gas|natural gas]] generation facility in Portsmouth, Ohio. Described as "the largest natural gas generation facility in history." Part of the $36B US-Japan deal (first tranche of [[Japan]]'s $550B total commitment under the Trump trade deal).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity | 9.2 GW (largest gas plant in US, among largest in world) |
| Price tag | $33B |
| Implied cost per kW | ~$3,600 |
| CCGT avg cost (2023, BNEF) | ~$1,000/kW |
| CCGT avg cost (2025, BNEF) | ~$2,000/kW |
| Estimated LCOE | ~$75-80/MWh |
| PJM average futures | <$60/MWh |
| Transmission fees | ~$15-20/MWh |
| All-in delivered cost | ~$100/MWh |
| Comparable nuclear PPAs | ~$100/MWh |
| Carbon cost at $50/ton | +$17.50/MWh |

The $3,600/kW implied cost represents a new level in surge pricing for combined-cycle gas turbines. Turbine backlog from [[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]], and [[Mitsubishi]] has stretched to 4+ years as demand surges alongside AI electricity forecasts.

Neither [[PJM]] nor Ohio regulators were reportedly aware of the plans, adding to doubts about whether the project is real vs. political signaling.

The LCOE problem: at ~$75-80/MWh, the plant's levelized cost already exceeds prevailing [[PJM]] futures (<$60). Add transmission and the all-in cost approaches ~$100/MWh — similar to what hyperscalers have paid for nuclear PPAs in the region. Gas generation is being priced like nuclear, without nuclear's zero-carbon advantage.

US gas-fired LCOE jumped 48% in H2 2025 YoY (Bloomberg NEF). The historical cost advantage of gas over other generation technologies is eroding rapidly:

[[CreditSights]] warning (Andy DeVries): new supply commitments reported by utilities are running far ahead of consensus data center demand forecasts, especially through end of decade. Overbuild risk if AI demand disappoints.

Denning's argument: the old model of building giant power plants to meet peak demand forecasts is unsustainable — economically, environmentally, and politically. A modular approach (smaller gas plants, renewables + [[Batteries|batteries]], demand management) hedges better against demand uncertainty. When gas power is priced like nuclear, developers should focus on demand management — avoiding grid use for a handful of peak hours/year — rather than chasing peaks with expensive, underutilized capacity.
