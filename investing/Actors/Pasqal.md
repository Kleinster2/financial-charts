## Technology

**Neutral atom approach:**
- Individual atoms trapped by laser "optical tweezers"
- Atoms arranged in 2D/3D arrays
- Rydberg interactions create entanglement
- Natively suited for optimization problems

**Current systems:**
- Orion Beta — deployed at GENCI (France)
- QPUs at Jülich, CEA

**2025-2026 roadmap:**
- 250-qubit QPU optimized for quantum advantage
- Demonstration on industry-relevant problems (target: H1 2026)
- Path to digital fault-tolerant quantum computing

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Approach | vs Pasqal |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| [[Infleqtion]] | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| QuEra | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| Atom Computing | Neutral atom | Direct competitor |
| [[IBM]]/[[Google]] | Superconducting | Different physics |

**Pasqal advantage:** First to deploy in real HPC centers. Strong European government backing. Nobel founder credibility.

## Investment implications

**Private company** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Temasek]] — lead investor
- [[LG Electronics]] — strategic investor
- Watch for future funding rounds or IPO

**Watch for:**
- 250-qubit quantum advantage demonstration (H1 2026)
- Additional HPC center deployments
- Illinois facility progress
- Competition with [[Infleqtion]] (also neutral atom, also going to Illinois)
