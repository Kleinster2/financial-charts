## Business model

BM&C operates as an independent, multiplataform financial media company. Revenue likely comes from:

1. Advertising — TV, YouTube, portal display/video ads
2. Sponsorships — financial brands, brokerages, fintechs
3. Educational content — "BM&C Conteúdos e Treinamentos Online" (the legal name includes training)
4. Content licensing — integration with trading platforms (Nelogica Profit)
5. Events and partnerships

The core differentiator is editorial independence. BM&C emphasizes it is not owned by any bank, brokerage, or institution — unlike competitors:
- [[InfoMoney]] — owned by [[XP Inc]]
- Exame — owned by [[BTG Pactual]]
- InvestNews — owned by [[Banco Inter]]/[[SoftBank]]

This matters because bank-owned financial media faces inherent conflicts of interest when covering their parent company's products, competitors, or market events.

## Competitive landscape

| Outlet | Owner | Independence |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| BM&C News | Independent (BM&C S.A.) | Fully independent — no bank/brokerage ownership |
| [[InfoMoney]] | [[XP Inc]] | XP-owned — covers XP ecosystem favorably |
| Exame | [[BTG Pactual]] | BTG-owned since 2022 |
| InvestNews | [[Banco Inter]]/[[SoftBank]] | Inter-affiliated |
| Valor Econômico | [[Globo]] | Part of Globo media empire |
| Bloomberg Línea (BR) | [[Bloomberg]] | International — limited Brazil-specific depth |

BM&C's independence positioning is its moat. In a market where every major financial media outlet is owned by a bank or brokerage, being truly independent gives credibility with retail investors who are skeptical of conflicted coverage.

## Context

BM&C's rise tracks the explosion of Brazilian retail investing: from ~1M individual investors on [[B3]] in 2018 to ~20M by 2024. As Selic dropped to 2% in 2020, millions of Brazilians moved money from savings (poupança) to stocks, funds, and international investments for the first time. They needed financial media that spoke their language — literally and figuratively. BM&C filled that gap.

The channel's growth also reflects a broader trend: YouTube and social media replacing traditional TV as the primary source of financial information for retail investors. BM&C was YouTube-native from day one and later expanded to traditional TV, the reverse of how legacy media operates.
