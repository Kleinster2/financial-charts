## PCIe retimers

**What's a retimer?**
- Regenerates degraded signals
- Extends PCIe reach
- Enables longer traces, cables
- Essential for large servers

**AI server need:**
- GPUs far from CPU
- Long PCIe traces
- High-speed Gen5/Gen6
- Retimers = required

---

## CXL opportunity

**Compute Express Link (CXL):**
- Memory pooling protocol
- Extends memory beyond CPU
- Enables memory sharing
- Growing AI relevance

**Astera's CXL products:**
- Memory controllers
- Memory expansion
- Fabric connectivity
- Early market leader

---

## AI server connectivity

**How it fits:**
```
CPU ↔ PCIe retimer ↔ GPU
         (Astera)
    
Memory pool ↔ CXL controller ↔ Multiple hosts
                (Astera)
```

**Every AI server needs connectivity ICs.**
