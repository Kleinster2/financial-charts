## PCIe retimers

**What's a retimer?**
- Regenerates degraded signals
- Extends PCIe reach
- Enables longer traces, cables
- Essential for large servers

**AI server need:**
- GPUs far from CPU
- Long PCIe traces
- High-speed Gen5/Gen6
- Retimers = required

---

## CXL opportunity

**Compute Express Link (CXL):**
- Memory pooling protocol
- Extends memory beyond CPU
- Enables memory sharing
- Growing AI relevance

**Astera's CXL products:**
- Memory controllers
- Memory expansion
- Fabric connectivity
- Early market leader

---

## AI server connectivity

**How it fits:**
```
CPU ↔ PCIe retimer ↔ GPU
         (Astera)
    
Memory pool ↔ CXL controller ↔ Multiple hosts
                (Astera)
```

**Every AI server needs connectivity ICs.**

## Founders (Bloomberg Billionaires, Nov 2025)

| Name | Role | Net worth |
|------|------|-----------|
| Jitendra Mohan | CEO | **$1.5B** |
| Sanjay Gajendra | COO | **$1.5B** |

**Origin story:** Both ex-Texas Instruments engineers. Spotted opportunity: AI would need better data center connectivity. TI wasn't interested — they started Astera in Gajendra's garage (Santa Clara, 2017).

**Mohan on the thesis:** "A new nervous system would be needed for data centers."
