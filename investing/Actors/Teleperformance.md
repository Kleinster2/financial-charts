## Business model

Teleperformance connects enterprises with consumers via:
- **Omnichannel contact centers** — voice, chat, email, social media
- **Content moderation** — trust & safety for tech platforms
- **Back-office operations** — data entry, claims processing
- **Specialized services** — debt collection, telemarketing, CRM

Clients: technology, financial services, healthcare, retail, travel, government. Revenue model is labor arbitrage — hire workers in lower-cost countries (India, Philippines, Latin America) to handle customer interactions for Western companies.

### Majorel acquisition (2023)

Acquired [[Majorel]] for ~€3B, adding content moderation and multilingual capabilities. Pushed revenue above €10B but added leverage (2.57x Net Debt/EBITDA).

## The AI disruption timeline

Teleperformance is the **single most damaged public company** from the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] and the broader AI chatbot revolution. The timeline:

### 2023: ChatGPT arrives — first fears

- AI chatbot capabilities become obvious to enterprises
- Market begins questioning BPO model — if AI can handle customer service, why outsource to humans?
- Stock begins declining from 2022 highs

### Feb 28, 2024: The Klarna moment

**[[Klarna]] announced its OpenAI-powered customer service assistant was handling two-thirds of all customer service calls** — replacing the equivalent of 700 full-time agents.

- TEP crashed **-14% in a single day** to 7-year low
- [[Concentrix]] (world's #2 BPO) fell -11% in sympathy
- CEO Daniel Julien insisted "AI cannot replace human staff"
- Market didn't believe him

This was the first concrete proof that AI chatbots could replace outsourced call centers at scale. Not a demo, not a pilot — Klarna actually did it.

### Mar 2024 – Dec 2025: Slow bleed

- Stock continued declining as more companies announced AI customer service deployments
- Revenue growth collapsed: historical 14% CAGR → analyst consensus **1.1% annual growth** through 2030
- Margins under pressure from wage inflation + client budget cuts
- TLScontact (visa services) contract lost — further undermining growth narrative

### Feb 2026: Short interest spikes again

- Shares on loan rose to **6.4%** of float (from 3.8% in late January) per S&P Global Securities Finance
- Well above 2.4% average for European tech-services companies
- Bears betting AI disruption accelerates as models improve
- Earnings due **Feb 27, 2026** — a catalyst event
- Context: broader [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] reinforcing the narrative

## The AI bear case

The fundamental threat is existential: **if AI can handle 70%+ of customer service interactions, Teleperformance's 500,000 employees become a liability, not an asset.**

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Klarna precedent** | 2/3 of customer calls handled by AI — equivalent of 700 agents replaced |
| **Inference cost curve** | GPU rental prices falling (see [[GPU rental price index]]) — AI gets cheaper every quarter |
| **Model improvement** | Each generation of LLMs handles more complex, nuanced interactions |
| **Client incentive** | Enterprises pay TEP for labor hours — AI eliminates the need for those hours |
| **Speed** | AI chatbots respond instantly; human agents have hold times |
| **Multilingual** | LLMs speak 100+ languages natively — TEP's 300-language workforce is less differentiated |
| **Content moderation** | Especially vulnerable — LLMs can classify content faster and more consistently than humans |

The 1.1% revenue growth consensus isn't "conservative" — it may be optimistic if AI adoption accelerates. A company that grew 14% annually for a decade is now priced for near-zero growth.

## The bull case (value trap debate)

At ~€60 with 7% dividend yield, TEP is priced for severe disruption. The bull case:

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Revenue still €10B+** | AI hasn't destroyed revenue yet — it's still growing (barely) |
| **Complex interactions** | Many customer service cases require empathy, judgment, regulatory knowledge AI can't match |
| **Hybrid model** | TEP is integrating AI tools to augment human agents, not replace them |
| **Enterprise inertia** | Large clients (banks, insurers, governments) change slowly — 3-5 year contract cycles |
| **Regulatory barriers** | Some verticals (healthcare, government) require human oversight |
| **Valuation floor** | Trading at ~4x P/E, 7% yield — priced as if business disappears |
| **Buyback potential** | If cash generation holds, stock is cheap enough for aggressive buybacks |

The Reddit/Medium value investing community is actively debating whether TEP is a value trap or a massive overreaction. The honest answer: it depends entirely on AI adoption speed. If enterprises take 5+ years to replace human agents, TEP is absurdly cheap. If 2-3 years, it's a melting ice cube.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Revenue | Ticker | AI exposure |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Teleperformance** | €10.3B | TEP (Paris) | Highest — pure call center |
| **Concentrix** | ~$9B | CNXC (NASDAQ) | High — similar model |
| **Conduent** | ~$3.5B | CNDT (NASDAQ) | Moderate — more back-office |
| **TaskUs** | ~$900M | TASK (NASDAQ) | High — content moderation heavy |
| **TTEC** | ~$2B | TTEC (NASDAQ) | High — customer experience |
| **Genpact** | ~$4.5B | G (NYSE) | Moderate — more analytics/consulting |

The entire BPO sector trades at depressed multiples. TEP is the largest and most shorted.

## Earnings watch: Feb 27, 2026

FY 2025 results due Thursday. Key metrics to watch:
- Revenue growth (or decline?) vs 1.1% consensus
- AI investment disclosures — what is TEP spending on AI tools?
- Client retention — any more lost contracts?
- Guidance — does management acknowledge AI threat or maintain "AI can't replace humans" line?
- Short interest reaction — if earnings disappoint, 6.4% could spike further
