## Business model

Teleperformance connects enterprises with consumers via:
- Omnichannel contact centers — voice, chat, email, social media
- Content moderation — trust & safety for tech platforms
- Back-office operations — data entry, claims processing
- Specialized services — debt collection, telemarketing, CRM

Clients: technology, financial services, healthcare, retail, travel, government. Revenue model is labor arbitrage — hire workers in lower-cost countries (India, Philippines, Latin America) to handle customer interactions for Western companies.

### Majorel acquisition (2023)

Acquired [[Majorel]] for ~€3B, adding content moderation and multilingual capabilities. Pushed revenue above €10B but added leverage (2.57x Net Debt/EBITDA).

## Evolution

The story of Teleperformance is the story of a business model that worked perfectly for 45 years and then had its core assumption — that humans are cheaper than machines for cognitive labor — invalidated in about 18 months.

- 1978: Daniel Julien founds Teleperformance in Paris. The insight is pure labor arbitrage: companies need people to answer phones, and it's cheaper to outsource that function than staff it in-house. The call center industry barely exists yet. Julien is building the category, not entering it
- 1986-1996: International expansion — Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, UK, then across the Atlantic to the US (1992) and Asia-Pacific (Philippines, Singapore, 1996). Each new geography is a new labor pool. The model scales because it's the same playbook everywhere: rent floor space, hire cheap labor, connect phone lines, charge Western companies per-hour rates. Revenue grows from nothing to hundreds of millions of euros. The Philippines becomes the global epicenter of BPO — English-speaking, low-cost, large young population — and Teleperformance is there early
- 1998-2006: Latin America build-out — Argentina, Brazil, Mexico. Rochefortaise Communication merges with Teleperformance International in 1999 to form S.R. Teleperformance (simplified to just Teleperformance in 2006). The company is now a genuine multinational: revenue hits €2.3B by 2012, 137,000 employees across dozens of countries. Julien builds through a mix of organic expansion and bolt-on acquisitions — buying AOL's call center in Utah (2006), technical support firm Twenty4help, debt collector AllianceOne (both 2007)
- 2013-2016: The acquisition machine accelerates. TLScontact (visa processing, 2013) adds a high-value government services vertical. Aegis USA ($610M, 2014) brings scale in the US, Philippines, and Costa Rica. LanguageLine Solutions ($1.52B from Abry Partners, 2016) is the biggest deal — the US market leader in translation/interpretation services, diversifying beyond pure call centers. Revenue goes from €2.4B (2013) to €3.6B (2016). Employee count jumps from 148K to 216K. The strategy: buy every adjacent capability and every labor pool, become so big and so embedded in client operations that switching is unthinkable
- 2017-2019: Julien returns as CEO after interim CEO Paulo César Salles Vasques resigns (Oct 2017). Revenue accelerates: €4.1B → €4.4B → €5.3B. Net profit doubles from €312M to €400M. Content moderation becomes a growth engine — [[Meta]], [[Google]], [[TikTok]] all need armies of human moderators to review flagged content. Teleperformance supplies those armies. The stock begins a multi-year rally that will eventually take it from ~€100 to €400+
- 2020-2022 (COVID peak): The pandemic is both crisis and catalyst. Call centers in the Philippines become public health nightmares — workers sleeping at desks, unable to social distance, labor union complaints across ten countries. But demand explodes: NHS contracts, COVID support hotlines, e-commerce customer service. Teleperformance launches Cloud Campus (remote work infrastructure) in Portugal, then Philippines and Mexico. Revenue surges from €5.7B (2020) to €7.1B (2021) to €8.1B (2022). Net profit peaks at €645M. Employee count hits 418K — nearly half a million people. Stock hits all-time high of €402.10 on January 4, 2022. At that moment, Teleperformance is the most valuable company on the French CAC Mid 60, a CAC 40 constituent, and the undisputed king of global BPO. The thesis seems invincible: the world will always need humans to talk to other humans
- 2023 (the Majorel bet): Teleperformance acquires [[Majorel]] for ~€3B — a massive doubling-down on scale. Majorel (spun out of [[Bertelsmann]] and Moroccan firm Saham) adds content moderation capacity, multilingual capabilities, and Middle East/Africa exposure. Revenue crosses €10B for the first time. But the deal adds significant leverage (2.57x net debt/EBITDA) right as the existential threat materializes. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 — by the time the Majorel deal closes in January 2024, the market is already asking whether 490,000 human call center agents are a liability, not an asset
- Feb 28, 2024 (the Klarna moment): [[Klarna]] announces its OpenAI-powered customer service assistant handles two-thirds of all customer interactions — equivalent of 700 full-time agents. TEP crashes 14% in a single day to a 7-year low. [[Concentrix]] falls 11% in sympathy. This isn't a demo or a pilot — it's a live production system replacing human agents at scale. CEO Daniel Julien insists "AI cannot replace human staff." The market doesn't believe him. The stock, which was €402 two years earlier, is now below €100
- 2024-2025 (slow bleed): Revenue growth collapses — historical 14% CAGR falls to essentially flat. Analyst consensus: 1.1% annual growth through 2030. The company tries to pivot: partnership with Sanas (AI accent adjustment, $13M equity investment), Carnegie Mellon AI research partnership, acquisition of AI crowdsourcing platform Agents Only, launch of TP.ai FAB orchestration platform. But these are a call center company trying to become an AI company — the market doesn't buy it. Stock falls to €29 in late 2024 (down 93% from ATH) before recovering to ~€60. Short interest rises to 6.4% of float, nearly 3x the European tech-services average
- Feb 2026 (leadership capitulation): FY2025 results show revenue down 0.7% to €10.21B — the first year of actual decline. More significantly, the board announces founder Daniel Julien, deputy CEO Thomas Mackenbrock, and deputy CEO/CFO Olivier Rigaudy will all step down on March 15, 2026. [[Jorge Amar]] appointed CEO. After 48 years, Julien's entire leadership team is swept out. The man who built the call center industry is leaving as AI dismantles it. The company that was worth €24B in January 2022 is worth €3.5B — an 85% destruction of market value in four years

The arc: French call center pioneer → global labor arbitrage empire (€10B revenue, 490K employees, 170 markets) → AI chatbots make the core model obsolete → 85% stock collapse → founder exits. The Majorel acquisition in 2023 will likely be studied as one of the worst-timed deals in corporate history — paying €3B to double down on human call center capacity six months after ChatGPT proved machines could do the job.

## The AI disruption timeline

Teleperformance is the single most damaged public company from the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] and the broader AI chatbot revolution. The timeline:

### 2023: ChatGPT arrives — first fears

- AI chatbot capabilities become obvious to enterprises
- Market begins questioning BPO model — if AI can handle customer service, why outsource to humans?
- Stock begins declining from 2022 highs

### Feb 28, 2024: The Klarna moment

[[Klarna]] announced its OpenAI-powered customer service assistant was handling two-thirds of all customer service calls — replacing the equivalent of 700 full-time agents.

- TEP crashed -14% in a single day to 7-year low
- [[Concentrix]] (world's #2 BPO) fell -11% in sympathy
- CEO Daniel Julien insisted "AI cannot replace human staff"
- Market didn't believe him

This was the first concrete proof that AI chatbots could replace outsourced call centers at scale. Not a demo, not a pilot — Klarna actually did it.

### Mar 2024 – Dec 2025: Slow bleed

- Stock continued declining as more companies announced AI customer service deployments
- Revenue growth collapsed: historical 14% CAGR → analyst consensus 1.1% annual growth through 2030
- Margins under pressure from wage inflation + client budget cuts
- TLScontact (visa services) contract lost — further undermining growth narrative

### Feb 2026: Short interest spikes again

- Shares on loan rose to 6.4% of float (from 3.8% in late January) per S&P Global Securities Finance
- Well above 2.4% average for European tech-services companies
- Bears betting AI disruption accelerates as models improve
- Earnings due Feb 27, 2026 — a catalyst event
- Context: broader [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] reinforcing the narrative

## The AI bear case

The fundamental threat is existential: if AI can handle 70%+ of customer service interactions, Teleperformance's 500,000 employees become a liability, not an asset.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Klarna precedent | 2/3 of customer calls handled by AI — equivalent of 700 agents replaced |
| Inference cost curve | GPU rental prices falling (see [[GPU rental price index]]) — AI gets cheaper every quarter |
| Model improvement | Each generation of LLMs handles more complex, nuanced interactions |
| Client incentive | Enterprises pay TEP for labor hours — AI eliminates the need for those hours |
| Speed | AI chatbots respond instantly; human agents have hold times |
| Multilingual | LLMs speak 100+ languages natively — TEP's 300-language workforce is less differentiated |
| Content moderation | Especially vulnerable — LLMs can classify content faster and more consistently than humans |

The 1.1% revenue growth consensus isn't "conservative" — it may be optimistic if AI adoption accelerates. A company that grew 14% annually for a decade is now priced for near-zero growth.

## The bull case (value trap debate)

At ~€60 with 7% dividend yield, TEP is priced for severe disruption. The bull case:

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue still €10B+ | AI hasn't destroyed revenue yet — it's still growing (barely) |
| Complex interactions | Many customer service cases require empathy, judgment, regulatory knowledge AI can't match |
| Hybrid model | TEP is integrating AI tools to augment human agents, not replace them |
| Enterprise inertia | Large clients (banks, insurers, governments) change slowly — 3-5 year contract cycles |
| Regulatory barriers | Some verticals (healthcare, government) require human oversight |
| Valuation floor | Trading at ~4x P/E, 7% yield — priced as if business disappears |
| Buyback potential | If cash generation holds, stock is cheap enough for aggressive buybacks |

The Reddit/Medium value investing community is actively debating whether TEP is a value trap or a massive overreaction. The honest answer: it depends entirely on AI adoption speed. If enterprises take 5+ years to replace human agents, TEP is absurdly cheap. If 2-3 years, it's a melting ice cube.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | Revenue | Ticker | AI exposure |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Teleperformance | €10.3B | TEP (Paris) | Highest — pure call center |
| Concentrix | ~$9B | CNXC (NASDAQ) | High — similar model |
| Conduent | ~$3.5B | CNDT (NASDAQ) | Moderate — more back-office |
| TaskUs | ~$900M | TASK (NASDAQ) | High — content moderation heavy |
| TTEC | ~$2B | TTEC (NASDAQ) | High — customer experience |
| Genpact | ~$4.5B | G (NYSE) | Moderate — more analytics/consulting |

The entire BPO sector trades at depressed multiples. TEP is the largest and most shorted.

## FY2025 results (reported Feb 26, 2026)

| Metric | FY2025 | Y/Y |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Revenue | €10.21B | -0.7% |
| Like-for-like growth | +1.3% | (ex hyperinflation) |
| Adj EBITA | €1.49B | -3.4% |
| Net profit (group share) | €497M | — |
| Adjusted net profit | €781M | — |

### FY2026 guidance

| Metric | Guide | vs Est |
|--------|-------|--------|
| LFL sales growth | 0% to +2% | Est. +1.65% |
| Adj EBITA margin | 14.6% | Beat (est. 14.3%) |
| Net free cash flow | €800-850M | Miss (est. €918M) |
| Dividend | €4.50/share (+7%) | — |

### CEO succession

Board appointed Jorge Amar as CEO effective March 15, 2026. Founder/CEO Daniel Julien, Deputy CEO Thomas Mackenbrock, and Deputy CEO/Group CFO Olivier Rigaudy all step down the same day. Clean sweep of top leadership after nearly 50 years of founder control.

Revenue decline is real but modest. Margin guidance beat suggests cost management working. FCF guide miss and full C-suite change signal internal uncertainty. At ~€60 (~85% below ATH), the stock already prices severe disruption — this report extends the "slowly then suddenly" timeline without resolving the fundamental question.
