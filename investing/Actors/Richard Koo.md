# Richard Koo

Chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. Developed the **balance sheet recession** framework to explain [[Japan lost decades|Japan's lost decades]] — when the private sector simultaneously deleverages after an asset bubble, monetary policy becomes ineffective (liquidity trap) and only fiscal stimulus sustains demand. Framework later applied to post-2008 US/Europe.
