## Why Obsidian matters

**Local-first:** Files stored as plain Markdown on your device. No lock-in. Works offline.

**Bidirectional links:** `[[wikilinks]]` create knowledge graphs. Pioneered "second brain" movement.

**Plugin ecosystem:** 1,500+ community plugins. Extensible to any workflow.

**Privacy:** No account required for core app. Sync is E2E encrypted.

## Product philosophy

From Erica Xu: "We want to help people build their personal knowledge base."

Design principles:
- **Local-first** — your data, your device
- **Plain text** — Markdown files, future-proof
- **Extensible** — plugins for everything
- **No lock-in** — export anytime

## Competitive position

| vs | Obsidian advantage | Obsidian weakness |
|----|-------------------|-------------------|
| [[Notion]] | Local, private, no lock-in | Less collaborative |
| [[Roam Research]] | Free, faster, better UX | Less academic focus |
| [[Apple]] Notes | Power, plugins, links | Learning curve |
| Logseq | More mature, larger community | Less outliner-focused |

## Cultural impact

Spawned "PKM" (Personal Knowledge Management) movement:
- Zettelkasten method revival
