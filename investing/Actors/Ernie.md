## Autonomous driving link

ERNIE powers [[Baidu]]'s Apollo autonomous driving:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Apollo Go robotaxis | 600+ vehicles |
| Cities | 10+ in China |
| Rides | Millions completed |

AI model → autonomous driving → real-world deployment. Unique among Chinese AI labs.

## Competitive position

| vs | Ernie advantage | Disadvantage |
|----|----------------|--------------|
| [[Doubao]] | Search integration, AV | Less consumer engagement |
| [[Qwen]] | Autonomous driving, chips | Less open source traction |
| [[DeepSeek]] | Enterprise distribution | Less efficiency narrative |
| [[ChatGPT]] | China market, price | Global brand |

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Ernie is a Baidu product.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Baidu]] (BIDU/9888.HK) — parent, directly benefits
- Kunlunxin spinoff potential

**Thesis implications:**
- AI + autonomous driving convergence
- Domestic chip development (Kunlunxin)
- Search → AI transition
