## Prismic Life — Prudential's Bermuda sidecar play

**Prudential is building its own PE-insurance model:**

Prismic Life is a Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance platform co-sponsored with [[Warburg Pincus]]:
- Nov 2025: Third capital raise of $1.3B
- Expected to allocate ~$15B to assets managed by PGIM and [[Warburg Pincus]]
- Effectively a [[Reinsurance sidecars|reinsurance sidecar]] — third-party capital + PGIM asset management

This positions Prudential as both a traditional insurer *and* a PE-style platform — using PGIM's asset management to generate spread on reinsured liabilities, similar to how [[Apollo]] uses [[Athene]].

## Annuity product focus

Key products reflect shift toward principal protection + market participation:
- **FlexGuard 2.0** — registered index-linked annuity (buffer annuity)
- **SurePath Income** — fixed indexed annuity
- **WealthGuard** — multi-year guaranteed annuity

Low annuity adoption (29% per Prudential's 2025 Global Retirement Pulse Survey) signals growth runway.

## Competitive positioning

Prudential is unique among traditional insurers: rather than simply shedding liabilities to PE platforms, it's building a competing model via Prismic/PGIM. This hybrid approach — traditional distribution + alternative asset management — could represent the next evolution of [[PE-insurance convergence]].
