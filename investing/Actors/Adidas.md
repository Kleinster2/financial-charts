## The Gulden turnaround

**The crisis (2022):** Adidas terminated Ye (Kanye West) partnership → €1.2B Yeezy revenue gone overnight. Stock collapsed. Operating loss of €700M.

**Gulden's playbook (2023-2025):**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Faster decision-making | Flatter org, empowered teams |
| Return to sport | Rebuilt athlete partnerships |
| Retro revival | Samba, Gazelle, Campus = cultural phenomenon |
| Full-price focus | Cut discounting, protect margins |
| Localized products | Regional preferences over global uniformity |
| Yeezy liquidation | Sold remaining stock, donated profits to charity |

## The retro sneaker phenomenon

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Samba** | #1 sneaker globally (2024) |
| **Gazelle** | Fashion staple |
| **Campus** | Growing fast |
| **Spezial** | Collector/enthusiast |

**Risk:** Fashion cycles. Sambas/Gazelles can't stay on-trend forever. Adidas is managing this by controlling supply and spacing new colorways — but the clock is ticking.

## Regional performance (2024)

| Region | Growth | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Europe]] | +18.9% | Strongest, home market |
| Greater [[China]] | +10.3% | Recovery |
| [[Japan]]/Korea | +10.1% | Strong |
| [[Emerging markets]] | +19.4% | Excellent |
| **North America** | **-1.6%** | Weakest (improving to double-digit growth by year-end) |

## vs. Nike

| Factor | Adidas | [[Nike]] |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | €23.7B | $46.3B |
| 2024 growth | +12% | -10% |
| Trend | Gaining share | Losing share |
| Cultural moment | Samba/Gazelle heat | Innovation drought |
| Margin | 5.6% (recovering) | Higher but declining |
| Stock (2024) | +16% | -27% |

**Roles reversed:** For the first time in a decade, Adidas has cultural momentum and Nike doesn't. But Nike is 2x the size — even a partial recovery dwarfs Adidas.

## Tariff impact

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 tariff cost | ~€120M (down from €200M initial estimate) |
| 2026 expected | Higher |
| Manufacturing | Vietnam, Indonesia, [[China]] |
| Mitigation | Supply chain diversification |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Turnaround ahead of schedule (operating profit 5x in 2 years)
- Samba/Gazelle driving brand heat
- Operating margin trajectory → 10%+
- Taking share from Nike globally
- Gulden is a proven operator (ex-Puma CEO)
- [[China]] recovering (+10%)

**Bear:**
- Retro sneaker cycle will fade (fashion risk)
- North America still weak (-1.6%)
- Valuation rich (~30x forward earnings)
- Tariff headwinds increasing
- Need to prove post-retro product pipeline
- Nike's turnaround could reverse share gains
