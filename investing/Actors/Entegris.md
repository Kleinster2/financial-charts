**Entegris** — US semiconductor materials and contamination control leader. Acquired CMC Materials (2022) to become \#2 in CMP slurries. Critical supplier for advanced node manufacturing.

---

## Why Entegris matters

Controls contamination = controls yield. Entegris provides the materials and equipment that keep fabs clean:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ENTG (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$18B |
| 2024 revenue | ~$3.5B |
| CMP slurry share | ~25% (\#2 globally) |
| Pad share | Smaller ([[DuPont]]/Qnity dominates) |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Products | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Materials Solutions** | CMP slurries, pads, cleans | CMC acquisition |
| **Microcontamination Control** | Filters, purifiers | Yield-critical |
| **Advanced Materials Handling** | Wafer carriers, FOUPs | Cleanroom logistics |

## CMC Materials acquisition (2022)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $6.5B |
| CMC revenue | ~$1.2B |
| Strategic rationale | CMP slurry leadership |
| Result | \#2 in slurries behind [[Fujifilm]] |

CMC Materials (formerly Cabot Microelectronics) was the original CMP slurry pioneer.

## CMP market position

| Company | Slurry share | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **[[Fujifilm]]** | ~31% | \#1, strong in Cu slurry |
| **Entegris** | ~25% | \#2, CMC acquisition |
| Fujimi | ~15% | [[Japan]] |
| Others | ~29% | Fragmented |

**CMP pads:** [[Qnity]] ([[DuPont]]) dominates at >70% share.

## Why CMP matters

Chemical Mechanical Planarization = polishing wafers flat between process steps:
- More layers = more CMP steps
- 3D NAND (1000+ layers) = massive CMP demand
- GAA transistors = more planarization
- Backside power delivery = new CMP applications

**Growth driver:** CMP steps per wafer increasing with node complexity.

---

## Recent developments

- **May 2023:** Multi-year TSMC agreement for CMP slurries
- **2024:** New Korea facility for local supply
- **2024:** US R&D center expansion

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Critical supplier for advanced nodes
- CMC acquisition created CMP scale
- TSMC, Samsung, Intel all customers
- Contamination control = yield = value
- Consumables model (recurring)

**Bear:**
- Competition from [[Fujifilm]], Fujimi
- [[China]] localization attempts
- Cyclical semiconductor demand
- Integration risk (CMC)
- Qnity dominates pads segment

## Financials snapshot

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | ~$3.5B |
| Gross margin | ~45% |
| R&D intensity | ~10% |
