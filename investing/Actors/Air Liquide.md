## Why Air Liquide matters

Largest European semiconductor gas supplier, expanding aggressively:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | AI.PA (Paris) |
| Market cap | ~€90B |
| Group revenue | ~€27B |
| Electronics revenue | €2.5B (2024) |
| Position | #1 [[Europe]], top 3 global |

---

## Electronics business

| Segment | Products |
|---------|----------|
| **Carrier gases** | Ultra-pure N2, Ar, He, H2 |
| **Specialty gases** | Etch, deposition, doping |
| **Advanced materials** | Precursors for ALD/CVD |
| **Equipment** | On-site gas generation |

---

## Market position

### Global semiconductor gases

| Company | Position | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Linde | Top tier | Merged with Praxair |
| Air Products | Top tier | US leader |
| **Air Liquide** | Top tier | [[Europe]] leader |
| [[Taiyo Nippon Sanso]] | Top tier | [[Japan]] leader |

**Top 3-4 = 35%+ of specialty gas market.**

---

## European semiconductor expansion

**€250M+ investment (2025):**
- Largest-ever electronics investment in [[Europe]]
- Dresden "Silicon Saxony" facility
- Long-term contract with major fab (likely Intel/TSMC)
- On-site high-purity gas production

**Strategic rationale:**
- European Chips Act driving fab investment
- Intel, TSMC, [[Infineon]] expanding in [[Europe]]
- Local supply = strategic value

---

## Global footprint

| Region | Facilities | Key customers |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| [[Europe]] | Dresden, [[France]] | Intel, [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]] |
| [[Asia]] | [[Taiwan]], Korea, [[Japan]] | TSMC, [[Samsung]] |
| Americas | US sites | Intel, [[GlobalFoundries]] |

## Why on-site supply matters

Large fabs need massive gas volumes:
- **[[Transport]] risk:** Ultra-pure gases degrade
- **Security of supply:** Fab downtime = $M/hour
- **Economics:** On-site production cheaper at scale

Air Liquide builds gas plants inside or adjacent to fabs.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- European Chips Act tailwind
- Diversified industrial gas base
- On-site model = sticky customers
- Semiconductor growing faster than base
- [[ESG]] focus (low-GWP gases)

**Bear:**
- Semiconductor = small % of total
- Competition from Linde, Air Products
- [[Europe]] energy costs
- Cyclical fab utilization
- Capital-intensive

## Financials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Group revenue | ~€27B |
| Electronics revenue | €2.5B (~9%) |
| Group EBITDA margin | ~25% |
