## Simile

AI startup building generative agent simulations of real human behavior. Spun out of [[Stanford]] frontier research — commercializing the "Generative Agents" papers that demonstrated LLM-based agents can replicate individual humans' survey responses with 85% accuracy.

### What they do

Simile creates AI agents ("similes") based on real people by conducting two-hour qualitative interviews, then building behavioral models from the transcripts. Companies use these agent populations for:

- Simulated focus groups — CVS created hundreds of thousands of similes representing real customers for product testing, store layout design, and pain point analysis
- Digital polling panels — Gallup partnership to build nationally representative AI panels for probability-based consumer sentiment modeling
- Earnings call prediction — simulated analyst panels predicted 8/10 questions actually asked on a Fortune 500 earnings call
- Product concept testing — Suntory using it to accelerate product development timelines

The model trains on interview data, historical transaction data, and behavioral science literature.

### Founding team

| Person | Role | Background |
|--------|------|------------|
| Joon Sung Park | CEO, co-founder | Stanford PhD (HCI), lead author on both Generative Agents papers |
| [[Michael Bernstein]] | Co-founder | Stanford CS professor, 8 best paper awards, on leave until Fall 2026 |
| [[Percy Liang]] | Co-founder | Stanford CS professor, founding director of CRFM, coined "foundation model" |
| Lainie Yallen | Co-founder | BCG → co-founded TriplePlay (acquired by [[Roblox]]) → [[Hebbia]] |

### Research lineage

The company is a direct commercialization of two Stanford papers:

1. "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" (2023) — 25 agents in a simulated town exhibiting believable social behavior. Best Paper at UIST 2023. 14,800+ GitHub stars.
2. "Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People" (2024) — scaled to 1,052 real individuals. Agents replicated participants' General Social Survey responses 85% as accurately as the participants replicated their own answers two weeks later. Reduced accuracy biases across racial and ideological groups.

### Competitive context

Behavior prediction/simulation is a crowded aspiration but has had mixed results historically. Traditional approaches (conjoint analysis, survey panels, focus groups) are slow and expensive. The generative AI angle is the differentiator — unstructured interview data was previously hard to leverage at scale.

The $100M raise at launch is aggressive for a 7-month-old model. The [[Fei-Fei Li]] and [[Andrej Karpathy]] angel investments signal Stanford AI establishment backing.
