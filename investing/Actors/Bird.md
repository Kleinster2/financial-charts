# Bird

The cautionary tale of micromobility. Fastest company to reach $1B valuation (9 months, 2018), peaked at $2.5B via SPAC (2021), filed Chapter 11 in Dec 2023 with $3.[[3M]] cash and $1.6B accumulated deficit. Acquired by Third Lane Mobility for $145M (Apr 2024). Plot twist: now profitable — $20M adj. EBITDA in 2024, profitable every month since restructuring. Operates as anchor brand of Third Lane alongside Spin.

## The arc

### Founding and blitz-scale (2017–2019)

**Founder:** Travis VanderZanden — former COO of [[Lyft]], then VP International Growth at [[Uber]]. Left Uber Sep 2016. Bought his daughters scooters, discovered the [[Xiaomi]] M365, saw the opportunity.

**Sep 2017:** Deployed first 10 consumer-grade [[Xiaomi]] scooters in Santa Monica. No permits, no city approval. Santa Monica filed criminal complaints. Bird paid $300K+ in fines.

| Date | Event | Valuation |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Feb 2018 | Series A ($15M) | — |
| Mar 2018 | Series B ($100M) | — |
| May 2018 | Unicorn status | $1B (9 months from founding) |
| Jun 2018 | Series C ($300M), Sequoia led | $2B |
| End 2019 | Total VC raised | ~$700M |

**The pitch:** Last-mile transport for dense cities. Replace car trips. $40-50B TAM (BCG estimate). Winner-takes-all dynamics.

**The reality:** No network effects. Vehicles lasted <6 months. Ops costs >$3/ride. VC-subsidized growth with no unit economics.

### Public market disaster (2021–2023)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Nov 2021 | SPAC merger, raised $414M, valued at $2.5B |
| Nov 2022 | Market cap: $70M (12 months after debut) |
| Nov 2022 | Admitted overstating revenue for 2+ years |
| Sep 2023 | Delisted from NYSE (low stock price) |
| Jun 2023 | VanderZanden departs |
| Dec 2023 | Chapter 11 filing ($3.[[3M]] cash remaining) |

### Financials (public era)

| Year | Revenue | Net loss | Adj. EBITDA | FCF |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|-----|
| 2020 | ~$95M | — | — | — |
| 2021 | $190M | -$215M | -$81M | -$347M |
| 2022 | $245M | -$359M | -$62M | -$146M |
| 2023 (LTM) | ~$202M | — | — | — |

**Total cash burned (2020–2022):** >$650M. Total VC + SPAC capital destroyed: ~$1.1B.

### Restructuring and rebirth (2024–present)

Third Lane Mobility — consortium of Bird's second-lien (John Bitove / Obelysk) and first-lien (MidCap Financial / [[Apollo]]) holders — acquired assets via 363 sale for $145M.

**2024 results (under Third Lane):**
- 35M rides
- $220M gross receipts
- ~$20M adj. EBITDA
- **Profitable every month** (Mar–Dec 2024)
- ~150K vehicles across 200+ cities (Bird + Spin brands)
- Largest micromobility operator in North America

**2025:** Q1 ridership +33% YoY. Raised $20M for 35K new vehicles (deploying Spring 2026 in Atlanta, LA, Nashville, Baltimore, SF, Seattle, Tel Aviv, Rome).

## What went wrong

| Failure mode | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Vehicle economics** | [[Consumer]]-grade [[Xiaomi]] scooters lasted <6 months. Replacement cost ate all revenue |
| **Growth-over-profit** | Expanded to 100+ cities before proving unit economics in any single market |
| **SPAC timing** | Went public at peak hype with no path to profitability |
| **Revenue fraud** | Overstated revenue for 2+ years; credibility destroyed |
| **Leadership** | VanderZanden was a growth executive, not an operator; departed before bankruptcy |
| **VC structure** | Winner-takes-all assumption wrong; no network effects in scooters |
| **COVID** | Ridership collapsed 2020; never fully recovered pre-bankruptcy |

### Why Third Lane works where Bird didn't

| Before (Bird Global) | After (Third Lane) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Growth at all costs | Profitability first |
| 100+ cities, thinly spread | 200 cities but right-sized fleets |
| [[Consumer]]-grade scooters | Purpose-built vehicles, longer lifespan |
| Massive HQ overhead | Lean operations |
| $1.6B accumulated deficit | Clean balance sheet |
| Public market pressure | Private, patient capital |
