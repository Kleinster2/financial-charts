**SpaceX** — Musk's rocket/satellite company. [[Starlink]] dominates satellite internet. **Acquired [[xAI]] Feb 2026** at $1.25T combined valuation ahead of mega-IPO.

## Why SpaceX matters

| Business | Scale | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **[[Starlink]]** | 9,000+ satellites | Satellite internet, direct-to-cell |
| **Launch** | Dominant provider | Falcon 9, Starship |
| **Starshield** | Military variant | [[Defense]] contracts |
| **[[Space]] data centers** | Planned | Orbital AI compute |

## IPO (2026)

**Targeting June 2026 (around Musk's birthday):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] valuation | **$1.5T** (would rival [[Saudi Aramco]] IPO) |
| **IPO raise target** | **$50B** (would be largest IPO ever) |
| Recent internal valuation | $800B ($421/share, Dec 2025) |
| July 2025 valuation | $400B ($212/share) |
| 2025 revenue | ~$15B |
| 2026 revenue forecast | $22-24B |
| Revenue driver | [[Starlink]] (majority) |

**[[Dual-class shares]] structure (Feb 13, 2026):** Bloomberg reports SpaceX weighing a formal dual-class share structure for the IPO. Musk already holds ~42% equity with ~79% voting control — a dual-class IPO would formalize this for public markets, ensuring he retains control post-dilution from the $30-50B raise. Follows the [[Google]]/[[Meta]]/[[Snap]] playbook. Key institutional concern: "key-man risk" amplified when that key man can't be checked by shareholders. S&P reversed its dual-class ban in April 2023, so index inclusion no longer blocked — but governance-focused investors may still push for sunset provisions.

**Purpose:** Fund space-based data centers and AI infrastructure. Not just a rocket bet — framed as AI infrastructure play.

**Bull case:** Ark Invest sees $2.5T+ by 2030 if [[Starlink]] and space AI scale.

## xAI acquisition (Feb 2, 2026)

**SpaceX acquired xAI — deal closed:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined valuation | **$1.25T** |
| SpaceX contribution | ~$1T (25% step-up from $800B) |
| xAI contribution | ~$250B |
| IPO target | **$50B raise** |

**Why now:** xAI burning ~$1B/month with $208M revenue (9M 2025). SpaceX's ~$8B 2025 profit can fund xAI's infrastructure buildout.

**Tesla excluded:** Tesla's $2B xAI investment now in SpaceX subsidiary — raising fiduciary concerns.

**Musk ownership post-deal:** 42% SpaceX (with 79% voting control), 51% xAI stake converts to SpaceX equity.

See [[SpaceX xAI merger]] for full analysis.

## Defense applications

**Critical upcoming contracts requiring Starship:**

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Golden Dome** | Missile shield program |
| **Artemis** | NASA moon missions |
| **US Space Force** | Various launch contracts |

SpaceX-xAI merger would help Musk complete Starship development to compete for these launches. Starship full reusability not yet achieved — 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

---

## [[Starlink]]

**Satellite internet constellation:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Satellites | 9,000+ in orbit |
| Coverage | Global (incl. remote areas) |
| Direct-to-cell | Partnership with [[T-Mobile]] |
| V3 satellites | 3x larger, 60 Tbps capacity, launching Q1 2026 |

**[[Starlink]] V3:**
- 1,250 kg each (vs smaller V2)
- Gigabit residential speeds
- Advanced phased-array antennas
- Enables space-based data centers

---

## [[Space]] data centers (Jan 2026)

**Musk's vision: 100GW orbital compute network**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity target | **100 GW** combined |
| Timeline | "4-5 years if we can solve the other parts" |
| IPO purpose | $30B+ to fund this initiative |
| Technology | Repurpose [[Starlink]] satellite tech |

**Why space:**
- 24/7 solar power (sun-synchronous orbit)
- No land constraints
- Simpler permitting (FAA + FCC bulk licenses)
- Bypass Earth's [[Power constraints]]

**SpaceX advantage:**
- 9,300+ [[Starlink]] satellites (operational experience)
- Starship for heavy payload launches
- Vertical integration

**Dependency:** Requires Starship full reusability (not yet achieved). 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

See [[Space data centers]] for full concept analysis.

### Lunar factory & MassDriver (Feb 10, 2026)

Musk told xAI employees (now SpaceX subsidiary) that the company needs a lunar factory to manufacture AI satellites, with an electromagnetic mass driver ("MassDriver") to catapult them into orbit. This represents a **major Mars-to-Moon pivot:**

| Shift | Before | Now |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Priority | Mars city in 5-7 years | **Moon city in <10 years** |
| Mars timeline | 5-7 years | **20+ years** |
| Rationale | "Make life multiplanetary" | "Moon is faster" for securing civilization |

**Musk (Feb 2026):** "SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years."

**IPO implication:** Moon-first is a more credible near-term narrative for institutional investors than Mars. Lunar infrastructure for AI satellites ties directly to the orbital data center thesis and gives the $50B IPO raise a tangible near-term use of proceeds story.

## Semiconductor/chip relevance

**Custom silicon:**
- Satellite chips (proprietary)
- User terminal chips
- AI modem development with Samsung (3nm process)
- [[Space]] DC chips (radiation-hardened)

---

## Samsung partnership

**AI modem for [[Starlink]]:**
- Samsung developing AI modem chip for satellite communications
- Fabricated on Samsung 3nm process
- Targeting 6G/non-terrestrial networks
- Integration into [[Starlink]] terminals and phones

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- [[Starlink]] revenue growing rapidly
- 2026 IPO = liquidity event
- [[Space]]-based AI data centers narrative
- Direct-to-cell disrupts telecom
- [[Defense]] contracts (Starshield)
- Musk execution track record

**Bear:**
- $1.5T = extremely high bar
- Satellite economics unproven at scale
- Musk distraction (Tesla, xAI, [[DOGE]])
- Regulatory/spectrum risks
- Competition ([[Amazon]] Kuiper)
