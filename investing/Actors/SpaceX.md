**SpaceX** — Musk's rocket/satellite company. Starlink dominates satellite internet. **2026 IPO planned** at $1.5T target valuation.

---

## Why SpaceX matters

| Business | Scale | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Starlink** | 9,000+ satellites | Satellite internet, direct-to-cell |
| **Launch** | Dominant provider | Falcon 9, Starship |
| **Starshield** | Military variant | Defense contracts |
| **Space data centers** | Planned | Orbital AI compute |

## IPO (2026)

**Targeting mid-to-late 2026:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target valuation | **$1.5T** (would rival Saudi Aramco IPO) |
| Recent internal valuation | $800B ($421/share, Dec 2025) |
| July 2025 valuation | $400B ($212/share) |
| 2025 revenue | ~$15B |
| 2026 revenue forecast | $22-24B |
| Revenue driver | Starlink (majority) |

**Bull case:** Ark Invest sees $2.5T+ by 2030 if Starlink and space AI scale.

## Starlink

**Satellite internet constellation:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Satellites | 9,000+ in orbit |
| Coverage | Global (incl. remote areas) |
| Direct-to-cell | Partnership with T-Mobile |
| V3 satellites | 3x larger, 60 Tbps capacity, launching Q1 2026 |

**Starlink V3:**
- 1,250 kg each (vs smaller V2)
- Gigabit residential speeds
- Advanced phased-array antennas
- Enables space-based data centers

## Space data centers (Jan 2026)

**Musk's vision: 100GW orbital compute network**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity target | **100 GW** combined |
| Timeline | "4-5 years if we can solve the other parts" |
| IPO purpose | $30B+ to fund this initiative |
| Technology | Repurpose Starlink satellite tech |

**Why space:**
- 24/7 solar power (sun-synchronous orbit)
- No land constraints
- Simpler permitting (FAA + FCC bulk licenses)
- Bypass Earth's [[Power constraints]]

**SpaceX advantage:**
- 9,300+ Starlink satellites (operational experience)
- Starship for heavy payload launches
- Vertical integration

**Dependency:** Requires Starship full reusability (not yet achieved). 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

See [[Space data centers]] for full concept analysis.

## Semiconductor/chip relevance

**Custom silicon:**
- Satellite chips (proprietary)
- User terminal chips
- AI modem development with Samsung (3nm process)
- Space DC chips (radiation-hardened)

---

## Samsung partnership

**AI modem for Starlink:**
- Samsung developing AI modem chip for satellite communications
- Fabricated on Samsung 3nm process
- Targeting 6G/non-terrestrial networks
- Integration into Starlink terminals and phones

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Starlink revenue growing rapidly
- 2026 IPO = liquidity event
- Space-based AI data centers narrative
- Direct-to-cell disrupts telecom
- Defense contracts (Starshield)
- Musk execution track record

**Bear:**
- $1.5T = extremely high bar
- Satellite economics unproven at scale
- Musk distraction (Tesla, xAI, DOGE)
- Regulatory/spectrum risks
- Competition (Amazon Kuiper)
