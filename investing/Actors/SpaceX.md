## Evolution

The story of SpaceX is the story of a man who wanted to put a greenhouse on Mars, got laughed out of Russia, and decided to build the rockets himself — then almost went bankrupt three times before building the most valuable private company on earth.

- 2001-2002 (Mars Oasis): [[Elon Musk]], fresh off selling PayPal to eBay for $1.5B (his share: ~$180M), becomes obsessed with making humanity multiplanetary. His initial plan isn't to build rockets — it's to buy one. He flies to Moscow twice in 2001-2002 to negotiate purchasing refurbished Russian ICBMs to send a small greenhouse to Mars as a publicity stunt to reignite public interest in space. The Russians keep raising the price and reportedly spit on him. On the flight home from the second failed trip, Musk opens a spreadsheet on the plane, calculates the raw material cost of building a rocket from scratch, and realizes the aerospace industry has been marking up launch costs by 10-100x through decades of cost-plus government contracting. He doesn't need Russian rockets. He needs to build his own. SpaceX incorporates in May 2002. Musk puts in $100M of his own money — more than half his PayPal fortune

- 2002-2005 (building from scratch): Musk hires Tom Mueller, a propulsion engineer from TRW who had been building rocket engines in his garage as a hobby. Mueller becomes VP of Propulsion and designs the Merlin engine — the engine that will eventually power both Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. The founding team works out of a warehouse in El Segundo, California. [[Founders Fund]] ([[Peter Thiel]]) leads the Series A at $0.10/share (split-adjusted). The thesis is radical for 2002: rockets should be manufactured like cars, not like cathedrals. Vertical integration, rapid iteration, commodity materials where possible. The entire aerospace industry thinks this is naive. Series B ($11M, Feb 2005) from [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]]. Total team: ~160 people

- 2006-2008 (three failures, near death): Falcon 1 launches from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Flight 1 (March 2006): engine fire at T+25 seconds, rocket crashes back onto the launch pad. Flight 2 (March 2007): reaches space but second stage fails due to fuel slosh. Flight 3 (August 2008): first and second stages collide during separation — the payload (including the ashes of Star Trek actor James Doohan) is lost. Three failures in a row. SpaceX is running out of money. Musk is simultaneously hemorrhaging cash at Tesla (also near bankruptcy). He later said he had to choose between putting his last money into SpaceX or Tesla — he split it between both, knowing that if either failed he'd lose everything. NASA's $278M COTS contract (2006) and $1.6B Commercial Resupply Services contract (2008) provide lifelines, but both require successful orbital flights that SpaceX hasn't achieved yet

- September 28, 2008 (the fourth flight): Falcon 1 Flight 4 reaches orbit. It's the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit in history. SpaceX had enough money for exactly one more attempt. Musk: "The fourth launch worked, or that would have been it for SpaceX." Six weeks later, NASA awards the CRS contract. The company survives

- 2010-2012 (Falcon 9 and the NASA bet): Falcon 9 first launches in June 2010 — a much larger rocket designed to carry the Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. In May 2012, Dragon becomes the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS. This is the moment SpaceX transitions from "might work" to "works." Regular ISS resupply missions begin. Revenue becomes real. Series F ($50.6M, Oct 2010) values the company at $1.3B. SpaceX is no longer a startup — it's a space logistics company

- 2013-2015 (the reusability gamble): SpaceX begins the most audacious bet in aerospace history: landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse. The entire industry says it's impossible or impractical — the fuel required to slow and land a booster reduces payload capacity, and the economics of refurbishment will never beat building new. SpaceX tries anyway. Multiple landing attempts fail spectacularly (ocean barges, close calls). Then on December 21, 2015, Falcon 9 Flight 20's first stage lands vertically back at Cape Canaveral. The crowd erupts. It's the first time an orbital-class rocket booster has ever been recovered. The second landing, on a drone ship at sea, follows in April 2016. Series G ($1B, Jan 2015, led by [[Google]] and [[Fidelity]]) values SpaceX at $12B. Google's $900M gives it a strategic stake in what's coming next: Starlink

- 2017-2019 (reusability proven, Starlink begins): In March 2017, SpaceX re-flies a previously used Falcon 9 booster for the first time — proving reusability works operationally, not just as a stunt. Launch costs plummet. SpaceX begins dominating the commercial launch market by undercutting incumbents ([[United Launch Alliance]], [[Arianespace]]) by 50-70%. February 2018: Falcon Heavy's maiden flight sends Musk's personal Tesla Roadster into solar orbit — the most powerful operational rocket in the world, with synchronized booster landings that look like science fiction. In May 2019, the first batch of 60 Starlink satellites launches. This is the pivot that transforms SpaceX from a launch company into an infrastructure company. The plan: 12,000+ satellites (later expanded to 42,000) forming a global broadband internet constellation. Revenue source shifts from launch contracts (~$2-3B/year) to recurring subscription revenue at scale

- 2020 (astronauts): May 30, 2020: Crew Dragon carries NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the ISS — the first time a private company launches humans into orbit. The US hasn't launched astronauts from American soil since the Space Shuttle retired in 2011. SpaceX has now done what only three nation-states (US, Russia, China) have ever done. Series N ($2.57B, Aug 2020) values SpaceX at $46B. Starlink beta service ("Better Than Nothing Beta") opens to early users

- 2021-2023 (Starlink scales, Starship begins): Starlink subscribers grow from beta to millions. Revenue crosses $1B, then $2B, then accelerates. SpaceX launches more mass to orbit than every other entity on Earth combined — countries included. Falcon 9 becomes the most-launched rocket in history. In February 2022, SpaceX does a 10-for-1 stock split (common shares only). Meanwhile, Starship development begins in Boca Chica, Texas — a fully reusable super-heavy launch vehicle designed to carry 100+ tons to orbit, enabling Mars colonization, point-to-point Earth travel, and the space data center vision. Starship's first orbital test (April 2023) explodes minutes after launch. Second test (November 2023) makes it to space but loses the upper stage. The iterative approach that worked for Falcon 1 is repeating — blow up, learn, try again

- 2024-2025 (the trillion-dollar company): Starlink crosses 4M subscribers and becomes profitable on its own. SpaceX revenue hits ~$15B with ~$8B profit. Starship testing progresses — the "chopstick catch" of a returning Super Heavy booster in October 2024 becomes one of the most-watched videos in aerospace history. Private market valuations explode: $210B (June 2024) → $350B (Dec 2024) → $400B (July 2025) → $800B (Dec 2025). Starlink V3 satellites (3x larger, gigabit speeds) begin production. Direct-to-cell partnership with [[T-Mobile]] announced. [[Starshield]] (military Starlink variant) wins defense contracts. SpaceX is now launching approximately every 2-3 days — more than one launch per week. Baron Capital holds ~$10B across funds, the largest outside investor

- 2026 (the convergence): SpaceX acquires [[xAI]] (Musk's AI company) in February at a combined $1.25T valuation. The thesis: Starlink's 9,000+ satellite constellation becomes the backbone for space-based AI data centers — 100GW of orbital compute powered by 24/7 solar in sun-synchronous orbit. IPO targeted for June 2026 at $1.5T, raising $30-50B — would be the largest IPO in history. Musk announces a pivot from Mars-first to Moon-first: a self-sustaining lunar city in under 10 years, with a lunar factory and electromagnetic mass driver to catapult AI satellites into orbit. Pentagon drone swarm contracts, Starshield expansion, and the xAI merger position SpaceX as simultaneously a launch company, an internet company, a defense contractor, and an AI infrastructure play

The arc: greenhouse on Mars → laughed out of Russia → $100M personal bet → three failed launches → fourth flight saves everything → ISS resupply → reusable rockets (impossible → routine) → Starlink (launch company → infrastructure company) → first private astronaut launches → $1.25T valuation → space data centers. From $0.10/share to $588/share in 24 years — a 5,880x return. The man who got spat on in Moscow built the most valuable private company in history.

## Why SpaceX matters

| Business | Scale | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| [[Starlink]] | 9,000+ satellites | Satellite internet, direct-to-cell |
| Launch | Dominant provider | Falcon 9, Starship |
| Starshield | Military variant | [[Defense]] contracts |
| [[Space]] data centers | Planned | Orbital AI compute |

---

## IPO (2026)

Targeting June 2026 (around Musk's birthday):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] valuation | $1.5T (would rival [[Saudi Aramco]] IPO) |
| IPO raise target | $50B (would be largest IPO ever) |
| Recent internal valuation | $800B ($421/share, Dec 2025) |
| July 2025 valuation | $400B ($212/share) |
| 2025 revenue | ~$15B |
| 2026 revenue forecast | $22-24B |
| Revenue driver | [[Starlink]] (majority) |

[[Dual-class shares]] structure (Feb 13, 2026): Bloomberg reports SpaceX weighing a formal dual-class share structure for the IPO. Musk already holds ~42% equity with ~79% voting control — a dual-class IPO would formalize this for public markets, ensuring he retains control post-dilution from the $30-50B raise. Follows the [[Google]]/[[Meta]]/[[Snap]] playbook. Key institutional concern: "key-man risk" amplified when that key man can't be checked by shareholders. S&P reversed its dual-class ban in April 2023, so index inclusion no longer blocked — but governance-focused investors may still push for sunset provisions.

Purpose: Fund space-based data centers and AI infrastructure. Not just a rocket bet — framed as AI infrastructure play.

Bull case: Ark Invest sees $2.5T+ by 2030 if [[Starlink]] and space AI scale.

---

## xAI acquisition (Feb 2, 2026)

SpaceX acquired xAI — deal closed:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined valuation | $1.25T |
| SpaceX contribution | ~$1T (25% step-up from $800B) |
| xAI contribution | ~$250B |
| IPO target | $50B raise |

Why now: xAI burning ~$1B/month with $208M revenue (9M 2025). SpaceX's ~$8B 2025 profit can fund xAI's infrastructure buildout.

Tesla excluded: Tesla's $2B xAI investment now in SpaceX subsidiary — raising fiduciary concerns.

Musk ownership post-deal: 42% SpaceX (with 79% voting control), 51% xAI stake converts to SpaceX equity.

See [[SpaceX xAI merger]] for full analysis.

## Defense applications

Critical upcoming contracts requiring Starship:

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Golden Dome | Missile shield program |
| Artemis | NASA moon missions |
| US Space Force | Various launch contracts |

SpaceX-xAI merger would help Musk complete Starship development to compete for these launches. Starship full reusability not yet achieved — 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

### Pentagon autonomous drone swarm contest (Feb 16, 2026)

SpaceX and subsidiary [[xAI]] competing in a $100M Pentagon prize challenge to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming technology:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prize pool | $100M |
| Duration | 6 months |
| Organizers | Defense Innovation Unit + Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG) |
| DAWG parent | US Special Operations Command |
| Phases | 5 — software → live platforms → target awareness → "launch to termination" |

Key details:
- SpaceX and xAI working on the entire project together — software to coordinate drone movements across air and sea domains
- [[OpenAI]] supporting a separate bid from [[Applied Intuition]], limited to voice-to-digital "mission control" translation only (no drone operation or targeting)
- xAI hiring engineers with "secret" and "top secret" clearances for federal contractor work; already has $200M Pentagon contract to integrate [[Grok]] into military systems
- Contest launched Jan 2026, continuing work from Biden-era Replicator initiative (expendable autonomous drones)
- Marks controversial new direction — Musk previously signed open letter (2015) against offensive autonomous weapons
- Defense officials expressed concern about integrating generative AI (prone to hallucinations) into weapons platforms
- DAWG official: human-machine interaction "will directly impact the lethality and effectiveness of these systems"

## [[Starlink]]

Satellite internet constellation:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Satellites | 9,000+ in orbit |
| Coverage | Global (incl. remote areas) |
| Direct-to-cell | Partnership with [[T-Mobile]] |
| V3 satellites | 3x larger, 60 Tbps capacity, launching Q1 2026 |

[[Starlink]] V3:
- 1,250 kg each (vs smaller V2)
- Gigabit residential speeds
- Advanced phased-array antennas
- Enables space-based data centers

---

## [[Space]] data centers (Jan 2026)

Musk's vision: 100GW orbital compute network

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity target | 100 GW combined |
| Timeline | "4-5 years if we can solve the other parts" |
| IPO purpose | $30B+ to fund this initiative |
| Technology | Repurpose [[Starlink]] satellite tech |

Why space:
- 24/7 solar power (sun-synchronous orbit)
- No land constraints
- Simpler permitting (FAA + FCC bulk licenses)
- Bypass Earth's [[Power constraints]]

SpaceX advantage:
- 9,300+ [[Starlink]] satellites (operational experience)
- Starship for heavy payload launches
- Vertical integration

Dependency: Requires Starship full reusability (not yet achieved). 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

See [[Space data centers]] for full concept analysis.

### Lunar factory & MassDriver (Feb 10, 2026)

Musk told xAI employees (now SpaceX subsidiary) that the company needs a lunar factory to manufacture AI satellites, with an electromagnetic mass driver ("MassDriver") to catapult them into orbit. This represents a major Mars-to-Moon pivot:

| Shift | Before | Now |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Priority | Mars city in 5-7 years | Moon city in <10 years |
| Mars timeline | 5-7 years | 20+ years |
| Rationale | "Make life multiplanetary" | "Moon is faster" for securing civilization |

Musk (Feb 2026): "SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years."

IPO implication: Moon-first is a more credible near-term narrative for institutional investors than Mars. Lunar infrastructure for AI satellites ties directly to the orbital data center thesis and gives the $50B IPO raise a tangible near-term use of proceeds story.

## Semiconductor/chip relevance

Custom silicon:
- Satellite chips (proprietary)
- User terminal chips
- AI modem development with Samsung (3nm process)
- [[Space]] DC chips (radiation-hardened)

---

## Samsung partnership

AI modem for [[Starlink]]:
- Samsung developing AI modem chip for satellite communications
- Fabricated on Samsung 3nm process
- Targeting 6G/non-terrestrial networks
- Integration into [[Starlink]] terminals and phones

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- [[Starlink]] revenue growing rapidly
- 2026 IPO = liquidity event
- [[Space]]-based AI data centers narrative
- Direct-to-cell disrupts telecom
- [[Defense]] contracts (Starshield)
- Musk execution track record

Bear:
- $1.5T = extremely high bar
- Satellite economics unproven at scale
- Musk distraction (Tesla, xAI, [[DOGE]])
- Regulatory/spectrum risks
- Competition: [[Amazon]] Kuiper, [[SpaceSail]] (China, state-backed, 15,000 sats by 2030, already licensed in Brazil)

## Cap table

### Private market price history

![[spacex-private-price-chart.png]]
*Split-adjusted price per share across all funding rounds, secondaries, and tender offers (log scale). $0.10 (Series A, 2002) → $588 (Jan 2026 secondary) = 5,880x over 24 years. Staircase pattern reflects discrete private-market price events. The 2010-2015 gap ($0.75 → $7.75) corresponds to the Falcon 9 proving flights and early [[Starlink]] development. The 2024-2026 acceleration ($112 → $588, 5.2x in 18 months) reflects [[Starlink]] profitability, the [[SpaceX xAI merger]], and IPO anticipation.*
