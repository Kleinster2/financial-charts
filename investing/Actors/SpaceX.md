SpaceX — Musk's rocket/satellite company. [[Starlink]] dominates satellite internet. Acquired [[xAI]] Feb 2026 at $1.25T combined valuation ahead of mega-IPO.

---

## Why SpaceX matters

| Business | Scale | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| [[Starlink]] | 9,000+ satellites | Satellite internet, direct-to-cell |
| Launch | Dominant provider | Falcon 9, Starship |
| Starshield | Military variant | [[Defense]] contracts |
| [[Space]] data centers | Planned | Orbital AI compute |

---

## IPO (2026)

Targeting June 2026 (around Musk's birthday):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Target]] valuation | $1.5T (would rival [[Saudi Aramco]] IPO) |
| IPO raise target | $50B (would be largest IPO ever) |
| Recent internal valuation | $800B ($421/share, Dec 2025) |
| July 2025 valuation | $400B ($212/share) |
| 2025 revenue | ~$15B |
| 2026 revenue forecast | $22-24B |
| Revenue driver | [[Starlink]] (majority) |

[[Dual-class shares]] structure (Feb 13, 2026): Bloomberg reports SpaceX weighing a formal dual-class share structure for the IPO. Musk already holds ~42% equity with ~79% voting control — a dual-class IPO would formalize this for public markets, ensuring he retains control post-dilution from the $30-50B raise. Follows the [[Google]]/[[Meta]]/[[Snap]] playbook. Key institutional concern: "key-man risk" amplified when that key man can't be checked by shareholders. S&P reversed its dual-class ban in April 2023, so index inclusion no longer blocked — but governance-focused investors may still push for sunset provisions.

Purpose: Fund space-based data centers and AI infrastructure. Not just a rocket bet — framed as AI infrastructure play.

Bull case: Ark Invest sees $2.5T+ by 2030 if [[Starlink]] and space AI scale.

## xAI acquisition (Feb 2, 2026)

SpaceX acquired xAI — deal closed:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined valuation | $1.25T |
| SpaceX contribution | ~$1T (25% step-up from $800B) |
| xAI contribution | ~$250B |
| IPO target | $50B raise |

Why now: xAI burning ~$1B/month with $208M revenue (9M 2025). SpaceX's ~$8B 2025 profit can fund xAI's infrastructure buildout.

Tesla excluded: Tesla's $2B xAI investment now in SpaceX subsidiary — raising fiduciary concerns.

Musk ownership post-deal: 42% SpaceX (with 79% voting control), 51% xAI stake converts to SpaceX equity.

See [[SpaceX xAI merger]] for full analysis.

## Defense applications

Critical upcoming contracts requiring Starship:

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Golden Dome | Missile shield program |
| Artemis | NASA moon missions |
| US Space Force | Various launch contracts |

SpaceX-xAI merger would help Musk complete Starship development to compete for these launches. Starship full reusability not yet achieved — 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

### Pentagon autonomous drone swarm contest (Feb 16, 2026)

SpaceX and subsidiary [[xAI]] competing in a $100M Pentagon prize challenge to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming technology:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prize pool | $100M |
| Duration | 6 months |
| Organizers | Defense Innovation Unit + Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG) |
| DAWG parent | US Special Operations Command |
| Phases | 5 — software → live platforms → target awareness → "launch to termination" |

Key details:
- SpaceX and xAI working on the entire project together — software to coordinate drone movements across air and sea domains
- [[OpenAI]] supporting a separate bid from [[Applied Intuition]], limited to voice-to-digital "mission control" translation only (no drone operation or targeting)
- xAI hiring engineers with "secret" and "top secret" clearances for federal contractor work; already has $200M Pentagon contract to integrate [[Grok]] into military systems
- Contest launched Jan 2026, continuing work from Biden-era Replicator initiative (expendable autonomous drones)
- Marks controversial new direction — Musk previously signed open letter (2015) against offensive autonomous weapons
- Defense officials expressed concern about integrating generative AI (prone to hallucinations) into weapons platforms
- DAWG official: human-machine interaction "will directly impact the lethality and effectiveness of these systems"

## [[Starlink]]

Satellite internet constellation:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Satellites | 9,000+ in orbit |
| Coverage | Global (incl. remote areas) |
| Direct-to-cell | Partnership with [[T-Mobile]] |
| V3 satellites | 3x larger, 60 Tbps capacity, launching Q1 2026 |

[[Starlink]] V3:
- 1,250 kg each (vs smaller V2)
- Gigabit residential speeds
- Advanced phased-array antennas
- Enables space-based data centers

---

## [[Space]] data centers (Jan 2026)

Musk's vision: 100GW orbital compute network

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity target | 100 GW combined |
| Timeline | "4-5 years if we can solve the other parts" |
| IPO purpose | $30B+ to fund this initiative |
| Technology | Repurpose [[Starlink]] satellite tech |

Why space:
- 24/7 solar power (sun-synchronous orbit)
- No land constraints
- Simpler permitting (FAA + FCC bulk licenses)
- Bypass Earth's [[Power constraints]]

SpaceX advantage:
- 9,300+ [[Starlink]] satellites (operational experience)
- Starship for heavy payload launches
- Vertical integration

Dependency: Requires Starship full reusability (not yet achieved). 2025 testing had multiple unplanned explosions.

See [[Space data centers]] for full concept analysis.

### Lunar factory & MassDriver (Feb 10, 2026)

Musk told xAI employees (now SpaceX subsidiary) that the company needs a lunar factory to manufacture AI satellites, with an electromagnetic mass driver ("MassDriver") to catapult them into orbit. This represents a major Mars-to-Moon pivot:

| Shift | Before | Now |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Priority | Mars city in 5-7 years | Moon city in <10 years |
| Mars timeline | 5-7 years | 20+ years |
| Rationale | "Make life multiplanetary" | "Moon is faster" for securing civilization |

Musk (Feb 2026): "SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years."

IPO implication: Moon-first is a more credible near-term narrative for institutional investors than Mars. Lunar infrastructure for AI satellites ties directly to the orbital data center thesis and gives the $50B IPO raise a tangible near-term use of proceeds story.

## Semiconductor/chip relevance

Custom silicon:
- Satellite chips (proprietary)
- User terminal chips
- AI modem development with Samsung (3nm process)
- [[Space]] DC chips (radiation-hardened)

---

## Samsung partnership

AI modem for [[Starlink]]:
- Samsung developing AI modem chip for satellite communications
- Fabricated on Samsung 3nm process
- Targeting 6G/non-terrestrial networks
- Integration into [[Starlink]] terminals and phones

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- [[Starlink]] revenue growing rapidly
- 2026 IPO = liquidity event
- [[Space]]-based AI data centers narrative
- Direct-to-cell disrupts telecom
- [[Defense]] contracts (Starshield)
- Musk execution track record

Bear:
- $1.5T = extremely high bar
- Satellite economics unproven at scale
- Musk distraction (Tesla, xAI, [[DOGE]])
- Regulatory/spectrum risks
- Competition ([[Amazon]] Kuiper)

## Cap table

### Private market price history

![[spacex-private-price-chart.png]]
*Split-adjusted price per share across all funding rounds, secondaries, and tender offers (log scale). $0.10 (Series A, 2002) → $588 (Jan 2026 secondary) = 5,880x over 24 years. Staircase pattern reflects discrete private-market price events. The 2010-2015 gap ($0.75 → $7.75) corresponds to the Falcon 9 proving flights and early [[Starlink]] development. The 2024-2026 acceleration ($112 → $588, 5.2x in 18 months) reflects [[Starlink]] profitability, the [[SpaceX xAI merger]], and IPO anticipation.*

### Funding rounds (complete)

Total raised: ~$12B across 31 rounds from 229+ investors. All preferred series carry 1x non-participating [[Liquidation preference|liquidation preference]].

10-for-1 common stock split in Feb 2022 (common only — preferred shares not split). Pre-split common traded ~$560-610, reset to ~$56-61. Prices below show both original issue price and split-adjusted equivalent.
