## Why Synopsys matters

Every advanced chip needs Synopsys tools:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | SNPS |
| Market cap | ~$80B |
| Revenue | ~$6B |
| Margin | 30%+ operating |
| Position | #1 EDA |

## What is EDA?

**Electronic Design Automation:**
- Software to design chips
- Simulation & verification
- Physical layout
- Manufacturing prep

Without EDA tools, no chips get made.

## Product portfolio

| Category | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Design | Design Compiler, Fusion Compiler |
| Verification | VCS, Verdi |
| IP | DesignWare (USB, PCIe, DDR) |
| Silicon lifecycle | Yield optimization |

## Ansys acquisition

**$35B deal (2024):**
- Adds simulation/physics
- Chip + system-level design
- Regulatory approval pending
- Creates design mega-platform

---

## Competitive landscape

| Player | Position | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Synopsys | #1 | 32% market share |
| [[Cadence]] | #2 | 30% market share |
| Siemens EDA | #3 | Mentor Graphics |

Effective duopoly for advanced nodes.

## AI angle

**AI chip explosion = EDA demand:**
- Every AI chip needs design tools
- Complexity increasing
- AI-assisted chip design (Synopsys.ai)
- More chips = more licenses

Picks and shovels for chip design.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Duopoly pricing power
- Essential for all chipmakers
- AI chip boom = demand surge
- High switching costs
- Recurring revenue model

**Bear:**
- $35B Ansys deal = integration risk
- High valuation
- China exposure concerns
- Customer concentration
