## Why Redwood matters

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Founder pedigree** | JB Straubel was Tesla CTO 2004-2019 |
| **Vertical integration** | Recycling → refined materials → anode/cathode precursors |
| **Strategic location** | Nevada, adjacent to Tesla/Panasonic Gigafactory |
| **US supply chain** | Domestic alternative to Chinese refining |
| **IRA beneficiary** | Domestic content = tax credit eligibility for OEMs |

## Process

```
Collection → Shredding → Black mass → Hydrometallurgy → Refined materials
                                            ↓
                              Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper (95%+ recovery)
                                            ↓
                              Anode + Cathode precursors → back to cell makers
```

**Efficiency gains vs mining:**
- 80% less energy
- 80% less water
- 70% less CO2

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Founder with Tesla credibility
- Only scaled US battery recycler
- EV battery wave coming 2027+ (feedstock surge)
- IRA domestic content tailwind
- OEM partnerships locked in

**Bear case:**
- Commodity price exposure (lithium crashed 2023)
- Capital intensive
- Competition from Li-Cycle, Ascend Elements
- China dominates globally
