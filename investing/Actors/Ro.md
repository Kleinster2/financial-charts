**Ro** — Vertically integrated telehealth platform (consultation → diagnostics → pharmacy → delivery). Founded 2017 as "Roman" (men's health), pivoted to full-stack healthcare. Valued at $7B (Feb 2022). Emerged as [[Novo Nordisk]]'s preferred large-scale D2C telehealth partner for [[GLP-1 receptor agonists|GLP-1]] distribution after Novo terminated [[Hims & Hers]] (Jun 2025).

## Why Ro matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | October 2017 |
| HQ | New York City |
| Status | Private (no S-1 filed) |
| Last valuation | $7B (Feb 2022) |
| Total funding | ~$1.03B |
| GLP-1 revenue est. | ~$370M (2024, Sacra) |
| Digital visits | 8M+ cumulative |
| Employees | ~831 |

Ro controls the full stack — telehealth consultation, at-home diagnostics, in-house pharmacy fulfillment, and home delivery. Most telehealth competitors rely on third-party pharmacies. This vertical integration is the core moat.

The [[Novo Nordisk]] relationship is the key strategic asset. After Novo terminated [[Hims & Hers]] in June 2025 over continued compounded semaglutide sales and sued them in February 2026, Ro is positioned as Novo's primary large-scale D2C distribution partner. Novo's general counsel publicly praised Ro for "doing the right things" on compounding compliance.

## Cap table

| Date | Event | Investors | Amount | Valuation |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 2017 | Seed | [[General Catalyst]] | $3.1M | — |
| 2018 | Series A | — | Part of $88M A/B | — |
| Apr 2019 | Series B | — | (see above) | $500M |
| Jul 2020 | Series C | [[General Catalyst]] (lead) | $200M | $1.5B |
| Mar 2021 | Series D | [[General Catalyst]], [[FirstMark Capital]], TQ Ventures | $500M | $5B |
| Feb 2022 | Series D-II | [[ShawSpring Partners]] (lead) | $150M | $7B |

Total equity raised: ~$1.03B across 7 rounds from 41 investors.

Key investors: [[General Catalyst]] (lead in multiple rounds), [[FirstMark Capital]], [[ShawSpring Partners]], TQ Ventures, [[SignalFire]], [[Initialized Capital]], [[Altimeter Capital]], [[The Baupost Group]], [[Alexis Ohanian|Seven Seven Six]], BoxGroup.

Valuation staleness: Last priced Feb 2022 — over 4 years ago. No new primary round. For context, [[Hims & Hers]] (public) trades at ~$8-10B market cap with ~$1.5B revenue, suggesting Ro's $7B mark may be aggressive relative to its likely smaller revenue base. The Jun 2022 layoffs (18% of workforce) and narrowing of focus suggest the company was cash-flow negative and moved toward efficiency.

## Revenue

| Year | GLP-1 Revenue (est.) | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|

| Wegovy pill (oral semaglutide) | Day 1 Novo partner (launched Jan 5, 2026) | $149/mo (1.5mg, 4mg)               |             |
| [[Eli Lilly]]                  | Zepbound]] vials                          | LillyDirect integration (Dec 2024) | $299-449/mo |

Ro published a peer-reviewed study in *Obesity* journal: patients on their platform achieved 16.6% body weight loss over 68 weeks on semaglutide (n=4,500), consistent with Novo's clinical trial results.

### Acquisitions

| Company | Category | What it added |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| WorkPath | At-home phlebotomy | In-home blood draws |
| Kit | Diagnostics | At-home testing kits |
| Modern Fertility | Women's health | Fertility testing |
| Dadi | Men's health | Sperm testing/storage |

## Business model

Revenue streams:
1. Subscription memberships — Ro Body ($145/mo), Roman, Rory, Zero
2. Medication fulfillment — In-house pharmacy captures margin (cash-pay, largely bypasses insurance)
3. Lab/diagnostics — At-home blood draws (WorkPath), testing kits (Kit), fertility (Modern Fertility, Dadi)
4. B2B platform licensing — Digital clinic management software to providers

Key structural advantage: Vertical integration. Ro controls consultation → diagnostics → pharmacy → delivery. Competitors like [[Hims & Hers]] have replicated this (Hims owns compounding facilities), but Ro's Novo relationship gives it a differentiated supply advantage post-compounding crackdown.

Customer churn: ~50% annually (Sacra estimate) — structural challenge across all telehealth. GLP-1 weight regain after discontinuation (~2/3 of weight lost is regained within a year of stopping) could exacerbate this.

## Key partnerships

| Partner | Relationship | Date |
|---------|-------------|------|
| [[Novo Nordisk]] | Day 1 launch partner for Wegovy pill; NovoCare integration | Jan 2026 |
| [[Eli Lilly]] | LillyDirect integration for Zepbound vials | Dec 2024 |
| Serena Williams | Brand ambassador (lost 34 lbs in 1 year on GLP-1s, cholesterol down 30%) | Aug 2025 |
| Charles Barkley | Brand ambassador (lost 45 lbs in 7 months on GLP-1s) | Apr 2025 |

Conflict-of-interest note: Serena Williams is married to [[Alexis Ohanian]], Ro board member and investor since 2017. This has drawn criticism.

## Investment case

### Bull
- Novo Nordisk's preferred partner — With [[Hims & Hers]] terminated and sued, Ro has a structural advantage in branded GLP-1 distribution. As long as Novo controls semaglutide supply, this relationship is a moat.
- Vertical integration — Owning the pharmacy + diagnostics stack captures more margin per patient than pure telehealth prescribers.
- Oral GLP-1 expansion — Wegovy pill ($149/mo) dramatically lowers the barrier to entry. Oral dosing expands TAM to needle-averse patients (~25% of population).
- Super Bowl brand investment — Feb 2026 Super Bowl ad signals confidence in scaling consumer acquisition.

### Bear
- Valuation uncertainty — $7B last priced Feb 2022. No new round in 4+ years. Likely marked down significantly. May struggle to raise at same valuation given comp compression.
- Compounding exposure — Still offers compounded semaglutide in some states. FDA sent 100+ cease-and-desist letters to telehealth industry (Sep 2025). Any compliance misstep could jeopardize the Novo relationship.
- Disintermediation risk — [[Novo Nordisk]] (NovoCare) and [[Eli Lilly]] (LillyDirect) are investing in direct-to-patient channels. Telehealth platforms could be disintermediated over time.
- Insurance expansion risk — If employer/Medicare coverage for GLP-1s expands, patients shift from cash-pay telehealth to traditional providers, shrinking addressable market.
- High churn — ~50% annual churn across telehealth. GLP-1 weight regain after discontinuation exacerbates this.
- Ohanian/Williams conflict of interest — Board member's spouse as paid ambassador draws scrutiny and potential FTC advertising risk.
