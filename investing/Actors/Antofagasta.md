## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Pure-play copper in stable jurisdiction ([[Chile]])
- Centinela second concentrator adds 30% growth by 2027
- Los Pelambres Stage 2 completion Q2 2026
- Low net cash costs ($1.05/lb in Q4 2025)
- Family ownership = long-term thinking
- Strong by-product credits (gold, moly)
- FTSE 100 liquidity

**Bear:**
- [[Chile]]-only concentration risk
- Grade decline across portfolio (13% in 5 years)
- $4.4B Centinela capex = execution risk
- Premium valuation for copper purity
- Water scarcity in Atacama
- 2025 production missed guidance (653.7kt vs 660–700kt)
- 4 labour agreements expiring in 2026
