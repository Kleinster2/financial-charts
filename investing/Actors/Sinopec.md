## Why Sinopec matters

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Size | World's largest refiner by capacity |
| State control | Chinese government majority owned |
| Venezuela buyer | Purchases Venezuelan crude |
| Downstream focus | Refining, chemicals, retail |

---

## Company structure

| Entity | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Sinopec Group | Parent, state-owned |
| Sinopec Corp | Listed subsidiary |
| Tickers | 386.HK, 600028.SS, SNP (ADR) |

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Refining | Largest capacity globally |
| Chemicals | Petrochemicals, plastics |
| Marketing | Gas stations, retail |
| E&P | Upstream (smaller than [[CNPC]]) |

## Venezuela relationship

**Oil buyer:**

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Crude purchases | Buys Venezuelan heavy crude |
| Refinery fit | Some refineries configured for heavy crude |
| Loan exposure | Lower than CNPC |
| Current status | Reduced volumes due to production collapse |

**Post-[[Maduro capture 2026]]:**
- May lose Venezuelan crude access
- US companies likely prioritized
- Refinery feedstock diversified anyway

---

## Investment angle

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~$80B |
| Refining capacity | ~6M bpd |
| Dividend yield | ~8-10% |
| ADR | SNP (NYSE) |

**Risks:**
- State-owned = political control
- Refining margins volatile
- China demand slowdown
- Sanctions exposure (Iran crude)

## vs CNPC

| Aspect | Sinopec | [[CNPC]] |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Focus | Downstream (refining) | Upstream (production) |
| Refining | Larger | Smaller |
| E&P | Smaller | Larger |
| Venezuela exposure | Lower | Higher |

## Relevance to US refiners

**If Venezuela crude flows to US instead of China:**

- Sinopec loses feedstock option
- [[Valero]], [[PBF Energy]] gain cheap heavy crude
- Gulf Coast refiners = natural destination
