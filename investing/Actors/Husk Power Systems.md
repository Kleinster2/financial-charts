## Why Husk matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Type | Solar minigrid operator |
| Position | **#1 globally** |
| Nigeria systems | ~70 |
| Fundraise | $400M (ongoing) |
| Markets | Nigeria, [[India]] |
| CEO | Manoj Sinha (co-founder) |

## Business model

**Solar minigrids for off-grid communities:**
- Harness solar to power small communities
- Serve areas not connected to grid or with erratic supply
- Replace diesel generators

**Manoj Sinha:** "When we stepped into a village, we could smell a waft of diesel hanging in the air. Now you can drink chilled beer after a hot afternoon, you can process rice that doesn't smell like diesel when it's heated."

## Geographic footprint

| Market | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Nigeria** | ~70 systems, expanding |
| **[[India]]** | Active, part of $400M expansion |
| Tanzania | **Exited 2022** (unfavorable pricing regulations) |

**Tanzania exit:** Government edict required minigrid operators to charge same rates as subsidized utilities — uneconomic.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Global minigrid leader
- Nigeria market size (237M people, 90M without power)
- World Bank Mission 300 tailwind ($750M for [[Africa]] solar)
- [[Diesel]] replacement = clear value proposition

**Bear:**
- Regulatory risk (Tanzania precedent)
- Currency risk in EM markets
- Competition from pay-as-you-go models (Sun King)
