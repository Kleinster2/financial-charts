## Lithium & critical minerals

In Feb 2023, the [[Geological Survey of India]] announced 5.9 million tonnes of inferred [[Lithium]] resources in the Salal-Haimana area of Reasi district, [[Jammu and Kashmir]] — India's first major lithium find. Additional deposits identified in Mandya ([[Karnataka]]), Degana ([[Rajasthan]]), and Katghora ([[Chhattisgarh]]).

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reasi resource | 5.9Mt inferred (G3 stage) |
| Exploration status | G2 stage targeted for completion Jan 2026 |
| Auction attempts | 2 failed (Nov 2023, Jul 2024) — no bidders due to insufficient data |
| Other sites | Karnataka (~1,600t), Rajasthan (Degana), Chhattisgarh (Katghora) |

Challenges:
- G3 = inferred only — needs G2/G1 upgrade before commercial viability is clear
- Reasi is remote, mountainous terrain — infrastructure gap
- Two failed auctions signal industry skepticism on grade/extractability
- India imports ~100% of lithium needs; even if viable, years from production
- [[China battery leverage]] persists — India still depends on Chinese lithium processing

## US-India trade deal (Feb 2026)

India secured an interim tariff reduction from 50% to 18% by partially opening its ~$580B agriculture sector to US imports.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tariff (old → new) | 50% → 18% (interim deal) |
| Agriculture sector size | ~$580B (McKinsey) |
| Seed oil imports | 16M tons/year |
| Products opened | DDGS, red sorghum, soybean oil, tree nuts, fruit |
| Products excluded | Dairy, poultry, raw soybeans, GM food crops |

Nuances:
- DDGS (distillers' dried grains with solubles) is a GM corn byproduct — India technically allows it as animal feed while banning GM food crops directly
- Farmer lobby is politically powerful — Modi risks backlash from rural constituencies
- India already imports ~70% of edible oil needs — opening soybean oil formalizes existing dependency on US/Argentina/Brazil
- US pushed hard on dairy and poultry but India held firm — religious and political sensitivity

Implications:
- Positive for [[Trump II]] bilateral relationship — deal structure avoids full confrontation
- Opens door for deeper [[EU-India FTA]] negotiations (EU watching US concessions)
- Agricultural commodity importers ([[Adani Group]], ITC) may benefit from formalized channels
- Risk: if US demands escalate, India's concession space narrows further

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| [[Trump II]] tariffs | Reduced to 18% from 50% (Feb 2026 interim deal) — agri concessions required |
| [[India sectors]] | Can't build batteries, EVs domestically — lithium finds years from production |
| [[Indian rupee]] | Persistent depreciation |
| Real estate | Construction slowdown — see [[India macro]] |

## AI strategy

India is betting on **application-led innovation** over frontier model development. India's Economic Survey (Jan 2026) urged focus on large-scale deployment rather than chasing mega-models. No globally dominant frontier AI model yet — competitive edge is scale of deployment + talent. India ranked **3rd globally** in Stanford's 2025 Global AI Index.

**Three pillars: infrastructure, users, talent.**

### Infrastructure

- **$70B in DC spending** already in early execution stages (tech minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Feb 2026)
- [[Google]]: **$15B** in southeastern India DCs (Oct 2025)
- [[Microsoft]]: **$17.5B** (largest-ever Asia investment) for cloud/AI infra (Dec 2025)
- [[Amazon]]: **$35B** across India operations over 5 years (Dec 2025)
- [[Adani Group]]: **$100B** AI data centers with renewable energy by 2035 (announced at [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]])
- India approved **$18B** in semiconductor projects to build domestic chip supply chain
- **$1.1B** earmarked for state-backed VC fund targeting AI and advanced manufacturing startups
- New Indian data localization rules helped attract foreign investment
- India accounts for a tiny share of $226B in global AI VC funding (CB Insights, 2025)
- US has 75% and China 15% of AI supercomputing clusters ([[Epoch AI]])

### Users

- 100M+ weekly [[ChatGPT]] users ([[Sam Altman]], Feb 2026) — India is [[OpenAI]]'s #2 market after the US, largest student user base globally
- India is [[Anthropic]]'s 2nd largest market for [[Claude]] after the US
- No major domestic chatbot rival — US labs competing for users and training data via free tiers
- Sovereign LLM push: [[Sarvam AI]] and [[IIT Bombay]]-led **BharatGen** developing sovereign LLMs

### Talent

- 60%+ of Global Capability Centers (GCCs) established in last 2 years focused on AI/data/digital engineering
- 80%+ of GCCs expected in next 6–8 months will be AI-led
- "Chief AI Officer" roles increasingly being created in India (ANSR)
- [[Tech Mahindra]] CTO: India is an "AI talent factory"

### Frugal AI model

India positioning its approach — affordable, localized AI tools — as a blueprint for the developing world. Government subsidizes compute access (under $1/hour for startups/researchers from a pool of AI chips). Key example: **Adalat AI**, trained on Indian case law and fluent in Indian languages, recording witness depositions and producing hearing records in thousands of courts — solving the 50M pending cases backlog. Adalat AI CTO Arghya Bhattacharya: "You don't need large models. You need models smaller and customized for every setting." [[Anthropic]] opened India office and is partnering with Adalat AI to provide case updates via [[Claude]] in local languages. Adalat AI also accessed [[Microsoft]] grants for supercomputing power housed in India.

### IT services disruption risks

- India's $283B IT sector faces AI disruption — [[Jefferies]] predicts call centres could face **50% revenue hit** by 2030
- [[Vinod Khosla]]: IT services and BPOs "can almost completely disappear within five years"
- HCL CEO: Indian IT companies "will focus on turning profits and not being job creators"
- Indian IT stocks dipping on AI disruption fears

### Geopolitical AI context

Previous AI summits: Bletchley Park (UK, 2023), Seoul (2024), Paris (2025) — focused on safety commitments and voluntary pledges, criticized for producing few enforceable outcomes. India positioning itself as voice of the developing world in AI governance via the [[India AI Impact Summit 2026]].

Chip access as geopolitical tool — US controls 75% of AI supercomputing clusters, China 15% ([[Epoch AI]]). India's relationship with the US on chip access is critical to its AI ambitions.
