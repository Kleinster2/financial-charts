## Lithium & critical minerals

In Feb 2023, the [[Geological Survey of India]] announced 5.9 million tonnes of inferred [[Lithium]] resources in the Salal-Haimana area of Reasi district, [[Jammu and Kashmir]] — India's first major lithium find. Additional deposits identified in Mandya ([[Karnataka]]), Degana ([[Rajasthan]]), and Katghora ([[Chhattisgarh]]).

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reasi resource | 5.9Mt inferred (G3 stage) |
| Exploration status | G2 stage targeted for completion Jan 2026 |
| Auction attempts | 2 failed (Nov 2023, Jul 2024) — no bidders due to insufficient data |
| Other sites | Karnataka (~1,600t), Rajasthan (Degana), Chhattisgarh (Katghora) |

**Challenges:**
- G3 = inferred only — needs G2/G1 upgrade before commercial viability is clear
- Reasi is remote, mountainous terrain — infrastructure gap
- Two failed auctions signal industry skepticism on grade/extractability
- India imports ~100% of lithium needs; even if viable, years from production
- [[China battery leverage]] persists — India still depends on Chinese lithium processing
