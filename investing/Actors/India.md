## Why India matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GDP | ~$3.9T (#5 globally) |
| Population | 1.4B (#1) |
| Growth | ~6.5% (fastest major economy) |
| PM | Narendra Modi (BJP) |

## Macro outlook — Jan 2026

**Arvind Subramanian (former Chief Economic Adviser):** GDP 7.4% figure "should be read cautiously."

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Deflator issues | Unusually low, may overstate real growth |
| Nominal indicators | Decelerating |
| High-frequency data | Slowing |
| Trade deal | "Looking less likely," tariffs may rise |
| Chinese dumping | "Mercantilism" — low-cost goods flooding India |
| Fiscal position | Weaker than should be (GST cuts) |
| [[Indian rupee]] | -5% past year, past 91/$ |
| RBI | Intervention "above what is needed" |

**Quote:** "If growth next year ends up similar to this year, India should consider itself fortunate."

### Reserve diversification — Treasuries → Gold

![[india-treasuries-vs-gold-reserves.png]]

| Metric | Peak | Current | Change |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| US Treasury holdings | ~$235B (2023 peak) | **$174B** (five-year low) | **-26%** |
| Treasuries as % of FX reserves | 40% (year prior) | **33%** | -7pp |
| Gold in FX reserves | ~$25B (2019) | **~$100B** (2025) | ~4x |

**Dual motivation:**
1. **Rupee defense** — selling Treasuries funds rupee purchases (record lows after 50% tariffs, stalled trade deal)
2. **Sanctions risk** — post-2022 Russia freeze + India's continued Russian oil purchases made it a target

Finance Minister Sitharaman confirmed (Sep 2025) RBI taking a "very considered decision" to diversify.

**Context:** India holds $174B vs China ~$683B and Japan ~$1.2T. Not a major holder, but the trend matters — OMFIF survey (Nov 2025) found ~60% of central banks plan to seek alternatives to dollar in next 1-2 years. China and Brazil also cut long-term holdings to record lows (Oct 2025).

**Outlook:** Pepperstone's Michael Brown: even a trade deal will only stabilize holdings, not reverse the trend. Capital Economics (top rupee forecaster): speed of US-India deterioration "jolted policymakers to reduce vulnerabilities."

## US-India relations

### Trump tariffs

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 50% tariff on Indian goods | Pushed India toward China |
| Rationale | "Stop buying Russian oil" |
| Trade deal | Mixed signals, uncertain |

**Unintended consequence:** Tariffs driving India-China rapprochement.

See [[Propaganda thru Force]] — tariffs as political pressure.

### Strategic partnership

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Quad member | US, Japan, India, Australia |
| Defense ties | Growing arms purchases |
| Tech partnership | Chip manufacturing interest |
| Tensions | Tariffs, Russia oil, Pakistan |

---

## India-China relations

See [[India-China relations]] for full analysis.

**Current status (Jan 2026):** Thawing.

| Development | Date |
|-------------|------|
| Modi China visit | 2024 (first in 7 years) |
| Direct flights resumed | 2024 |
| Business visas streamlined | 2024 |
| Govt contract curbs lifting | Jan 2026 (planned) |

**Trigger:** US tariffs + US-Pakistan warming pushed India toward China.

### 2020 restrictions — partial rollback

Post-Galwan clash restrictions now being selectively lifted:

| Restriction | 2020 | 2026 status |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Chinese firms barred from govt contracts | $700-750B blocked | Lifting for some sectors |
| Registration + security clearance | Effective ban | Streamlined |
| Power equipment curbs | Thermal bottleneck | Partially relaxed |

**Reality check:** Despite thaw, China tech transfer still blocked (see [[China battery leverage]]). Rapprochement is transactional, not strategic.

## India Semiconductor Mission

**Status (Jan 23, 2026):** First commercial production in 2026. Electronics Minister Vaishnaw announced from Veldhoven (ASML HQ).

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mission launched | January 2022 |
| Plants starting 2026 | **4** |
| Pilot production | 3 plants (started 2025) |
| Total investment | **$90B** (rising to $150B committed) |
| Key partners | ASML, Tata Electronics, CG Power |

**Assessment:** Ambitious timeline but primarily assembly/packaging (28nm+). No advanced logic manufacturing planned. Focused on reducing import dependence for legacy chips (auto, industrial, consumer). Does not solve leading-edge gap.

## Key sectors

| Sector | Status | Constraint |
|--------|--------|------------|
| IT services | TCS, Infosys, Wipro — global leaders | Talent retention |
| Pharma | Generic drug powerhouse | API dependence on China |
| Infrastructure | Massive buildout | Execution, funding |
| Semiconductors | India Semiconductor Mission — 4 fabs, 2026 start | Legacy nodes only |
| Power | 307 GW thermal target | Chinese equipment dependency |
| Manufacturing | "Make in India" | Tech transfer blocked (see above) |
| Defense | [[Indian Defense Industry]] | Import dependence |

---

## Technology dependence on China

India's industrial ambitions are constrained by dependence on Chinese technology and low domestic R&D.

### R&D gap — 27 years of stagnation

![[india-china-rd-gap.png]]

| Metric | India | China |
|--------|-------|-------|
| R&D as % GDP (1996) | ~0.6% | ~0.6% |
| R&D as % GDP (2023) | ~0.6% | ~2.5% |
| Trend | **Flat for 27 years** | 4x growth |

### "Make in India" battery failure

| Metric | Plan | Reality |
|--------|------|---------|
| Subsidy pool | ₹181B ($2B) | — |
| Capacity target | 50 GWh | **1 GWh installed** |
| Timeline | By 2027 | 2% of target |
| Companies affected | Reliance, Adani, JSW | All pivoted to assembly |

**Why it failed:** Chinese tech licensing blocked by Beijing. Japanese/European/Korean alternatives 30-50% more expensive — uncompetitive at scale. See [[China battery leverage]].

### Battery imports

![[india-battery-imports.png]]

| Year | Total imports | From China |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 2018 | ~$0.4B | ~75% |
| 2025 | **$3B** | **75%** ($2.2B) |

Imports grew **2.5x** while domestic manufacturing failed to scale.

### Rare earth / magnet concerns

India announced $800M in subsidies for domestic permanent magnet production. Skeptics note:
- Significant coastal reserves exist but minimal mining
- For decades, state miner sold output to Japan (not domestic use)
- China controls 90% of rare earth processing
- Some critical minerals India doesn't have in extractable quantities

## Key companies

| Company | Ticker | Sector |
|---------|--------|--------|
| [[Reliance Industries]] | RELIANCE.NS | Conglomerate |
| [[HDFC Bank]] | HDFCBANK.NS | Banking |
| [[Infosys]] | INFY | IT services |
| [[Larsen & Toubro]] | LART.NS | Infrastructure |
| [[BHEL]] | BHEL.NS | Power equipment |
| [[Tata Group]] | Various | Conglomerate |

---

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression | Caveat |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Infrastructure boom | [[Larsen & Toubro]], cement, steel | Execution risk |
| China+1 manufacturing | Electronics, pharma | Limited to assembly |
| Digital / IT services | TCS, Infosys, [[Reliance Industries]] | Talent competition |
| [[India AI]] | Compute buildout, talent | Behind US/China |

**What doesn't work:** Capital-intensive manufacturing requiring tech transfer (batteries, EVs, semiconductors). See tech dependence section above.

## Real estate sector stress — Jan 2026

BSE Realty Index down **>30%** from June 2024 peak. Oberoi Realty missed Q3 FY26 forecasts (sales, profit, residential margins) → sector-wide selloff.

![[india-construction-completions.png]]

**Core problem:** Builders launching projects but failing to complete them.

| Metric | FY 2017 | FY 2026 (Q1) |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Marketable supply | 3.3M sq ft | 3.6M sq ft |
| Completions | 2.4M sq ft (74%) | 2.0M sq ft (**57%**) |

Slower construction → delayed revenue recognition, higher execution risk, potential defaults (Liases Foras, Nov 2025).

**Demand picture:**
- Unsold inventory: 19 months (lightest in 2.5 years) — not a glut problem
- Nationwide sales growth peaked
- $1M+ homes (Mumbai luxury) propping up market; middle-class affordability weakening
- White-collar wages pressured by AI + geopolitical uncertainty

**Supply constraints:**
- Delhi: air pollution construction bans
- Mumbai: environmental clearance delays
- Skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, carpenters) earning more in gig economy
- Women (11% of construction workforce) leaving for cash transfer programs

**Pre-sales model risk:** Builders collecting booking amounts before construction begins. If completions continue declining, buyer confidence in financially weaker developers could crack — echoing China's pre-sales crisis (though much smaller scale). China Vanke alone has $19B in presold properties pending delivery — nearly a quarter's worth of India's total residential sales.

**Not yet a crisis:** No liquidity crunch or systemic defaults. Fear has arrived, panic has not.
