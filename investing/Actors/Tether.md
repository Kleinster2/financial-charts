## Price history

![[usdt-price-chart.png]]
*Stablecoin — by design, the chart is boring. Peg holds at $1.00 with occasional stress spikes (COVID Mar 2020 depeg to ~$0.97, brief wobble during Terra/Luna collapse May 2022). Tighter peg maintenance since 2023.*

## How it works

Tether issues USDT tokens on 10+ blockchains ([[Ethereum]], [[Tron]], [[Solana]], BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, others). Users deposit USD, receive USDT. Redemptions require minimum $100K and KYC. Tether invests the reserves — primarily in short-duration US Treasuries — and retains all yield. At ~$187B in circulation with T-bill yields of 4-5%, the math is straightforward.

[[Tron]] historically carries the largest share of USDT transfers due to low fees. Sub-$1,000 transfers account for 88.2% of all transactions — USDT functions as dollar access for emerging markets, not just crypto trading.

## Reserve composition (Q4 2025 attestation)

| Category | Amount | % of reserves |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| US Treasuries (direct + indirect) | $141.6B | ~73% |
| Physical gold | ~$24B (128-140 metric tons) | ~12% |
| Secured loans | ~$14.6B | ~8% |
| [[Bitcoin]] | 96,184 BTC (~$10B) | ~5% |
| Other investments | ~$3.9B | ~2% |
| Total reserves | $192.9B | |
| Total liabilities (tokens) | ~$186.6B | |
| Excess buffer | $6.3B | |

Treasury exposure has grown rapidly: $98B (mid-2024) to $142B (Q4 2025). Tether now ranks as the 17th-largest holder of US government debt globally, ahead of [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], and [[Australia]].

Commercial paper — once a major concern — has been fully eliminated from reserves.

## Financials

| Year | Net profit | Key drivers |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 2023 | $6.2B | Treasury yields, stablecoin growth |
| 2024 | $13B | $7B Treasuries/repos, $5B unrealized BTC/gold gains |
| 2025 | $10B+ | Smaller unrealized gains offset by continued Treasury income |

Q4 2024 alone generated $6B. Q2 2025 was a record $4.9B quarter. For context, 2024 profit of $13B rivals [[Goldman Sachs]] — from a company with ~100 employees.

## Controversies and regulatory history

### CFTC settlement (Oct 2021) — $41M fine
CFTC found Tether held sufficient fiat reserves to back USDT for only 27.6% of the days in a 26-month period (2016-2018). Reserves were commingled with [[Bitfinex]] operational funds. At least 29 third-party holding arrangements were undocumented.

### NYAG settlement (Feb 2021) — $18.5M fine
NY AG found Tether and Bitfinex overstated reserves and hid ~$850M in losses (linked to payment processor Crypto Capital). Starting no later than mid-2017, Tether had no access to banking anywhere in the world and for periods held no reserves backing USDT at all. The day after publicizing a "verification" of cash reserves at [[Deltec Bank]], Tether began transferring hundreds of millions out to Bitfinex.

### Never audited
Tether publishes quarterly attestations by BDO — not audits. An attestation verifies specific figures at a point in time; an audit examines controls, processes, and the full picture. Despite years of promises, a full independent audit has never been completed.

### Ownership concentration
Fewer than 10 people control the vast majority of equity. [[Giancarlo Devasini]] (~40-47%), [[Paolo Ardoino]] (~20%), and a handful of others. Corporate structure is deliberately opaque — [[Bitfinex]] owned by iFinex (Hong Kong), Tether owned by DigiFinex (Singapore), entities share mutual shareholders.

---

## Regulatory status

### EU — MiCA ban
Tether refused to comply with [[MiCA]] (CEO Ardoino called the 60%-in-European-banks reserve requirement "dangerous"). USDT was delisted from all major EU-regulated exchanges by Jul 2025 — [[Crypto.com]], [[Bitstamp]], [[Binance]], [[Kraken]] all removed USDT spot pairs for EEA users. Decentralized exchanges unaffected.

### US — GENIUS Act (Jul 2025)
Federal stablecoin framework requiring 100% liquid reserves, BSA/AML compliance, monthly disclosures, mandatory audits. Rather than bring USDT into compliance, Tether launched USAT — a separate federally regulated stablecoin issued through [[Anchorage Digital Bank]] with [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] as reserve custodian. [[Bo Hines]] (former White House Crypto Council head) serves as USAT CEO.

### Cantor Fitzgerald nexus
[[Cantor Fitzgerald]] holds a convertible bond giving it 5% equity rights (purchased for >$600M). [[Howard Lutnick]] (former Cantor CEO, current Commerce Secretary) creates a significant political connection and potential conflict of interest.

## Competitive landscape

| Stablecoin | Issuer | Market cap | Key differentiator |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| USDT | Tether | ~$187B | Liquidity, 60% share, emerging market adoption |
| USDC | [[Circle]] | ~$75B | MiCA-compliant, GENIUS Act-compliant, audited reserves |
| DAI/USDS | [[MakerDAO]] | ~$3.6B | Crypto-collateralized, decentralized |
| FDUSD | First Digital | ~$1.5B | HKMA-aligned, Asia-focused |
| PYUSD | [[PayPal]]/Paxos | ~$870M | PayPal ecosystem integration |

USDC grew 73% in 2025 vs USDT's 36%. [[Circle]]'s regulatory compliance is its primary edge — USDC is the institutional favorite while USDT dominates retail, emerging markets, and offshore trading.

## Bull case

| Thesis | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Dollar access infrastructure | 534M MAU; 88% of transactions sub-$1K; de facto dollar for emerging markets |
| Profit machine | $10-13B/yr from ~100 employees; pure yield capture on reserves |
| Network effects | 80% of CEX spot volume; 71% of stablecoin wallets; deeply embedded in crypto plumbing |
| Treasury alignment | 17th-largest US debt holder; generates demand for Treasuries in a high-issuance environment |

## Bear case

| Risk | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Never audited | Attestations only; history of misrepresenting reserves (CFTC, NYAG findings) |
| Regulatory fragmentation | Banned in EU; creating parallel US product rather than bringing USDT into compliance |
| Concentration risk | <10 people control entity; opaque corporate structure across multiple jurisdictions |
| Reserve illiquidity | BTC, gold, secured loans (~25% of reserves) may not be immediately liquidatable in a rapid-redemption scenario |
| USDC gaining share | Compliance-first approach winning institutional and regulated exchange adoption |
| Political exposure | [[Howard Lutnick]] / [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] nexus creates conflict-of-interest risk |
