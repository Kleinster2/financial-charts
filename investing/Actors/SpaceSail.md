# SpaceSail

[[China]]'s state-backed LEO satellite internet constellation, directly competing with [[Starlink]]. Controlled by the **Shanghai municipal government** through Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST). Part of the broader "Qianfan" (千帆, "Thousand Sails") program.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Owner | Shanghai municipal government + Chinese Academy of Sciences | WIRED, Reuters |
| Founded | March 2018 (Shanghai) | YouTube transcription |
| Funding | $933M round (Feb 2024), led by China National Manufacturing Transformation Fund | YouTube transcription |
| Satellite manufacturer | Genesat (JV: Academy of Innovation for Microsatellites + SSST) | YouTube transcription |
| Satellites (current) | 108 in operation (as of Oct 2025, 6 launches) | YouTube transcription |
| Phase 1 target | 648 satellites (end 2025) — regional coverage | YouTube transcription |
| Phase 2 target | 1,296 satellites (end 2027) — global coverage begins | YouTube transcription |
| Phase 3 target | **15,000 satellites (2030)** | Reuters |
| Starlink comparison | ~7,000 current / 42,000 target by 2030 | Reuters |
| Launch vehicle | Long March 6A (18 sats/mission, ~700km altitude, expendable) | YouTube transcription |

## Technical specs

| Spec | SpaceSail | Starlink (comparison) |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Download speed | 100-500 Mbps | 50-250 Mbps (typical) |
| Upload speed | 20-50 Mbps | 10-20 Mbps (typical) |
| Latency | 20-60 ms | 20-40 ms |
| Orbital altitude | ~700 km | ~550 km |
| Frequency bands | KU, Q, V | KU, KA |
| Antenna type | Phased array (no moving parts) | Phased array |
| Terminal kit | Compact antenna + Wi-Fi 6 router | Dishy McFlatface + router |

The Q and V bands offer higher bandwidth capacity than Starlink's early KU-only phases, though they're more susceptible to rain/atmospheric interference.

**Beyond residential:** SpaceSail is developing connectivity for ships/aircraft (tested Jan 2025), Direct-to-Device (smartphone connection without cell towers), and IoT solutions (agricultural monitoring, power grids, disaster communications).

## The play

SpaceSail is China's answer to Starlink — providing satellite broadband internet globally, targeting markets where Western alternatives dominate or where governments want a non-US option for strategic reasons.

Key differentiator: **state backing**. Unlike Starlink (private, dependent on SpaceX economics), SpaceSail has $933M+ in state-directed funding and can price below cost to win market share. This mirrors China's approach in 5G ([[Huawei]]), undersea cables ([[Chile-China Express]]), and ports — subsidized infrastructure as a geopolitical wedge.

## Market strategy

SpaceSail is targeting the Global South — countries where:
1. **Internet connectivity gaps** create real demand (rural Brazil, Southeast Asia, Africa)
2. **Governments want alternatives to US-controlled infrastructure** for sovereignty reasons
3. **Starlink's relationship with Elon Musk** creates political friction (Brazil's Lula government clashed with Musk over X/Twitter)

### Brazil (flagship market)

SpaceSail received **Anatel license on February 12, 2026** — 324 satellites authorized for immediate operation, valid until July 2031, with 2-year deadline to start commercial service and obligation to have 10%+ of authorized fleet active.

**Timeline:**
- **H1 2026**: Public sector first — internet for schools and hospitals in remote areas via [[Telebras]]/GESAC digital inclusion program (per Casa Civil minister Rui Costa)
- **Q4 2026**: Commercial residential launch

**Pricing disruption:** Starlink currently holds **46% of Brazil's satellite market**. Residential plans cost R$184-235/month (~$35-45) + R$1,000-2,000 equipment (~$190-380). SpaceSail is expected to undercut aggressively with:
- State-subsidized equipment kits
- Aggressive installment plans (parcelamento)
- Social plans via Telebras at reduced cost for schools/clinics
- PIX payment integration, WhatsApp-based customer support

Analysts expect SpaceSail's entry to force **both companies' prices down** to levels approaching urban fiber optic pricing.

**Sovereignty angle:** Brazil explicitly values having a non-American satellite option. The Telebras MOU includes clauses on Brazilian data sovereignty and LGPD compliance. In case of US-Brazil diplomatic tensions, Brazil would have operational redundancy — relevant given Lula's exclusion from the [[Trump Latin America Summit (March 2026)|March 7 Miami summit]] and the Musk/Lula X/Twitter clashes.

Per Reuters: "Few of Musk's international rivals have the same ambition as SpaceSail."

### Other markets
- **Malaysia**: deal signed
- **Thailand**: deal signed
- **Targeting**: dozens of additional markets across Asia, Africa, Latin America

## Competitive landscape

| Constellation | Operator | Satellites (current) | Target | Status |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------|--------|
| [[Starlink]] | SpaceX (US) | ~7,000 | 42,000 | Dominant, 4M+ subscribers |
| SpaceSail/Qianfan | Shanghai govt (China) | ~100+ | 15,000 | Early deployment |
| Guowang | China SatNet (state) | Planned | 13,000 | Earlier stage |
| [[Amazon]] Kuiper | Amazon (US) | Testing | 3,236 | Behind schedule |
| OneWeb | Eutelsat (EU) | ~600 | 648 | Operational, niche |

China has **two** competing constellations — SpaceSail (Shanghai, commercially oriented, export-focused) and Guowang (central government, domestic/military). Together they'd total 28,000 satellites.

## Investment implications

**For Starlink/SpaceX:**
- SpaceSail is the first credible challenger to Starlink's global monopoly on LEO satellite internet
- State-subsidized pricing could compress Starlink margins in competitive markets
- Geopolitical fragmentation risk — some countries may choose SpaceSail for sovereignty reasons even if technically inferior

**Broader:**
- Satellite internet is becoming a geopolitical battleground, like 5G and submarine cables before it
- The "China infrastructure vs US infrastructure" dynamic extends to space
- Companies providing ground equipment, terminals, and spectrum management benefit regardless of who wins
