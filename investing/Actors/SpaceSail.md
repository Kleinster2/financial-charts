# SpaceSail

[[China]]'s state-backed LEO satellite internet constellation, directly competing with [[Starlink]]. Controlled by the **Shanghai municipal government** through Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST). Part of the broader "Qianfan" (千帆, "Thousand Sails") program.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Shanghai municipal government |
| Satellites (current) | ~100+ (early deployment phase) |
| 2025 target | 648 LEO satellites |
| 2030 target | **15,000** satellites |
| Starlink comparison | 7,000 current / 42,000 target by 2030 |
| Markets | Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand + dozens more in Asia, Africa, Latin America |
| Status | Operational testing, commercial service launching 2026 |

## The play

SpaceSail is China's answer to Starlink — providing satellite broadband internet globally, targeting markets where Western alternatives dominate or where governments want a non-US option for strategic reasons.

Key differentiator: **state backing**. Unlike Starlink (private, dependent on SpaceX economics), SpaceSail has Shanghai government funding and can price below cost to win market share. This mirrors China's approach in 5G ([[Huawei]]), undersea cables ([[Chile-China Express]]), and ports — subsidized infrastructure as a geopolitical wedge.

## Market strategy

SpaceSail is targeting the Global South — countries where:
1. **Internet connectivity gaps** create real demand (rural Brazil, Southeast Asia, Africa)
2. **Governments want alternatives to US-controlled infrastructure** for sovereignty reasons
3. **Starlink's relationship with Elon Musk** creates political friction (Brazil's Lula government clashed with Musk over X/Twitter)

### Brazil deal (Dec 2025)
Partnered with **Telebras** (state-owned telecom) to provide satellite internet starting 2026. This is strategically significant — Brazil is Latin America's largest economy, and Starlink already has major operations there. SpaceSail is entering Starlink's largest international market with state-backed pricing.

Per Reuters: "Few of Musk's international rivals have the same ambition as SpaceSail."

### Other markets
- **Malaysia**: deal signed
- **Thailand**: deal signed
- **Targeting**: dozens of additional markets across Asia, Africa, Latin America

## Competitive landscape

| Constellation | Operator | Satellites (current) | Target | Status |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------|--------|
| [[Starlink]] | SpaceX (US) | ~7,000 | 42,000 | Dominant, 4M+ subscribers |
| SpaceSail/Qianfan | Shanghai govt (China) | ~100+ | 15,000 | Early deployment |
| Guowang | China SatNet (state) | Planned | 13,000 | Earlier stage |
| [[Amazon]] Kuiper | Amazon (US) | Testing | 3,236 | Behind schedule |
| OneWeb | Eutelsat (EU) | ~600 | 648 | Operational, niche |

China has **two** competing constellations — SpaceSail (Shanghai, commercially oriented, export-focused) and Guowang (central government, domestic/military). Together they'd total 28,000 satellites.

## Investment implications

**For Starlink/SpaceX:**
- SpaceSail is the first credible challenger to Starlink's global monopoly on LEO satellite internet
- State-subsidized pricing could compress Starlink margins in competitive markets
- Geopolitical fragmentation risk — some countries may choose SpaceSail for sovereignty reasons even if technically inferior

**Broader:**
- Satellite internet is becoming a geopolitical battleground, like 5G and submarine cables before it
- The "China infrastructure vs US infrastructure" dynamic extends to space
- Companies providing ground equipment, terminals, and spectrum management benefit regardless of who wins
