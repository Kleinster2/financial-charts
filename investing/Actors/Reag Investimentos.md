## João Carlos Mansur — the founder

Founder of Reag group. Targeted in second phase of Operation Compliance Zero (January 14, 2026) but was not in Brazil at the time of raids.

**Prior issues:** Reag previously faced enforcement actions related to alleged fuel-sector money laundering (denied wrongdoing). Under pressure, divested business segments and surrendered distinctive São Paulo headquarters.

## The scheme

Reag funds served as the laundering mechanism for Banco Master's fraudulent loans:

```
Banco Master issues fictitious loans
    → 36 shell companies receive R$11.5B
        → Shell companies "invest" in Besc cártulas via Reag funds
            → Reag marks up assets to fabricated valuations
                → Money extracted through fund redemptions
```

### The 36 shell companies

| Characteristic | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| Average loan | R$288M |
| Smallest loan | R$57M |
| Largest loan | R$449M (Brain Realty Consultoria e Participações) |
| Typical profile | Small, recently established, minimal capitalization |
| Equity | Some under R$1,000 |
| Industries | Construction, food, hospitality, import/export |

### Reag funds involved

| Fund | Role |
|------|------|
| **FIDC High Tower** | Primary vehicle — purchased cártulas at R$850M, marked up to R$10.8B |
| **D Mais** | Primary vehicle |
| **Bravo** | Primary vehicle |
| **Astralo 95** | Secondary vehicle |
| **Reag Growth 95** | Secondary vehicle |
| **Hans 95** | Secondary vehicle |
| **Maia 95** | Secondary vehicle |
| **Anna** | Secondary vehicle |

**Combined AUM of implicated funds:** R$102.4B (per Central Bank)

## The High Tower Fund — most egregious

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase price (Besc cártulas) | R$850M |
| Marked-up valuation | R$10.8B |
| Reported 2024 return | **10,502,205.65%** |
| "Profit" generated | R$10.5B |
| Redemptions | R$6B |

A 10.5 million percent return is not a real return — it's accounting fraud via fictitious asset valuations.

### What are BESC cártulas?

**Cártulas** are physical share certificates from **Banco do Estado de Santa Catarina (BESC)** — a state bank absorbed by Banco do Brasil in September 2008 for R$685M.

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| BESC status | Defunct (absorbed 2008) |
| Real value | ~Zero |
| Liquidity | None — courts have ruled them unsuitable even as collateral |

**Why worthless:** The bank doesn't exist. The shares represent ownership of nothing. There is no market to sell them.

**The crude fraud:** Cártulas circulated between different Reag funds on the same day at different valuations — investigators called it a "grosseira" (crude) fraud based on simulated transactions. The timeframe was July 2023 to July 2024.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Pre-2025 | Reag faces fuel-sector money laundering allegations (denies) |
| 2024-2025 | Reag funds used to process Banco Master fictitious loans |
| Nov 17, 2025 | Banco Master liquidated |
| Jan 14, 2026 | Operation Compliance Zero Phase 2 — 42 warrants, Mansur targeted |
| Jan 15, 2026 | Central Bank liquidates CBSF (ex-Reag DTVM) |

## Why it matters

Reag shows how the [[Banco Master]] fraud required infrastructure beyond the bank itself:

| Role | Actor |
|------|-------|
| Loan originator | Banco Master |
| Political protection | Brasília network (Ciro Nogueira, Arthur Lira, BRB) |
| **Laundering vehicle** | **Reag funds** |
| Shell companies | 36 entities |
| Judicial cover | STF connections |

Without Reag's fund structure, Master couldn't have converted fictitious loans into extractable "profits." The 10.5M% return on High Tower is the smoking gun — no legitimate fund produces such returns.
