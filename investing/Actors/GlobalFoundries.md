**GlobalFoundries** — Third-largest foundry globally. Spun off from AMD in 2009. Exited leading-edge (<7nm) in 2018 to focus on mature/specialty nodes.

---

## Why it matters

GF occupies a strategic niche:
- **Not competing with [[TSMC]]** on leading edge
- Focus on automotive, IoT, RF, embedded — less cyclical than bleeding-edge
- US-headquartered foundry (national security angle)
- Malta, NY fab + Dresden, Germany + Singapore

---

## Strategic position

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Nodes | 12nm and above (mature) |
| Specialty | RF, embedded, automotive |
| Customers | AMD (legacy), Qualcomm, NXP, automotive |
| CHIPS Act | Received funding for US expansion |

---

## Competitive dynamics

- Competes with [[Samsung]] and [[TSMC]] on mature nodes
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] entering similar markets
- Benefits from [[CHIPS Act]] reshoring push

---

## Investment angle

- Less sexy than leading-edge but more defensible
- Automotive semiconductor demand secular tailwind
- US fab = geopolitical hedge vs [[Taiwan concentration risk]]
