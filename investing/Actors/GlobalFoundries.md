GlobalFoundries — Third-largest foundry globally. Spun off from AMD (2009). Focus on mature/specialty nodes (12nm+) — automotive, RF, IoT. Mubadala-controlled, US fabs.

---

## Why GlobalFoundries matters

GF occupies a strategic niche between leading-edge and commodity:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Position | \#3 foundry (after TSMC, Samsung) |
| Strategy | Mature nodes, specialty processes |
| Ownership | Mubadala (Abu Dhabi) ~85% |
| US presence | Malta NY fab — geopolitical value |

---

## Strategic decision: exit leading edge (2018)

Pivotal choice:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Exit <7nm | Couldn't compete with TSMC capex |
| Focus | 12nm and above |
| Specialty | RF, embedded flash, FD-SOI |
| Result | Profitable, less cyclical |

Avoided the Samsung trap of bleeding cash on leading-edge race.

---

## Product portfolio

Specialty processes:

| Technology | Applications |
|------------|--------------|
| RF-SOI | [[5G]], WiFi, radar |
| FD-SOI | IoT, automotive, low-power |
| Embedded flash | MCUs, automotive |
| SiGe | RF front-end |
| BCD | Power management |

---

## Manufacturing footprint

| Location | Nodes | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Malta, New York | 12nm-14nm | Flagship, CHIPS Act funding |
| Dresden, [[Germany]] | 22nm-28nm | Former AMD fab |
| Singapore | 40nm-65nm | Acquired from Chartered |

US fab = geopolitical asset — DoD supplier, CHIPS Act beneficiary.

---

## Key customers

| Customer | Products |
|----------|----------|
| AMD (legacy) | Older chip designs |
| [[Qualcomm]] | RF, connectivity |
| [[NXP]] | [[Automotive]] MCUs |
| [[Infineon]] | Specialty |
| [[Broadcom]] | RF |
| [[STMicro]] | Specialty |

Auto and RF are core verticals.

---

## [[Automotive]] focus

Sweet spot for auto semis:

| Advantage | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Mature nodes | Auto doesn't need 3nm |
| Specialty processes | Embedded flash, BCD |
| Quality | [[Automotive]]-grade certification |
| Long lifecycles | Auto chips run 10+ years |

Competes with tower Semiconductor, UMC, SMIC on mature auto nodes.

---

## CHIPS Act funding

US government support:

| Award | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Amount | ~$1.5B |
| Purpose | Malta fab expansion |
| Focus | Domestic capacity |
| National security | DoD supplier qualification |

GF is a key beneficiary of US reshoring push.

## Competitive position

| vs | GF advantage | GF disadvantage |
|----|--------------|-----------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Specialty processes, US presence | Scale, leading edge |
| [[Samsung]] | Profitability, focus | Advanced nodes |
| UMC | Technology breadth | Cost |
| SMIC | US/[[Europe]] accessible | [[China]] cost |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Specialty expertise | IFS scale ambitions |

## Mubadala ownership

Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | ~85% |
| Acquired | AMD spinoff (2009) |
| IPO | Oct 2021 |
| Control | Effective control despite public listing |

Mubadala provides patient capital — not forcing leading-edge race.

---

## Financial position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | GFS (NASDAQ) |
| Market cap | ~$25B |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$7B |
| Gross margin | ~25% |
| Capex | ~$1.5B/year |
| P/E | ~20x |
| Float | ~15% (Mubadala controls rest) |

---

## Investment implications

Bull case:
- Specialty node leader
- US fab = geopolitical premium
- CHIPS Act beneficiary
- [[Automotive]] secular growth
- Less cyclical than leading-edge

Bear case:
- Low float, Mubadala control
- Margin pressure from UMC, SMIC
- No leading-edge upside
- Auto semi cycle exposure

## Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 11, 2026)

Solid beat, strategic acquisitions, $500M buyback:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Revenue | $1,830M | At/above high end of guide |
| Gross margin | 27.8% / 29.0% (non-IFRS) | +400bps YoY (non-IFRS) |
| Net income | $200M | — |
| Non-IFRS EPS | $0.55 | — |
| Adj EBITDA | $641M | — |
| Adj FCF | $264M | — |

FY2025: Revenue $6.79B, net income $888M, adj FCF $1.16B.

Acquisitions:
- [[Advanced Micro Foundry]] — acquired
- Infinilink — acquired
- [[Synopsys]] ARC Processor IP — definitive agreement. Will integrate with [[MIPS]] (GFS company) for comprehensive processor IP suite targeting physical AI. Expected close H2 2026.

Capital return: $500M share repurchase authorized (12 months).

Q1 2026 guide: Revenue $1,625M ± $25M (seasonal decline). IFRS diluted EPS ~$0.23 ± $0.05.

Stock -3.7% — market may have wanted stronger forward guide.
