## Tesla contract collapse (Jan 2026)

**Original contract (2023):** $2.9 billion to supply cathode materials for Tesla's 4680 battery cells.

**Revised (Jan 2026):** Contract value reduced to **$7,386** — effectively cancelled.

| Metric | Original | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Contract value | $2.9B | $7,386 |
| Change | — | **-99.9997%** |
| Reason | — | "Change in supply quantity" |

**Implications:**
- Tesla's 4680 program has severely underperformed
- 4680 cells only used in Cybertruck (20-25K units/year vs 250K capacity)
- Signals potential failure of Tesla's in-house battery ambitions

---

## 4680 battery context

Tesla's 4680 cells were meant to:
- Standardize battery format industry-wide
- Deliver 54% increased range
- Enable a $25,000 EV

**Reality:** Only deployed in Cybertruck with weak sales. Other OEMs ([[BMW]], [[Rivian]]) adopting 46XX format independently.
