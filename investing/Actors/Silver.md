**Silver** — Precious and industrial metal. Dual demand from safe haven + solar panels. Up 150% in 2025, hit all-time high $93.75 (Jan 2026).

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price | ~$88/oz (after pullback) |
| All-time high | **$93.7515** (Jan 15, 2026) |
| 2025 return | **+150%** (outpaced gold) |
| Gold/silver ratio | ~52x (historically low) |
| Volatility | Extreme — 7.3% single-day drop |

**Record driver:** Supply shortfalls, solar demand, China speculation, tariff fears causing US warehouse hoarding.

**Jan 2026:** Hit record alongside gold and copper — geopolitical tension (US, [[Iran]], [[Venezuela]]) driving safe-haven flows. Silver miners benefiting from higher volatility magnifying gains.

## Price drivers

| Driver | Current status | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Solar demand** | Surging (panel production) | Structural bullish |
| **Supply deficit** | Multi-year shortfall | Bullish |
| **Gold spillover** | Rotation from expensive gold | Bullish |
| **China speculation** | Buying frenzy (Jan 2026) | Short-term bullish |
| **Tariff fears** | US warehouse hoarding | Squeeze dynamics |
| **Short squeeze** | 2025 squeeze continuing | Bullish |

## Industrial vs investment demand

**Silver's dual nature:**

| Demand type | % of total | Trend |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Industrial** | ~50% | Growing (solar, electronics) |
| **Investment** | ~25% | Surging (safe haven) |
| **Jewelry** | ~20% | Stable |
| **Silverware** | ~5% | Declining |

**Key difference from gold:** Silver has real industrial consumption, not just monetary/investment.

## Solar industry demand

**Silver in photovoltaics:**
- Used in solar panel contacts (conductivity)
- ~100mg per panel (varies by technology)
- Solar = largest industrial demand source
- [[China solar buildout]] = massive silver consumption

| Year | Solar silver demand |
|------|---------------------|
| 2020 | ~100M oz |
| 2023 | ~150M oz |
| 2025 | ~200M oz (est) |

**Risk:** Thrifting (less silver per panel) and substitution efforts.

---

## Supply constraints

**Structural deficit:**
- Mine supply ~800M oz/year
- Total demand ~1.2B oz/year
- Deficit covered by above-ground stocks
- Stocks depleting

**Mining dynamics:**
- 70% is byproduct (zinc, lead, copper, gold mines)
- Limited primary silver mines
- Supply inelastic to price

## 2025-2026 rally anatomy

| Phase | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| **2024 H2** | Gold rotation, solar demand |
| **2025 H1** | Short squeeze begins |
| **2025 H2** | Tariff fears → US warehouse hoarding |
| **2026 Jan** | China speculation + Fed fears → ATH |

**Jan 15, 2026:** Hit $93.75, then -7.3% profit-taking after Trump held off on critical mineral tariffs.

---

## Tariff/warehouse dynamics

**US hoarding:**
- Fears of import tariffs on critical minerals
- Silver held in US warehouses instead of exported
- Created artificial tightness globally
- Short squeeze dynamics

**Trump decision (Jan 2026):**
- Held off on broad tariffs
- Will negotiate bilateral agreements
- Price floors floated, not ruled out levies
- "More surgical approach" — TD Securities

## Volatility warning

**Ole Hansen (Saxo Bank):**
> "Much of what traders see on the screen reflects forced flows, margin dynamics, option hedging and short covering rather than genuine supply-demand price discovery. In this environment, technical levels lose reliability, stops are easily triggered, and even correct macro views struggle to survive short-term noise."

**14-day ATR:** Spiking — extreme volatility.

---

## Analyst views

**Christopher Wong (OCBC):**
> Medium-term narrative "firmly constructive, underpinned by supply shortfalls, industrial consumption and spillover demand from gold." But "velocity of recent moves warrants some near-term caution."

**Daniel Ghali (TD Securities):**
Trump's decision to hold off on tariffs "significantly alleviates the fear of a broad-based approach."
