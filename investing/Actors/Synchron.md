## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 2016 |
| Founder/CEO | Tom Oxley |
| HQ | Brooklyn, NY (US) / Melbourne (Australia) |
| Valuation | **~$1B** (Nov 2025) |
| Total raised | **$345M** |
| Patients implanted | **10** |
| Technology | Endovascular BCI (no open-brain surgery) |

---

## Why Synchron matters

**The less-invasive path to BCI.** While [[Neuralink]] requires craniotomy (opening the skull), Synchron's Stentrode is delivered through blood vessels via catheter — similar to a heart stent procedure. This dramatically reduces surgical risk and could enable broader adoption.

**First mover:** First human implant in 2019 (Australia). First US implant 2022. Now 10 patients across US/Australia trials.

## Stentrode technology

### How it works

1. **Insertion:** Catheter through jugular vein (no brain surgery)
2. **Placement:** Device lodges in motor cortex's draining vein
3. **Recording:** Reads brain signals through blood vessel wall
4. **Transmission:** Wireless signal to external devices
5. **Control:** Patient controls computers, phones, wheelchairs with thought

### Specs

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Insertion | Endovascular (catheter via jugular) |
| Surgery required | **No** (interventional radiology procedure) |
| Target | Motor cortex |
| Output | Wireless to digital devices |
| Procedure time | ~2 hours |

### Trade-offs vs invasive BCIs

| Aspect | Synchron | [[Neuralink]] |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Signal quality | Lower (through vessel wall) | Higher (direct brain contact) |
| Surgical risk | **Much lower** | Higher (craniotomy) |
| Channel count | Lower | 1,024 electrodes |
| Recovery time | Days | Weeks |
| Regulatory path | Potentially faster | More scrutiny |

## Clinical milestones

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2019 | First human implant (Melbourne, Australia) |
| 2022 | First US implant |
| Jul 2024 | OpenAI integration — hands-free AI chat |
| Mar 2025 | [[NVIDIA]] partnership for neural signal processing |
| Aug 2025 | Demonstrated iPad control |
| Nov 2025 | $200M Series D, ~$1B valuation |

## Product roadmap

**Current:** Motor cortex BCI for paralysis patients (cursor control, typing, device control).

**Next-gen (funded by Series D):**
- Multi-region brain access (not just motor cortex)
- Higher channel count
- Still endovascular (no surgery)

Tom Oxley: "We believe we have a breakthrough that is going to enable what no one thought possible — to deliver a nonsurgical, high channel count, whole brain device."

## Competitive position

| vs | Synchron advantage | Synchron weakness |
|----|-------------------|------------------|
| [[Neuralink]] | No brain surgery, lower risk | Lower signal quality, fewer channels |
| Blackrock | Less invasive, newer tech | Less clinical track record |
| Precision | Comparable invasiveness | Precision has FDA clearance |

**Strategic position:** May win the "good enough" market — patients and doctors willing to trade peak performance for dramatically lower surgical risk.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Only endovascular BCI with human trials
- Gates/Bezos validation
- NVIDIA/OpenAI partnerships signal platform potential
- Lower surgical risk = broader addressable market
- $1B valuation reasonable vs $9B Neuralink

**Bear:**
- Private (no public access)
- Signal quality may limit applications
- Neuralink's higher bandwidth could win if surgery becomes routine
- Regulatory path still uncertain
- Only 10 patients so far
