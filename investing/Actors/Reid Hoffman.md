## Epstein connection (2026 DOJ revelations)

### Role as introducer

|--------------|--------|
| [[Peter Thiel]] → Epstein | Led to $40M [[Valar Ventures]] investment |
| Mark Zuckerberg → Epstein | Formal intro after 2015 dinner |
| MIT Media Lab | Served on Advisory Board (2014-2021) via Joi Ito |

### Access and meetings

| Date | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 2015 | "Wild" dinner with Epstein, Musk, Zuckerberg, Thiel |
| Dec 2014 | Stayed overnight at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse |
| Dec 2014 | Breakfast party with Epstein and Bill Gates |
| 2016-2018 | 3 meetings + 3 Skype calls (per calendar entries) |

Also discussed visits to Epstein's island and New Mexico ranch.

### Timeline discrepancy

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| 2019 (Axios): "Last meeting was 2015" | Calendar showed meetings in 2016 and 2018 |
| 2026: Admitted "mistaken" | After DOJ documents contradicted him |

### Current status

- Trump administration ordered investigation into Hoffman's Epstein ties
- Multiple public apologies: "I helped repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice"
- No victim allegations against Hoffman personally
