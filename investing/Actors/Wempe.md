**Wempe** — [[Germany]]'s premier luxury watch and jewelry retailer, founded 1878 in Elsfleth. Family-owned across four generations, now led by [[Kim-Eva Wempe]] with fifth-generation successors entering in 2022. Revenue €652M (FY2023). Operates ~34 showrooms across Germany, the US, [[France]], [[Spain]], and Austria. Navigating a strategic pivot away from [[Rolex]] toward [[Patek Philippe]] after Rolex's [[Bucherer]] acquisition reshaped the competitive landscape.

## Quick stats

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 1878 |
| HQ | Hamburg, Germany |
| Structure | Private (GmbH & Co. KG) |
| Leader | Kim-Eva Wempe (4th gen, since 1994) |
| Revenue | €652.3M (FY2023) |
| Employees | ~750 |
| Stores | ~34 globally |
| Product mix | Watches 82%, jewelry 18% |
| Avg watch price | €11,367 |
| Own manufacture | Wempe Glashütte i/SA (~5,000 watches/yr) |

## Business

Wempe is both a multi-brand luxury retailer and a watch manufacturer. The retail network spans ~19 German locations and international flagships on Fifth Avenue (New York), in Paris, Madrid, and Vienna. The London Bond Street store closed March 2023 after losing the Rolex AD relationship.

Unique assets:
- [[Glashütte]] Observatory — acquired 2005, rebuilt into Germany's only independent chronometer testing institute (DIN 8319 standard). Certifies watches for external brands
- Marine chronometers — last remaining European manufacturer of mechanical ships' chronometers, inherited from the 1938 acquisition of Hamburger Chronometerwerke
- 150+ watchmakers — Europe's largest independent service workshop between Hamburg and Glashütte
- Pearl auctions — one of few jewelers worldwide permitted to bid at Tokyo's pearl auctions

Own brands:
- Wempe Glashütte i/SA — Chronometerwerke (in-house movements), Zeitmeister (Swiss movements regulated in Glashütte), Iron Walker (sport line, launched 2020)
- BY KIM — jewelry line designed by Kim-Eva Wempe, manufactured at L.C. Köhler Atelier in Schwäbisch Gmünd since 2003

## Rolex pivot

The Rolex-[[Bucherer]] acquisition (August 2023) fundamentally disrupted Wempe's business model. Rolex ended its 45-year relationship with Wempe's Fifth Avenue flagship — orders fulfilled through end of 2025. Rolex is building a 199,000 sq ft headquarters at 665 Fifth Avenue (David Chipperfield Architects, expected completion end of 2026) where Bucherer will likely operate the flagship retail space.

Response — Patek Philippe expansion:
- Fifth Avenue Patek showroom expanding from 600 to 1,600 sq ft (January 2026), one of the largest on the US East Coast
- Third major Patek boutique after Hamburg (2015, expanded 2022) and Frankfurt (2020)
- Wempe's Patek relationship dates to 1927

| Year | Revenue (€M) | YoY |

## Bull / Bear

Bull:
- Rare independent in a consolidating market — authenticity and heritage appeal
- Patek Philippe relationship deepening as Rolex exits independent retail
- Own manufacture + chronometer observatory = credibility no competitor can replicate
- Family continuity (5th generation) signals long-term stability

Bear:
- Private → no equity investment avenue
- Rolex departure removes highest-volume watch brand (was ~82% watches by revenue)
- Small store count limits scale advantages vs [[Watches of Switzerland]] or Bucherer
- Luxury watch demand cyclicality — FY2023 already showed softening
