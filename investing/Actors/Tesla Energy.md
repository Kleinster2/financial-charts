## Why Tesla Energy matters

Megapack is becoming the standard for grid-scale storage:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Product | Megapack (grid storage) |
| Parent | [[Tesla]] |
| Growth | Faster than auto segment |
| Position | Market leader (brand + scale) |

---

## Megapack

**Grid-scale battery storage:**
- 3.9 MWh per unit
- Modular, scalable
- Integrated inverter + thermal
- 2-hour+ duration configurations

**Megapack 2:**
- 60% more energy density
- Lower $/MWh
- Faster deployment

## Lathrop Megafactory

**Dedicated manufacturing:**
- Lathrop, California
- 40 GWh annual capacity target
- Megapack-only production
- Scaling rapidly

**Shanghai Megafactory:**
- China production
- Global supply
- Cost advantages

---

## AI data center relevance

**Storage enables renewable-powered data centers:**
- Solar + Megapack = 24/7 power
- Reduces grid interconnection needs
- Co-location deployments
- Hyperscaler demand growing

**Example deployments:**
- Utility-scale projects
- Behind-the-meter for large loads
- Renewable firming

---

## Growth trajectory

**Energy segment outpacing auto:**
- Energy storage deployments growing 100%+ YoY
- Higher margins than auto
- Less competition than EVs
- Becoming significant revenue

**Tesla's hidden asset:** Energy often overlooked vs auto hype.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Strength | Tesla vs |
|------------|----------|----------|
| [[Fluence]] | Enterprise, software | Brand, scale |
| BYD | Low cost | Non-China |
| Samsung SDI | Cells | Integration |
| CATL | Cells, cost | Brand, vertical |

Tesla = brand + manufacturing scale leader.
