# De Beers

The world's most famous diamond company and architect of the modern diamond market. Founded 1888 by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Currently 85% owned by [[Anglo American]], which announced a spinoff/sale in May 2024. De Beers invented the "A Diamond is Forever" campaign (1947), created artificial scarcity through its Central Selling Organisation, and controlled 80%+ of global rough diamond supply at peak.
