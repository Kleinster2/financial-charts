## Why Ajinomoto matters

Hidden semiconductor bottleneck inside a food company:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2802.T (Tokyo) |
| Market cap | ~¥3T (~$20B) |
| ABF share | ~90%+ |
| Semi revenue | ~5% of total |
| Main business | Food, amino acids |

## ABF (Ajinomoto Build-up Film)

**What it is:**
- Insulating film for IC substrates
- Goes between chip and PCB
- Enables high-density interconnects
- Critical for advanced packaging

**Why it matters:**
- ~90% market share
- No viable alternatives at scale
- Every GPU, CPU, AI chip needs it
- Capacity = bottleneck

## ABF supply chain

| Step | Player |
|------|--------|
| ABF film | **Ajinomoto** (monopoly) |
| Substrate fabrication | Ibiden, Shinko, Unimicron |
| Package assembly | [[ASE]], [[Amkor]] |
| Chip integration | [[TSMC]], [[Intel]] |

## Bottleneck history

**2020-2022 shortage:**
- ABF shortage constrained GPU supply
- NVIDIA, AMD affected
- Ajinomoto expanded capacity
- Still tight for AI chips

**Current status:**
- Capacity expanded but demand grew faster
- AI chips need more substrate area
- Still a monitored bottleneck

## Ajinomoto Fine-Techno

**Semiconductor materials division:**
- ABF (build-up film)
- Low-k dielectrics
- Encapsulation materials
- ~5% of Ajinomoto revenue but strategic

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Monopoly in critical material
- AI chip demand = ABF demand
- Pricing power
- Food business = stability

**Bear:**
- Small % of overall company
- Food company valuation
- Alternatives being developed
- Capacity expansion dilutes scarcity
