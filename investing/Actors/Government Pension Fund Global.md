# Government Pension Fund Global

The world's largest [[Sovereign Wealth Funds|sovereign wealth fund]] (~$1.7T AUM), managed by [[Norges Bank]] Investment Management (NBIM). Funded by [[Norway]]'s oil and gas revenues. The government caps annual withdrawals at 3% of the fund's value ("fiscal rule"), forcing reliance on non-oil tax revenue including the [[Wealth tax]].
