| **[[Milavous Group]]** | Dubai (DIFC) | Parent trading firm |
| **Milavous Holding Ltd** | — | Shareholder of Milavous Group |
| **Admiral Group** | Dubai | Earlier shipping firm (Persian Gulf, South Asia) |

### Operations

| Method | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Blending** | Mix Iranian/Russian crude with other origins in Fujairah |
| **Rebranding** | Obscure origin so testing can't identify source |
| **Multi-currency** | Yuan transactions beyond US sanctions purview |
| **Dark fleet** | Dozens of tankers, ship-to-ship transfers |

**Key locations:**
- Dubai (headquarters, ICD Brookfield Place 38th floor)
- Fujairah (blending/rebranding)
- Switzerland (office opened 2023)
- Romania (office opened 2023)
- Monaco (associate "Captain D" operates)

## Business model

Iranian and Russian oil → Blended in Fujairah → Sold to China (yuan), India, others

**Why it works:**
- UAE doesn't enforce US sanctions on Iran/Russia
- China doesn't enforce US sanctions
- Yuan transactions outside dollar system
- Blending obscures origin — even buyers testing barrels can't identify source
- Shell companies, ship ownership changes frustrate enforcement

**Clients:** Products have reached Sinopec ([[China]]), Chevron (US), BP (UK) — all claim compliance with sanctions.

## Key relationships

### Ali Shamkhani — father

[[Ali Shamkhani]], former:
- IRGC naval commander
- Defense Minister (2004)
- Secretary, Supreme National Security Council (until 2023)
- Currently: adviser to Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]

Father was US-sanctioned in 2020, complicating son's business. Father denies involvement in son's business; told TV in 2008 he advised son to go private sector rather than government.

### "Captain D" — Alireza Derakhshan

Ship captain operating from Monaco. "Knack for transporting sensitive commodities." Shamkhani calls him "friend" but not partner.

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| US | Not personally sanctioned (Aug 2024) |
| Ships | ~12 vessels sanctioned (Apr 2024) |

**Challenge for US:** Sanctioning network risks oil price spike in election year. Iran gets ~$35B/year from oil exports.
