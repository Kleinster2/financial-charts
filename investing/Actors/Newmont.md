**Transformative deal:**
- Acquired Newcrest Mining ([[Australia]])
- $17B deal
- Added ~2M oz/year production
- Cemented #1 position

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Gold at record highs = record margins
- Largest, most liquid gold miner
- Operating leverage to gold price
- Diversified asset base
- Dividend growth potential

**Bear:**
- Already doubled — priced in?
- Cost inflation risk
- M&A discipline (cycle risk)
- Geopolitical exposure ([[Africa]], LatAm)
- Gold price reversal risk

---

## Cycle discipline warning

**Martin Pradier (Veritas):**
> "If they give money back to shareholders or they reinvest in growth, we're fine. If they start buying other miners at expensive valuations at top of the cycle, yes, that's a problem."

Previous boom cycles marred by bad acquisitions.
