**Advantest** — #1 semiconductor test equipment maker. Tests every chip before shipping. AI complexity = more testing.

---

## Why Advantest matters

Every chip must be tested. Advantest dominates:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 6857.T (Tokyo), ATEYY (ADR) |
| Market cap | ~¥4T (~$26B) |
| Test equipment share | ~50%+ |
| Revenue | ~¥600B |
| Founded | 1954 |

## Business segments

| Segment | % Revenue | Products |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Semiconductor Test** | ~85% | ATE (automatic test equipment) |
| Mechatronics | ~10% | Test handlers, probers |
| Services | ~5% | Maintenance, support |

## Test equipment market

| Company | Share | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Advantest** | ~50% | Memory, SoC, HPC |
| Teradyne | ~35% | SoC, mobile |
| [[Cohu]] | ~10% | Handlers, automotive |
| Others | ~5% | — |

## AI chip testing

**Why AI chips need more testing:**
- Larger dies = more defect probability
- Advanced packaging (HBM, CoWoS) = interface testing
- Higher performance = tighter specs
- Higher ASPs justify more test time

**AI revenue exposure growing rapidly.**

---

## HBM testing opportunity

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| HBM stacking | Test each die + stack |
| Thermal testing | High-temp operation |
| Interface testing | TSV connections |
| Known good die | Must test before stack |

HBM = testing intensity 5-10x vs standard DRAM.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Monopoly position in test
- AI complexity = test intensity
- HBM tailwind massive
- Recurring services revenue
- Every fab needs testers

**Bear:**
- Cyclical with chip cycle
- Concentrated customers
- Teradyne competition
- Yen exposure
