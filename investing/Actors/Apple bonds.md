## Debt trajectory

| Year | Key event | Approx. total outstanding |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 2013 | Inaugural $17B (buybacks while cash overseas) | ~$17B |
| 2014-2015 | EUR, CHF, GBP, AUD debuts | ~$55B |
| 2016-2017 | Continued issuance, green bonds | ~$100B |
| 2017 | [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] — $38B repatriation tax charge | $100B+ |
| 2018-2019 | Post-reform, continued issuing (rates low) | ~$108B |
| 2020-2021 | Pandemic-era low rates, massive issuance | **~$118B (peak)** |
| 2022-2023 | Rates rise, issuance slows | ~$110B |
| 2024 | No issuance | ~$97B |
| 2025 | $4.5B issued, net deleveraging continues | **$91.3B** |

Apple is deliberately deleveraging — letting bonds mature without full replacement. FY2025 buybacks ($89.3B) funded from operating cash flow, not new debt.

## Why Apple borrows

Apple began borrowing in 2013 not out of necessity but tax efficiency. With $145B in cash (71% overseas), issuing bonds at 1-4% was cheaper than paying 35% repatriation tax. After the 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] (one-time 15.5% tax), Apple continued issuing because:

1. After-tax cost of debt was below return on equity
2. Buybacks funded by cheap debt were accretive
3. Interest expense was tax-deductible
4. No revolving credit facility needed — cash position covers everything

Apple also issued $4.7B in [[Green bonds]] across three series (2016, 2017, 2019) for renewable energy and environmental projects.
