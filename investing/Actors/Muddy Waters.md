## Why Muddy Waters matters

**Pioneer of activist short-selling.** Carson Block created the modern playbook for research-driven short campaigns. Take a short position, publish detailed fraud allegations, profit from the collapse. Nate Anderson of [[Hindenburg Research]] credits Block with blazing the trail.

**Sino-Forest (2011)** — The breakthrough. Alleged the Canadian-listed Chinese forestry company was a "multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme." Stock fell 82%. [[Paulson & Co]] sold its entire stake at a $720M loss. Company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012. Established Muddy Waters' credibility.

**Claritev (2020)** — Published "MultiPlan: Private Equity Necrophilia Meets The Great 2020 Money Grab" on November 11, 2020 — exactly one month after [[Claritev]]'s SPAC merger closed. Alleged [[UnitedHealth]] was building a competitor and revenue would collapse. Stock dropped 20% immediately. Predictions proved largely accurate.

## Methodology

1. **Deep research** — Forensic accounting, channel checks, on-the-ground investigation
2. **Take position** — Short the stock before publishing
3. **Publish report** — Detailed, provocative, often with memorable titles
4. **Defend publicly** — Media appearances, response to company rebuttals

The timing of reports is strategic — Claritev report came exactly as the SPAC prospectus went effective.
