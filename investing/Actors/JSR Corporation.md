**JSR Corporation** — World's largest photoresist maker (~27% market share). Taken private by [[Japan Investment Corporation]] for ¥909B ($6.4B) in 2024 to protect strategic supply chain.

## Why JSR matters

Photoresists are the light-sensitive chemicals that transfer circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. JSR dominates:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global photoresist share | ~27% (#1) |
| EUV photoresist share | ~30% (with TOK, Shin-Etsu = 90%) |
| Acquisition price | ¥909B ($6.4B) |
| Delisted | June 25, 2024 (TSE) |
| Acquirer | Japan Investment Corporation (JIC) |

---

## Strategic importance

Japan controls ~90% of advanced EUV photoresists through three companies:
- **JSR** (~27-30%)
- [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] (~25%)
- [[Shin-Etsu]] (~15-20%)

This is a critical chokepoint — no EUV photoresist, no leading-edge chips. The JIC privatization was explicitly about protecting this position.

---

## Why JIC took JSR private

**Official rationale:**
- Enable long-term R&D investment without quarterly pressure
- Strategic importance to semiconductor supply chain
- Counter foreign acquisition interest

**The real story:**
- EUV photoresist is a Japan monopoly worth protecting
- Public markets undervalued strategic assets
- Government wanted control over critical material supply

**CEO Eric Johnson:** Operating as private entity allows "greater flexibility in implementing structural reforms."

## Product segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **EUV photoresists** | 3nm and below, highest growth |
| **ArF immersion** | 7nm-5nm, bread and butter |
| **KrF** | Mature nodes |
| **Life sciences** | May be divested post-privatization |

---

## Post-privatization strategy

**Focus areas:**
- EUV photoresists for 3nm+ nodes
- Global production expansion
- Next-gen metal-oxide resists

**Acquisitions:**
- Yamanaka Hutech (Aug 2024) — strengthens advanced materials position

**Life sciences portfolio:** Under review, carve-out possible. JIC wants pure-play semiconductor focus.

## Customers

- [[TSMC]] — largest customer, all leading nodes
- [[Samsung]] — foundry and memory
- [[Intel]] — ramping EUV usage
- Every leading-edge fab in the world

## Competitive dynamics

| Company | Share | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **JSR** | ~27% | #1, now private |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | #2, public |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Also does wafers |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | Diversified |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | Growing |
| [[DuPont]] / [[Qnity]] | ~7% | US player |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | European player |

## Investment implications

**Can't invest directly** — JSR is private.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] (4186.T) — public competitor, benefits from EUV growth
- [[Shin-Etsu]] (4063.T) — wafers + photoresists
- [[Sumitomo Chemical]] (4005.T) — expanding photoresist business

**Thesis:** EUV photoresist demand grows with every leading-edge node. Japan's monopoly position is defensible.

---

## Key risks

- **Technology risk:** Metal-oxide resists could disrupt current formulations
- **China localization:** Chinese firms attempting domestic photoresist development
- **Concentration risk:** Single-source dependency creates supply chain vulnerability
