**Cerebras** — Wafer-scale AI chips. Entire wafer = one chip. Training + inference. **Last independent SRAM player** after NVIDIA-Groq deal.

---

## Why Cerebras matters

**Post-NVIDIA-Groq positioning** (per Gavin Baker):

> "Cerebras is now in a very interesting and highly strategic position as the last independent SRAM player that was ahead of Groq on all public benchmarks."

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | **~$22B** (Jan 2026 talks) |
| Previous valuation | $8.1B (Sep 2025) |
| Total raised | $2B+ |
| Founded | 2016 |
| Approach | Wafer-scale integration |
| Strategic position | Last independent SRAM player |

---

## Wafer-scale engine (WSE)

**One wafer = one chip:**

| Spec | WSE-3 |
|------|-------|
| Transistors | 4 trillion |
| Cores | 900,000 |
| Size | 46,225 mm² |
| vs GPU | 56x larger than H100 |

Biggest chip ever made.

---

## Why wafer-scale?

**Eliminates interconnect bottleneck:**
- No chip-to-chip communication
- Massive on-chip memory bandwidth
- Designed for large AI models
- Single chip = simpler programming

---

## CS-3 system

**Complete AI system:**
- WSE-3 chip
- 44GB on-chip SRAM
- 125 petaflops FP16
- Inference + training

---

## Business model

**Systems + cloud:**
- Sell complete systems ($2-[[3M]]+)
- Cerebras Cloud inference
- Condor Galaxy supercomputer (with [[G42]])
- Enterprise + sovereign AI

---

## Customers

| Customer | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| [[G42]] (UAE) | Condor Galaxy cluster |
| GSK | Drug discovery |
| [[AstraZeneca]] | Pharma AI |
| National labs | Research |

## January 2026 developments

### $1B raise at $22B valuation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Round size | ~$1B (in talks) |
| Pre-money valuation | **$22B** |
| Previous (Sep 2025) | $8.1B |
| Increase | **2.7x in 4 months** |
| IPO target | Q2 2026 |

**Significance:** Among largest private AI hardware raises ever. Validates "last independent SRAM player" thesis.

### OpenAI $10B+ compute deal (Jan 14, 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deal value | **$10B+** |
| Compute | 750 MW |
| Duration | 2026-2028 (multi-year) |
| Customer | [[OpenAI]] |

**Game-changer:** OpenAI diversifying beyond NVIDIA. Cerebras now has two mega-customers (OpenAI + [[G42]]).

**Why OpenAI chose Cerebras:**
- Inference cost advantage (SRAM)
- Reduce NVIDIA dependency
- Capacity availability
- [[Sam Altman]] was early Cerebras investor
- 15x faster responses than GPU-based systems

---

## IPO filing

**Filed September 2024:**
- First major AI chip IPO attempt
- Revealed $136M revenue (2023)
- Heavy losses
- [[G42]] concentration risk flagged
- **IPO now targeting Q2 2026**

## Post-NVIDIA-Groq landscape

After NVIDIA licensed [[Groq]]'s architecture (Dec 2025):

| Player | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[Groq]] | NVIDIA partner, continues cloud |
| [[SambaNova]] | Acquired by [[Intel]] |
| Cerebras | **Last independent SRAM player** |

**Why Cerebras wasn't acquired:**

| Factor | Groq | Cerebras |
|--------|------|----------|
| Integration | Many-chip rack, fits NVLink | WSE = independent rack |
| Architecture | Easier to integrate | Harder to merge |
| Benchmarks | Strong | Ahead of Groq (public) |

Cerebras's wafer-scale approach makes integration harder — but may preserve independence.

---

## Strategic options

1. **Stay independent** — IPO, compete with Rubin SRAM
2. **Hyperscaler acquisition** — [[Google]], [[Amazon]], [[Microsoft]]
3. **NVIDIA deal** — Similar to Groq (licensing)
4. **Sovereign AI focus** — [[G42]] relationship, geopolitics

**The bull case**: Being last independent SRAM player = strategic scarcity value.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- **Last independent SRAM player** — strategic scarcity
- Ahead of Groq on public benchmarks
- Differentiated architecture (wafer-scale)
- Large model specialist
- IPO = liquidity event
- Potential acquisition target

**Bear:**
- NVIDIA Rubin SRAM competes directly
- Customer concentration ([[G42]])
- High system costs
- Integration difficulty limits partnerships
- Unproven at scale
