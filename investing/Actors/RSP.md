## Why It Matters

RSP vs [[SPY]] spread is the purest measure of market breadth. When SPY outperforms RSP, mega-caps are carrying the index. When RSP leads, the average stock is doing well.

## Characteristics

- **More mid-cap exposure** — equal weighting gives smaller S&P 500 names more influence
- **Sector differences** — less tech, more industrials/financials/materials vs cap-weighted
- **Higher turnover** — quarterly rebalancing creates more trading

## Use Case

Breadth indicator. The SPY-RSP spread in the [[Dashboard]] shows whether the market rally is broad-based or concentrated.
