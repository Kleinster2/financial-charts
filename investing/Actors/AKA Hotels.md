- Direct sales over OTAs lower distribution costs
- Acquisition at discount to replacement cost in prime urban locations
- Flexible exit options for investors — properties can convert between hotel and residential use
- Access AKA membership club adds recurring revenue and loyalty

Sister brand AVE targets the multifamily apartment segment with shorter flexible leases, earning the 2025 Kingsley Excellence Award for resident satisfaction.

## Competitive positioning

| Brand | Segment | Typical stay | Key difference |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| AKA | Luxury extended stay | 1 week – months | Residential suites, direct sales model |

| [[Hilton]] (Home2 Suites) | Mid-scale extended stay | Nights – weeks | Mass market |
| Sonder | Tech-enabled aparthotels | Nights – months | Asset-light, app-driven |
| [[LuxUrban Hotels]] | Lease-arbitrage hotels | Nights | Master-lease model, different price tier |

AKA occupies a niche between luxury hotels and high-end furnished apartments, with few direct competitors at the same price point for month-plus stays.
