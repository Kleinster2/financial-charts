## Brookfield acquisition

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Announced | 2023 |
| Closed | April 30, 2024 |
| Price | $56.50/share ($4.3B total) |
| Premium | 35% to pre-leak close |
| Structure | Cash + stock |
| Brookfield prior stake | 20% (from 2020 strategic partnership) |

**Pre-acquisition relationship (2020):**
- Brookfield invested via strategic partnership
- Reinsurance of $5B existing liabilities
- Up to $5B incremental new sales (IncomeShield fixed indexed annuities)
- Proved the model before full acquisition

---

## Business model

**Fixed indexed annuities (FIA) specialist:**
- Policyholder receives principal protection + returns linked to equity index performance
- AEL earns spread between investment returns and crediting rates
- Long-duration liabilities = permanent capital for Brookfield's private credit/infrastructure deployment

**Distribution strength:**
- 40,000+ independent agents/advisors
- Deep IMO (Independent Marketing Organization) relationships
- Retail-focused — complements Brookfield's institutional capabilities

---

## Post-acquisition strategy

Brookfield Reinsurance (soon **Brookfield Wealth Solutions**) plans:
- Maintain Des Moines HQ, grow Iowa workforce
- Deploy AEL float into Brookfield's proprietary investment strategies (infrastructure, real estate, private credit)
- Scale fixed annuity origination leveraging Brookfield's global asset base
- Integrate with Brookfield's existing reinsurance operations (Bermuda affiliate)

---

## Competitive positioning

AEL fills the same role for [[Brookfield]] that [[Athene]] fills for [[Apollo]] and [[Global Atlantic]] fills for [[KKR]] — the insurance manufacturing platform that generates permanent capital.

Key differentiator: FIA specialist (vs. Athene's broader fixed annuity focus), strong independent agent distribution.
