## 2020 bidding war

| Bidder | Initial offer | Final |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| [[StoneCo]] | R$6.04B | **R$6.7B (winner)** |
| [[TOTVS]] | R$6.1B (hostile) | Lost |

### The controversy

- StoneCo's deal included **R$605M termination fee** — TOTVS called it "excessive" and "violation of Brazilian corporate law"
- Linx founders allegedly got better terms than minority shareholders
- TOTVS made hostile counter-offer but StoneCo prevailed

**StoneCo's thesis:** Combine payments (StoneCo) + retail software (Linx) = integrated commerce platform for Brazilian SMBs.

## StoneCo's Linx disaster

| Metric | Acquisition (2020) | Sale (2025) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Price | R$6.7B (~$1.2B) | R$3.05B (~$540M) | **-54%** |
| Strategic fit | "Payments + software" | Divesting non-core | Failed |

### What went wrong

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Integration difficulties** | Software and payments cultures clashed |
| **Distraction** | Management bandwidth diverted from core payments |
| **Overpaid** | Bidding war pushed price to 20x+ revenue |
| **Macro headwinds** | Brazil rates spiked, tech multiples compressed |

StoneCo retained R$3.8B in tax goodwill from the acquisition — will amortize over 8 years.

## Sale to TOTVS (Jul 2025)

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Buyer | [[TOTVS]] |
| Price | R$3.05B (~$540M) |
| Closed | July 22, 2025 |
| Assets | Education, retail, gas stations, automotive, drugstores, healthcare, home centers, food verticals |

**Irony:** TOTVS lost the 2020 bidding war but acquired Linx 5 years later at half the price.

---

## Investment relevance

**Why Linx matters:**

1. **M&A cautionary tale** — Bidding wars destroy value; StoneCo lost 54% in 5 years.

2. **Vertical integration failure** — "Payments + software" thesis didn't work.

3. **Brazil retail tech** — Now part of TOTVS, Brazil's largest business software company.

4. **Patience rewarded** — TOTVS waited out StoneCo's failure, bought at half price.
