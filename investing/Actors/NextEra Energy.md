**NextEra Energy** — Largest US utility by market cap. Largest renewable energy producer globally.

---

## Why NextEra matters

NextEra is the dominant US utility and renewable energy leader:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~$150B+ (largest US utility) |
| Renewables capacity | Largest globally |
| Utility | Florida Power & Light (FPL) |
| Growth arm | NextEra Energy Resources |

---

## Two businesses

### Florida Power & Light (FPL)
- Regulated utility
- ~12M customers
- Florida = growth market
- Rate base expansion
- Some data center demand

### NextEra Energy Resources
- Unregulated renewable developer
- Wind, solar, storage
- Sells power via PPAs
- Growth engine
- Data center PPAs growing

---

## Data center exposure

**Renewable PPAs for hyperscalers:**
- Hyperscalers want clean energy (ESG)
- NextEra sells long-term renewable PPAs
- Wind/solar farms dedicated to DCs
- Growing revenue stream

**Less direct than Dominion:**
- Not primary utility for DC Alley
- But sells renewable PPAs nationally
- Indirect AI exposure

---

## Renewable scale

| Source | Capacity |
|--------|----------|
| Wind | Largest US |
| Solar | Major |
| Storage | Growing |
| Nuclear | FPL has nuclear plants |

**Scale advantage:**
- Lowest cost developer
- Best sites locked up
- Procurement leverage
- Operating expertise

---

## Florida data centers

- Florida not major DC market (vs Virginia)
- But growing with migration trends
- FPL serves some DC demand
- Less AI-specific exposure

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Largest, lowest-cost renewable developer
- Regulated utility = stability
- Hyperscaler PPA demand
- Clean energy secular trend
- Premium valuation justified

**Bear:**
- Less direct DC exposure than Dominion/Vistra
- Florida not DC hub
- Interest rate sensitivity
- Premium valuation = limited upside
- Renewable competition increasing
