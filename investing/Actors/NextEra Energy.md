## What makes NextEra, NextEra

**Scale + BYOG = unique competitive moat.** NextEra is both the largest US utility (Florida Power & Light, ~12M customers) and the largest US renewable developer (NextEra Energy Resources). This dual structure means it can offer hyperscalers something nobody else can at scale: build dedicated power generation next to your data center, sell it to you via long-term PPA, and handle everything.

**The BYOG model:** CEO John Ketchum (Dec 2025 Investor Day) declared the US has entered a "golden age of power demand." NextEra's pitch: rather than waiting years for grid connections, let us build generation co-located with your data center. Analysts ([[UBS]], [[Morgan Stanley]]) see this as a competitive advantage few can replicate at scale.

## Two businesses

### Florida Power & Light (FPL)
- Regulated utility, ~12M customers
- Florida = high growth market (population inflows)
- Rate base expansion
- Nuclear fleet provides baseload
- Some data center demand (growing)

### NextEra Energy Resources
- Unregulated renewable developer
- Wind, solar, storage — largest US portfolio
- Sells power via long-term PPAs
- Growth engine for hyperscaler demand
- Data center BYOG model

## Revenue and growth

| Year | Revenue |
|------|---------|
| 2023 | $28.1B |
| 2024 | $24.8B |
| TTM (Jan 2026) | $26.3B |

EPS trajectory:

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Largest, lowest-cost renewable developer globally
- BYOG model = unique competitive advantage
- 15 GW DC power hub pipeline
- Google, Meta, ExxonMobil partnerships locked in
- Regulated utility = earnings stability
- 8%+ EPS growth through 2035
- Dividend Aristocrat (30+ years of increases)

**Bear:**
- Premium valuation (~22x 2025 EPS)
- Revenue declined 2023→2024
- Interest rate sensitivity (capital-intensive)
- Nuclear restart risk (Duane Arnold)
- Renewable competition increasing
- FPL less directly exposed to AI than Virginia utilities
