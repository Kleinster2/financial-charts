## Investment case

Bull:
- Cyclical recovery in housing — Friedman calls this the worst housing market in ~50 years; any normalization is a tailwind
- International expansion could double the business in 5-7 years; RH England proving the model at $46M demand
- Margin recovery from 11% toward 20%+ as galleries mature and housing recovers; FY2026 guide 14-15%
- PEG ratio 0.88 — market pricing limited growth while management guides 10-13% revenue growth
- No competitor replicates the integrated gallery + hospitality + membership + design services model
- Tariff mitigation via 52% U.S. production and rising

Bear:
- Extreme leverage — $3.9B net debt, negative equity, 1.7x interest coverage, Altman Z in distress zone
- Key-man risk — entire strategy depends on Friedman, no succession plan
- Revenue fell 19% peak-to-trough in one housing downturn; another leg down against this debt load is dangerous
- International galleries are capital-intensive (historic estates, restaurants) with unproven unit economics at scale
- Path from 11% to 20%+ operating margin requires simultaneous revenue growth, gallery maturation, and cost discipline
