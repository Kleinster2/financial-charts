## Trump economic policy analysis (Jan 2026)

**Adam Posen thesis:** Stagflationary effects of Trump policies (tariffs, deportations) are kicking in. Should be undeniable by April 2, 2026 (Liberation Day anniversary).

### Policy uncertainty at record highs

**US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (30-day MA):**

| Period | Level | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 2006-2007 | ~70 | Pre-crisis normal |
| 2008-2009 | ~180 | Financial crisis |
| 2011 | ~170 | Debt ceiling crisis |
| 2016-2019 | ~100-140 | Trump I |
| 2020 | ~140 | COVID |
| **2024-2025** | **~220** | **Trump II (record high)** |

*Source: Baker, Bloom, Davis (NBER), compiled by Bloomberg*

**Key insight:** Current uncertainty exceeds 2008 financial crisis, 2011 debt ceiling, and COVID — highest on record.

### Inflation forecast

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CPI (Nov 2025) | 2.7% |
| **CPI forecast (Q3 2026)** | **4%+ rate** |

### Key mechanism: Decision paralysis

**Why tariff effects delayed:**
- Businesses uncertain: Will tariffs stick? Exemptions? Court rulings?
- Supply chain decisions: Mexico vs China? Reshoring? Wait and see?
- Stockpiling buffer: Companies front-loaded imports, now depleted
- Even Caterpillar, Toyota hesitant on major production reallocation

**Why deportation effects delayed:**
- Trump claims ~1M deported in first year
- Data shows employment in migrant-dependent industries **unchanged**
- Wages in those sectors **not rising** (would signal shortages)
- Undocumented families still deciding: Leave? Stay? Take family?

### Industries at risk

| Industry | Undocumented labor dependence | Current status |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Health/child-care | High | Home health costs +12% annual |
| Agriculture | High | Employment flat |
| Food processing | High | Employment flat |
| Residential construction | High | Employment flat |

**Posen:** When shortages materialize, employers must raise wages → inflation.

### Investment duality

| Sector | Status |
|--------|--------|
| AI-related capex | Driving GDP growth (Q2-Q3 2025) |
| Non-AI private investment | **Near zero growth** |

**Why non-AI investment weak despite:**
- Favorable tax code (One Big Beautiful Bill)
- Low real interest rates
- Solid corporate balance sheets
- Available private credit
- Falling energy prices
- Deregulation

**Answer:** Policy-induced uncertainty. Rule of law concerns, corruption fears, data reliability questions, central bank independence doubts.

### Brexit parallel

**UK post-2016 referendum:**
- Private investment flatlined for years
- Uncertainty → delayed/cancelled capex
- "Irreversibility" of capital expenditures makes firms cautious

**Posen:** US under Trump potentially facing similar situation.

### 2026 outlook

**AI boom + looser fiscal policy + tariff/deportation effects = compounding inflationary pressures**

Labor and imported input shortages will become more widespread.
