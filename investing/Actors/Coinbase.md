Coinbase — Largest US crypto exchange and first crypto company in the S&P 500 (May 2025). Infrastructure layer for tokenization. Now a global derivatives leader after Deribit acquisition.

Largest US crypto exchange with ~$35B market cap, $7.2B FY2025 revenue (+9% YoY), and S&P 500 inclusion (May 2025). Subscription revenue ($2.8B, +23% YoY) now 41% of net revenue, providing counter-cyclical stability against trading volume swings. IPO'd via direct listing at $381 (Apr 2021), crashed to ~$35 in the 2022 bear market, peaked ~$440 in late 2025, then fell to ~$141 on Q4 crypto downturn. Q4 2025 net loss of $667M was driven by $718M unrealized crypto investment losses — operating income was $274M. The bull case: crypto infrastructure monopoly in the US, tokenization platform, Deribit acquisition for global derivatives. The bear case: revenue still heavily correlated to crypto cycles, regulatory overhang, and transaction fee compression as competition intensifies.

## Price history

![[coinbase-price.png]]
*IPO at $381 (Apr 2021) during crypto euphoria. Crashed to ~$35 in 2022 bear market. Recovered with 2024 crypto rally and S&P 500 inclusion. Peaked ~$440 in late 2025, now ~$141 — down ~55% from highs as Q4 crypto downturn and earnings miss accelerated the selloff.*

## Fundamentals

![[coinbase-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue highly correlated with crypto market cycles. 2024 was a breakout year ($6.6B revenue), but 2025 showed deceleration: $7.2B (+9% YoY). Q4 2025 net loss of $667M was driven by $718M in unrealized crypto investment losses, not operations — operating income was $274M. Subscription revenue ($2.8B, +23% YoY) now 41% of net revenue, providing counter-cyclical stability.*

## Why Coinbase matters

Coinbase is crypto's on-ramp and infrastructure provider:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Exchange | Buy/sell crypto (retail + institutional) |
| Custody | Store crypto for institutions |
| Staking | Earn yield on proof-of-stake coins |
| Base | Layer 2 blockchain for apps |
| USDC | Co-creator with Circle |

---

## Tokenization relevance

Infrastructure for tokenized assets:
- Custody solutions for token issuers
- Trading infrastructure
- Regulatory expertise
- Base blockchain for token settlement

If tokenization scales, Coinbase benefits as infrastructure.

See [[Tokenized private shares]] for context.

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Consumer]] | Retail trading, wallet |
| Institutional | Prime brokerage, custody |
| Subscription/services | Staking, USDC interest |
| Base | Layer 2 blockchain revenue |

---

## Revenue model

| Source | FY 2025 | % of net revenue |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Transaction revenue | $4.1B | 59% |
| Subscription/services | $2.8B | 41% |

Sub & services now 41% of net revenue (up from ~35% in FY 2024), 5.5x the 2021 cycle peak. 12 products generating $100M+ annualized revenue. Shift toward recurring revenue continues.

---

## Regulatory position

The most compliant US crypto company:
- Registered with SEC (public company)
- State money transmitter licenses
- Custody licenses
- Working with regulators

SEC lawsuit dismissed (Feb 2025): The SEC dropped its 2023 enforcement action alleging Coinbase operated an unregistered securities exchange. Dismissal was "with prejudice" — cannot be refiled. Part of broader SEC pivot under Chair [[Paul Atkins]], who formed a Crypto Task Force to develop regulatory framework. SEC's 2026 priorities removed all crypto references.

Remaining legal matters: Coinbase continues pursuing its petition to force the SEC to establish formal crypto rules and seeking internal documents about the agency's regulatory deliberations.

## USDC stablecoin

Co-created with [[Circle]]:
- Dollar-backed stablecoin
- ~$30B+ market cap
- Used for trading, payments, DeFi
- Coinbase earns revenue share on USDC reserves — **$364M in Q4 2025** alone (stablecoin revenue line)
- [[GENIUS Act]] (Jul 2025) legitimized USDC as part of US payment system

**Meta/Stripe catalyst (Feb 2026):** [[Meta]] is testing stablecoin payments across its apps (3.5B DAUs) for H2 2026, with [[Stripe]]/Bridge as infrastructure partner. If USDC is the primary stablecoin routed through Bridge, Coinbase's revenue share scales directly with circulation growth. See [[Circle]] and [[Stripe]] for details.

---

## Base blockchain

Layer 2 on Ethereum:
- Lower fees, faster transactions
- Growing developer ecosystem
- On-chain apps and tokens
- Potential tokenization infrastructure

---

## Deribit acquisition

Largest crypto M&A deal ($2.9B, Aug 2025):

Coinbase acquired [[Deribit]], the world's leading crypto options exchange, for $2.9B in cash and stock.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deal size | $2.9B (cash + stock) |
| Announced | May 8, 2025 |
| Closed | Aug 14, 2025 |
| Open interest | ~$60B |
| 2024 volume | $1T+ |

Strategic rationale: Full-spectrum trading (spot, futures, perpetuals, options) on one platform. Institutional-grade derivatives. Global expansion outside US regulatory constraints.

Deribit generated $30M+ in July 2025 transaction revenue alone. Founders John and Marius Jansen exited post-acquisition.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Crypto infrastructure leader
- S&P 500 constituent (passive flows)
- SEC lawsuit resolved
- Derivatives expansion via Deribit
- Subscription revenue growing (41% of net rev)
- USDC revenue share scales with [[Meta]]/[[Stripe]] stablecoin adoption
- Base blockchain growth
- Tokenization tailwind

Bear:
- Crypto volatility affects revenue
- Competition (Binance, Kraken)
- Fee compression
- Stock down ~55% from late-2025 highs (~$141 in Feb 2026)
- Derivatives integration risk

| FY 2025 revenue | $7.2B (+9% YoY) |
| FY 2024 revenue | $6.6B (+111% YoY) |
| Q4 2025 revenue | $1.78B (-22% YoY) |
| Q4 2025 net loss | -$667M (GAAP) |
| Q4 2025 operating income | $274M |
| Cash & equivalents | $11.3B |
| Verified users | 110M+ |
| Assets on platform | $300B+ |

### Q4 2025 (reported Feb 12, 2026)

Missed on both top and bottom line. Crypto winter reasserted — transaction volumes fell sharply.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | YoY |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.78B | $2.27B | -22% |
| Transaction revenue | $983M | — | -6% QoQ |
| Subscription & services | $727M | — | -3% QoQ |
| Net income (loss) | -$667M | $1.3B | — |
| EPS | $0.66 | $3.39 | Miss vs $1.05 est |
| Operating expenses | $1.5B | — | +9% QoQ |

Full-year 2025: $7.2B revenue (+9% YoY). Subscription & services revenue $2.8B (+23% YoY), 5.5x higher than prior cycle peak (2021). All-time high trading volume (+156% YoY) and market share (+103% YoY).

Q4 drag from [[Deribit]] and Echo acquisition costs, plus higher USDC rewards. $1.7B in share repurchases fully offset 2025 SBC dilution. Also buying [[Bitcoin]] on balance sheet.

Balance sheet: $11B+ cash and equivalents. Strong position despite Q4 loss.

Stock reaction: -8%. [[Monness Crespi]] downgraded to Sell with $120 PT. Stock near 52-week low ($139).

CEO [[Brian Armstrong]]: "The Everything Exchange is working... We're in pole position to capitalize on whatever 2026 has in store."

## Early investors

Coinbase raised from top VCs including [[Andreessen Horowitz]], [[Union Square Ventures]], and [[Ribbit Capital]].

Epstein connection: Jeffrey Epstein invested $3M in the 2014 Series C via a USVI LLC (IGO Company), introduced by [[Brock Pierce]]. Stake was <1% with no governance role. Epstein sold half for ~$15M in 2018; retained remainder. Disclosed in Feb 2026 DOJ document release. No operational relevance — historical cap table footnote.
