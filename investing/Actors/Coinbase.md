## Why Coinbase matters

Coinbase is crypto's on-ramp and infrastructure provider:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Exchange | Buy/sell crypto (retail + institutional) |
| Custody | Store crypto for institutions |
| Staking | Earn yield on proof-of-stake coins |
| Base | Layer 2 blockchain for apps |
| USDC | Co-creator with Circle |

---

## Tokenization relevance

**Infrastructure for tokenized assets:**
- Custody solutions for token issuers
- Trading infrastructure
- Regulatory expertise
- Base blockchain for token settlement

If tokenization scales, Coinbase benefits as infrastructure.

See [[Tokenized private shares]] for context.

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Consumer]] | Retail trading, wallet |
| Institutional | Prime brokerage, custody |
| Subscription/services | Staking, USDC interest |
| Base | Layer 2 blockchain revenue |

---

## Revenue model

| Source | % of revenue |
|--------|--------------|
| Transaction fees | ~50% |
| Subscription/services | ~40% |
| Other | ~10% |

**Shift:** Moving from volatile trading fees to recurring subscription revenue.

---

## Regulatory position

**The most compliant US crypto company:**
- Registered with SEC (public company)
- State money transmitter licenses
- Custody licenses
- Working with regulators

**SEC lawsuit dismissed (Feb 2025):** The SEC dropped its 2023 enforcement action alleging Coinbase operated an unregistered securities exchange. Dismissal was "with prejudice" — cannot be refiled. Part of broader SEC pivot under Chair [[Paul Atkins]], who formed a Crypto Task Force to develop regulatory framework. SEC's 2026 priorities removed all crypto references.

**Remaining legal matters:** Coinbase continues pursuing its petition to force the SEC to establish formal crypto rules and seeking internal documents about the agency's regulatory deliberations.

## USDC stablecoin

**Co-created with Circle:**
- Dollar-backed stablecoin
- ~$30B+ market cap
- Used for trading, payments, DeFi
- Coinbase earns interest on reserves

---

## Base blockchain

**Layer 2 on Ethereum:**
- Lower fees, faster transactions
- Growing developer ecosystem
- On-chain apps and tokens
- Potential tokenization infrastructure

---

## Deribit acquisition

**Largest crypto M&A deal ($2.9B, Aug 2025):**

Coinbase acquired [[Deribit]], the world's leading crypto options exchange, for $2.9B in cash and stock.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deal size | $2.9B (cash + stock) |
| Announced | May 8, 2025 |
| Closed | Aug 14, 2025 |
| Open interest | ~$60B |
| 2024 volume | $1T+ |

**Strategic rationale:** Full-spectrum trading (spot, futures, perpetuals, options) on one platform. Institutional-grade derivatives. Global expansion outside US regulatory constraints.

Deribit generated $30M+ in July 2025 transaction revenue alone. Founders John and Marius Jansen exited post-acquisition.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Crypto infrastructure leader
- S&P 500 constituent (passive flows)
- SEC lawsuit resolved
- Derivatives expansion via Deribit
- Subscription revenue growing
- Base blockchain growth
- Tokenization tailwind

**Bear:**
- Crypto volatility affects revenue
- Competition (Binance, Kraken)
- Fee compression
- Stock down ~37% YTD (Feb 2026)
- Derivatives integration risk

## Early investors

Coinbase raised from top VCs including [[Andreessen Horowitz]], [[Union Square Ventures]], and [[Ribbit Capital]].

**Epstein connection:** Jeffrey Epstein invested $3M in the 2014 Series C via a USVI LLC (IGO Company), introduced by [[Brock Pierce]]. Stake was <1% with no governance role. Epstein sold half for ~$15M in 2018; retained remainder. Disclosed in Feb 2026 DOJ document release. No operational relevance — historical cap table footnote.
