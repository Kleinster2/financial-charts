## Hard market execution

Travelers exemplifies disciplined P&C underwriting in a hard market:
- 10% renewal premium increases (2023-2024) on commercial lines
- 85% retention rates maintained (clients absorbing price increases)
- Combined ratio improvement: 83.2% (Q4 2025) — highly profitable underwriting
- Float invested conservatively (mostly fixed income)

## Canada divestiture (2025)

Selling personal + majority of commercial Canadian insurance to Definity Financial for $2.4B (expected Q1 2026 close). Retaining Canadian surety business. Signals focus on US commercial lines where competitive advantages are strongest.

## P&C economics

Unlike life/annuity insurers targeted by PE firms, P&C insurers like Travelers face:
- **Catastrophe exposure** — unpredictable hurricane/wildfire/flood losses
- **Short-tail liabilities** — claims resolved in 1-3 years (vs. 20-30 year annuities)
- **Underwriting cycle** — hard/soft market rotation affects pricing power
- **Less PE interest** — PE firms prefer predictable life/annuity liabilities for spread income

This is why Travelers is *not* a PE-insurance convergence target — its liabilities are too short and unpredictable for the permanent capital model.
