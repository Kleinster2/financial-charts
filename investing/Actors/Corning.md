## Why Corning matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | GLW |
| Market cap | ~$95B |
| Revenue | ~$14B |
| Founded | 1851 |
| HQ | Corning, NY |

170+ years of materials science innovation — from Edison's light bulb glass to iPhone screens to AI data center fiber.

![[glw-price-chart.png]]
*+260% since 2020, lagging [[Amphenol|APH]] (+500%) but crushing [[Materials Select Sector SPDR|XLB]] (+85%). Tracked materials sector 2020-23 during display downcycle, then exploded 2024-26 on AI fiber demand.*

## Jan 27, 2026: Meta deal sends stock to record high

**Stock +16.6%** — best day since April 2004, hit all-time high at $114.

### The deal

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Customer | [[Meta]] |
| Value | **Up to $6B** |
| Duration | Through 2030 |
| Products | Fiber-optic cable, connectivity hardware |
| Purpose | US AI data center expansion |
| Manufacturing | Hickory, North Carolina expansion |

CEO Wendell Weeks: hyperscalers are "the company's most critical growth engine."

### Why it matters

- **Validation of fiber supercycle** — AI data centers need massive interconnect bandwidth
- **US manufacturing** — domestic production for hyperscaler buildout
- **Recurring revenue** — multi-year commitment provides visibility
- **Stock up 123% YoY** — market pricing in AI infrastructure tailwind

**Morgan Stanley caution:** Reaction "seemingly overdone" — but Cramer says $200 target.

## Business segments

| Segment | Q3 2025 Rev | Growth | Description |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Optical Communications** | $1.65B | +33% | Fiber, cable, connectivity for data centers/telecom |
| **Display Technologies** | ~$1B | +12% | LCD glass substrates (TV, monitors) |
| **Specialty Materials** | — | +9% | Gorilla Glass, semiconductor materials |
| **Environmental** | — | — | Automotive emissions substrates |
| **Life Sciences** | — | — | Lab equipment, pharmaceutical packaging |

**Optical Communications** is largest and fastest-growing — the AI beneficiary.

## Technology moats

| Innovation | Year | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|
| Low-loss optical fiber | 1970 | Enabled fiber optic telecom |
| Fusion glass process | — | LCD display dominance |
| Gorilla Glass | 2007 | 8B+ devices (Apple, Samsung) |

Core competency: precision glass/ceramics manufacturing at scale.

## AI infrastructure angle

Corning benefits from [[AI Infrastructure]] buildout:

| Driver | Corning product |
|--------|-----------------|
| Data center interconnects | Fiber optic cable |
| High-bandwidth networking | Connectivity hardware |
| Hyperscaler expansion | Multi-year supply deals |

The Meta deal validates thesis that fiber demand scales with AI compute buildout. More data centers = more fiber.

## Financials

![[glw-fundamentals.png]]
*10-year quarterly history. Revenue grew from ~$2.3B to $4.1B with COVID dip (2020) and display downcycle (2023). Net income volatile: 2016 spikes from Samsung JV gain, 2021 Q4 spike, 2023-24 trough, now recovering. Loss quarters excluded from chart (Q1 2016, Q1 2018, Q4 2017, H1 2020, Q2 2021, Q4 2022-23, Q3 2024).*

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | Margin | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2024 | $13.1B | $0.5B | 3.9% | Display downcycle trough |
| 2023 | $12.6B | $0.6B | 4.6% | Display downcycle |
| 2022 | $14.2B | $1.3B | 9.3% | Peak revenues |
| 2021 | $14.1B | $1.9B | 13.5% | Post-COVID recovery |
| 2020 | $11.3B | $0.4B | 3.7% | COVID impact |
| 2019 | $11.5B | $0.9B | 7.5% | Pre-COVID baseline |
| 2018 | $11.3B | $1.0B | 8.6% | |
| 2017 | $10.1B | -$0.6B | — | Tax reform write-offs |
| 2016 | $9.4B | $3.6B | 38.3% | Samsung Display JV gain |
| 2015 | $9.1B | $1.2B | 13.6% | |

*Highly cyclical: 2016 NI inflated by one-time Samsung JV gain; 2017 loss from tax reform; 2020-24 display downcycle compressed margins; optical now driving recovery.*

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Fiber supercycle from AI data centers
- Multi-year hyperscaler contracts (Meta $6B)
- US manufacturing advantage (CHIPS Act adjacent)
- Gorilla Glass in smartphones/AR/VR
- 170 years of materials science IP

**Bear:**
- Display segment cyclical (TV demand)
- Customer concentration (Apple, hyperscalers)
- Stock up 123% YoY — priced for perfection
- Morgan Stanley: Meta reaction "overdone"
