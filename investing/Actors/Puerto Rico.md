## Energy crisis

Puerto Rico's grid is the defining infrastructure challenge. Hurricane Maria (2017) destroyed ~80% of the grid. Privatization followed but has not resolved reliability.

| Component | Operator | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| T&D | [[LUMA Energy]] | 15-year contract, governor wants termination |
| Generation | [[Genera PR]] ([[New Fortress Energy]]) | 10-year contract, capacity shortfall |
| Asset ownership | [[PREPA]] | Bankrupt since 2017, ~$8.5B in debt |

Generation capacity deficit: LUMA projected 90 load-shed events May-Oct 2025 vs 20 in same period 2024. Emergency procurement of 700-850 MW authorized by [[PREB]] in Mar 2025.

Long-term procurement: 2,500-3,000 MW of new baseload capacity being solicited.
