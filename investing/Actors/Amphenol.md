## Why Amphenol matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | APH |
| Market cap | ~$80B |
| Business | Connectors, cables, sensors |
| AI exposure | High-speed data center interconnects |

## AI infrastructure exposure

**Data center products:**

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| High-speed connectors | Server interconnects |
| Fiber optic | Data transmission |
| Power connectors | DC power distribution |
| Cable assemblies | GPU clusters |

Every AI server needs Amphenol connectors.

## Diversification advantage

**Why institutions like APH for AI:**

**Brad Conger (Hirtle Callaghan):**
> "Own the things that don't have the greatest upside exposure to AI, but will participate. They benefit but it's not the only thing they do."

| End market | % revenue |
|------------|-----------|
| IT/Data comm | ~25% |
| Military/[[Aerospace]] | ~20% |
| Industrial | ~20% |
| [[Automotive]] | ~20% |
| Mobile/[[Consumer]] | ~15% |

Not dependent on AI — but participates in upside.

## Competitive position

| Factor | Amphenol |
|--------|----------|
| Scale | \#2 globally in connectors |
| Breadth | 100,000+ products |
| Customers | Every major OEM |
| M&A | Serial acquirer |

Molex (\#1) is private. Amphenol = best public pure-play.

## AI interconnect demand

**Why connectors matter for AI:**
- GPU clusters need high-bandwidth connections
- NVLink requires specialized connectors
- Power delivery = connector intensive
- Liquid cooling = new connector types

More GPUs = more connectors.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI infrastructure tailwind
- Diversified (not AI-dependent)
- Secular connector demand
- Serial acquirer / consolidator
- High margins

**Bear:**
- Already well-known AI play
- Valuation not cheap
- Cyclical end markets (auto, industrial)
- Less upside than pure-plays
