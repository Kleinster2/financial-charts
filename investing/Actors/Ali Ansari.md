## Political connections

### "Insured by Imam Hossein"

Ansari's own phrase for his protection strategy: **give every faction a share so no faction demands investigation.**

| Faction | What they received |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Leader's office** | Mojtaba Khamenei proximity; companies allegedly fronts for his network |
| **IRGC** | Funding (per [[UK]] sanctions); military-economic access |
| **Ahmadinejad network** | 1.2B toman campaign contribution (2009) via Mehrdad Bazrpash |
| **Conservatives** | Islamic Coalition — Ala Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi on Iran Mall board |
| **Religious establishment** | Donated carpets to shrines (Iran/Iraq), built mosques, funded charities |

**The result:** Cross-factional complicity. Every faction had reason to block investigation.

### [[Mojtaba Khamenei]] link

Principal intermediary for [[Mojtaba Khamenei]]'s offshore empire. Western intelligence assessment identifies Ansari as vital to the deals.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| First meeting | Late 1980s, Iran-Iraq War |
| Private meetings | House in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district |
| Business meetings | Ayandeh Bank offices |
| Role | Primary account holder for Mojtaba's network |

**The network:**
- Ansari holds assets that trace back to Mojtaba through shell companies
- Funds originate primarily from Iranian oil sales
- UK property (£100M+), European hotels, UAE villa
- Routing through Swiss, Liechtenstein, UAE banks

**Ansari's denial:** Through lawyer, "strongly denies that he has ever had any financial or personal relationship with Mojtaba Khamenei."

**What this meant domestically:**
- Regulatory scrutiny avoided for years
- Criminal charges didn't stick (2022 embezzlement)
- Bank allowed to operate obvious Ponzi dynamics
- CBI continued lending despite insolvency

### Moris Mashali — co-director

Iranian-born British solicitor. Co-director with Ansari at multiple offshore entities.

| Entity | Shared role |
|--------|-------------|
| Ziba Leisure Ltd | Directors |
| Allsco Gravenbruch (Frankfurt hotel) | Mashali is MD |
| Veritas Reales Investment Ltd | Directors |
| A&A Leisure Ltd | Directors (dissolved 2024) |

Mashali stated connection to Ansari was as "regulated lawyer providing legal advice."

### Ahmadinejad administration

Tat Bank (2009) founded with support from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government.

**Campaign sponsorship:**
- 2009: Leader's office asked Ansari to sponsor Ahmadinejad's re-election campaign
- Amount: 1.2 billion toman
- Delivered via: Mehrdad Bazrpash, Ahmadinejad's campaign chief
- Effect: Banking license viewed as political reward to campaign supporter

Regulators accused Tat founders of failing to provide required capital — allegedly submitted just 1/10 of legal minimum through property collateral rather than cash. The political connection overrode the rules.

### Father's funeral (May 2025)

Ali-Akbar Ansari died May-June 2025. His funeral at Iran Mall revealed the family's protection network:

| Attendee | Position |
|----------|----------|
| **Vahid Haqqanian** | Leader's office representative |
| **Mahmoud Alavi** | Former Intelligence Minister |
| **Seyed Ali Khomeini** | Khomeini family member |
| Multiple MPs | Parliamentary connections |

The funeral photos showed the breadth of Ansari's network — Leader's office, intelligence, revolutionary dynasty, legislature.

**Timing:** Ali-Akbar's death removed a protective figure. The second pillar, Ala Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi (Islamic Coalition, Iran Mall board), also died in 2025. Only after both deaths did the Central Bank dissolve Ayandeh.

### 2022 embezzlement charges

Ansari was criminally charged with embezzlement in 2022. **Escaped prosecution** — connections to top leadership protected him.

### Why Ansari wasn't prosecuted (when others were executed)

| Name | Crime | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Babak Zanjani** | Sanctions evasion, $2.7B fraud | Death sentence |
| **Mah-Afarid Khosravi** | Banking fraud, $2.6B | Executed 2014 |
| **Hossein Hedayati** | Financial crimes | Prosecuted |
| **Mohammadreza Zonouzi** | Banking fraud | Prosecuted |
| **Ali Ansari** | $5B+ self-dealing | **Protected** |

**Why the difference?**
- Zanjani's value was sanctions evasion — useful but expendable once regime could sacrifice him
- Ansari's "virtues" were religious/charitable: shrines, mosques, charities
- Ansari distributed access across all factions; no faction had incentive to investigate
- Cross-factional complicity vs single-patron dependence

## The Ayandeh scheme

### Building the extraction vehicle

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2009 | Founds Tat Bank |
| 2012 | Merges Tat + Salehin + Aatee → Ayandeh Bank |
| 2015 | Ayandeh begins operations |
| 2015-2025 | Extracts $1B+ via self-dealing loans |
| Oct 2025 | Bank collapses |

### Self-dealing structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Legal loan limit | 200 trillion rials ($187M) |
| Actual loans | 10x limit |
| Loans to Ansari-linked entities | 1.3 quadrillion rials ($1.21B) |
| Personal "loan" for Iran Mall | 740 trillion rials ($687M) |
| [[Shell]] companies | ~100 |
| Amount repaid | **$0** |

**90%+ of Ayandeh's funds** allegedly channeled to Ansari's own ventures.

### How it worked

```
Public deposits → Ayandeh (high rates promised)
    → "Loans" to Ansari shell companies
        → Fund Ansari real estate projects
            → Projects don't generate cash
                → Loans never repaid
                    → Bank borrows from CBI
                        → CBI prints money
                            → 7M depositors lose savings
```

## [[UK]] sanctions (October 2025)

Days after Ayandeh's collapse, [[UK]] Foreign Office sanctioned Ansari.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | Late October 2025 |
| Basis | "Facilitating and supporting the hostile activities" of Islamic [[Republic]] and IRGC |
| Designation | "Corrupt Iranian banker and businessman" |
| Specific allegation | Funding IRGC |
| Asset freeze | Yes — [[UK]] assets |
| [[Travel]] ban | Yes ([[UK]]) |

**Note:** [[UK]] sanctions freeze the Bishop's Avenue property. Ansari remains protected domestically in Iran.

## Iran Mall — the monument to extraction

Ansari's flagship project, funded by depositor money.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | West Tehran |
| Type | Mega shopping/leisure complex |
| Funding | $687M "loan" from Ayandeh |
| [[Shell]] companies | ~100 created to channel funds |
| Repaid | $0 |

**The problem:** You can't liquidate a mall to pay depositors. When Ayandeh needed cash, Iran Mall was just concrete.

---

## Aftermath

| Outcome | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Ayandeh | Merged into Bank Melli |
| Depositors | 7 million, $2.34B trapped |
| Ansari | [[UK]]-sanctioned, whereabouts unclear |
| Criminal liability (Iran) | None enforced (protected) |
| Assets | Presumably still controls real estate empire |

---

## Why he matters

Ansari is the template for **regime-connected extraction** in Iran:

1. Get banking license via political connections
2. Offer high rates to attract deposits
3. Lend deposits to yourself via shells
4. Build illiquid assets (real estate)
5. Never repay
6. When bank fails, CBI prints money / state bank absorbs
7. Depositors wiped out via inflation
8. You keep the assets

**He's not an aberration — he's the system working as designed.**
