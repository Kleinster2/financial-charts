## Political connections

### "Insured by Imam Hossein"

Ansari's own phrase for his protection strategy: **give every faction a share so no faction demands investigation.**

| Faction | What they received |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Leader's office** | Mojtaba Khamenei proximity; companies allegedly fronts for his network |
| **IRGC** | Funding (per UK sanctions); military-economic access |
| **Ahmadinejad network** | 1.2B toman campaign contribution (2009) via Mehrdad Bazrpash |
| **Conservatives** | Islamic Coalition — Ala Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi on Iran Mall board |
| **Religious establishment** | Donated carpets to shrines (Iran/Iraq), built mosques, funded charities |

**The result:** Cross-factional complicity. Every faction had reason to block investigation.

### Mojtaba Khamenei link

Documented proximity to **Mojtaba Khamenei**, son of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

- UK reports: Ansari's companies (including Iran Mall International Development Company) allegedly act as fronts for money laundering tied to Mojtaba's network
- Social media in Iran: Users pointed to Mojtaba connection when Ayandeh collapsed, arguing it shielded Ansari from scrutiny

**What this meant:**
- Regulatory scrutiny avoided for years
- Criminal charges didn't stick
- Bank allowed to operate obvious Ponzi dynamics
- CBI continued lending despite insolvency

### Ahmadinejad administration

Tat Bank (2009) founded with support from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government.

**Campaign sponsorship:**
- 2009: Leader's office asked Ansari to sponsor Ahmadinejad's re-election campaign
- Amount: 1.2 billion toman
- Delivered via: Mehrdad Bazrpash, Ahmadinejad's campaign chief
- Effect: Banking license viewed as political reward to campaign supporter

Regulators accused Tat founders of failing to provide required capital — allegedly submitted just 1/10 of legal minimum through property collateral rather than cash. The political connection overrode the rules.

### Father's funeral (May 2025)

Ali-Akbar Ansari died May-June 2025. His funeral at Iran Mall revealed the family's protection network:

| Attendee | Position |
|----------|----------|
| **Vahid Haqqanian** | Leader's office representative |
| **Mahmoud Alavi** | Former Intelligence Minister |
| **Seyed Ali Khomeini** | Khomeini family member |
| Multiple MPs | Parliamentary connections |

The funeral photos showed the breadth of Ansari's network — Leader's office, intelligence, revolutionary dynasty, legislature.

**Timing:** Ali-Akbar's death removed a protective figure. The second pillar, Ala Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi (Islamic Coalition, Iran Mall board), also died in 2025. Only after both deaths did the Central Bank dissolve Ayandeh.

### 2022 embezzlement charges

Ansari was criminally charged with embezzlement in 2022. **Escaped prosecution** — connections to top leadership protected him.

### Why Ansari wasn't prosecuted (when others were executed)

| Name | Crime | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Babak Zanjani** | Sanctions evasion, $2.7B fraud | Death sentence |
| **Mah-Afarid Khosravi** | Banking fraud, $2.6B | Executed 2014 |
| **Hossein Hedayati** | Financial crimes | Prosecuted |
| **Mohammadreza Zonouzi** | Banking fraud | Prosecuted |
| **Ali Ansari** | $5B+ self-dealing | **Protected** |

**Why the difference?**
- Zanjani's value was sanctions evasion — useful but expendable once regime could sacrifice him
- Ansari's "virtues" were religious/charitable: shrines, mosques, charities
- Ansari distributed access across all factions; no faction had incentive to investigate
- Cross-factional complicity vs single-patron dependence

## The Ayandeh scheme

### Building the extraction vehicle

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2009 | Founds Tat Bank |
| 2012 | Merges Tat + Salehin + Aatee → Ayandeh Bank |
| 2015 | Ayandeh begins operations |
| 2015-2025 | Extracts $1B+ via self-dealing loans |
| Oct 2025 | Bank collapses |

### Self-dealing structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Legal loan limit | 200 trillion rials ($187M) |
| Actual loans | 10x limit |
| Loans to Ansari-linked entities | 1.3 quadrillion rials ($1.21B) |
| Personal "loan" for Iran Mall | 740 trillion rials ($687M) |
| Shell companies | ~100 |
| Amount repaid | **$0** |

**90%+ of Ayandeh's funds** allegedly channeled to Ansari's own ventures.

### How it worked

```
Public deposits → Ayandeh (high rates promised)
    → "Loans" to Ansari shell companies
        → Fund Ansari real estate projects
            → Projects don't generate cash
                → Loans never repaid
                    → Bank borrows from CBI
                        → CBI prints money
                            → 7M depositors lose savings
```

## International assets

### UK property

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Property | Mansion on Bishop's Avenue ("Billionaire's Row"), North London |
| Value | £33.7 million |
| Holding vehicle | Birch Ventures Limited (Isle of Man company) |
| Service address | Dubai |
| Features | 8 bedrooms, 3 reception rooms, indoor pool, cinema, games rooms, library |
| Total UK real estate | £73 million+ |

### Other passports

| Citizenship | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| **Iran** | Primary |
| **Cyprus** | Reported |
| **St. Kitts & Nevis** | Reported (CBI passport program) |

The multiple passports enabled international asset placement while maintaining Iranian base.

## UK sanctions (October 2025)

Days after Ayandeh's collapse, UK Foreign Office sanctioned Ansari.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | Late October 2025 |
| Basis | "Facilitating and supporting the hostile activities" of Islamic Republic and IRGC |
| Designation | "Corrupt Iranian banker and businessman" |
| Specific allegation | Funding IRGC |
| Asset freeze | Yes — UK assets |
| Travel ban | Yes (UK) |

**Note:** UK sanctions freeze the Bishop's Avenue property. Ansari remains protected domestically in Iran.

## Iran Mall — the monument to extraction

Ansari's flagship project, funded by depositor money.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | West Tehran |
| Type | Mega shopping/leisure complex |
| Funding | $687M "loan" from Ayandeh |
| Shell companies | ~100 created to channel funds |
| Repaid | $0 |

**The problem:** You can't liquidate a mall to pay depositors. When Ayandeh needed cash, Iran Mall was just concrete.

---

## Aftermath

| Outcome | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Ayandeh | Merged into Bank Melli |
| Depositors | 7 million, $2.34B trapped |
| Ansari | UK-sanctioned, whereabouts unclear |
| Criminal liability (Iran) | None enforced (protected) |
| Assets | Presumably still controls real estate empire |

## Why he matters

Ansari is the template for **regime-connected extraction** in Iran:

1. Get banking license via political connections
2. Offer high rates to attract deposits
3. Lend deposits to yourself via shells
4. Build illiquid assets (real estate)
5. Never repay
6. When bank fails, CBI prints money / state bank absorbs
7. Depositors wiped out via inflation
8. You keep the assets

**He's not an aberration — he's the system working as designed.**
