## Why PREPA matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Type | Government-owned corporation |
| Status | Title III bankruptcy (since July 2017) |
| Legacy debt | ~$8.5B in bond claims |
| Customers served | ~1.5M |
| Generation capacity | ~3,600 MW (operated by [[Genera PR]]) |

PREPA still owns the grid assets but no longer operates them. It is the last major [[Puerto Rico]] entity still in bankruptcy under [[PROMESA]].

## Debt restructuring

### 5th Amended Plan of Adjustment (March 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original debt | ~$8.5B |
| Proposed recovery | ~$2.6B (cash or bonds) — ~80% haircut |
| Legacy Charge | Eliminated in 5th amendment |
| Creditor support | ~44% of debt holders signed RSAs |

Supporting creditors: [[BlackRock]], Nuveen, Franklin Advisers, Whitebox, Taconic Capital, Vitol.

Holdout: [[GoldenTree Asset Management]] has opposed the plan.

### Political interference (Aug 2025)

President Trump dismissed 5 Democratic members of the [[FOMB]] (Fiscal Oversight and Management Board), then removed Republican Andrew Biggs (who called the dismissals "unjustified"), leaving a single member. Critics view this as an attempt to install allies of PREPA creditors who want better recovery terms.

## Pension crisis

PREPA pensions are underfunded. Governor [[Jenniffer González Colón]] and [[FOMB]] agreed to reprogram $25M in government funds for short-term pension payments (Apr 2025). Long-term solution remains unresolved.
