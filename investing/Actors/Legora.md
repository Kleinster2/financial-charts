## Product

Collaborative AI workspace for legal professionals:
- Document review and research with precision
- Drafting assistance
- Team collaboration features
- Built on [[Anthropic]] and [[OpenAI]] models with proprietary workflow layer

Differentiation vs [[Harvey]]: Legora emphasizes "collaborative" approach — working alongside firms from first interaction through full-scale rollout. Positions as a partner, not just a tool.

## Competitive position

Junestrand (LinkedIn, Feb 2026) on [[Anthropic]]'s Cowork launch: distinguished between a plug-in and operating a "collaborative, production-grade platform used by hundreds of the world's leading legal teams."

| Competitor | Legora advantage |
|------------|-----------------|
| [[Harvey]] | Collaborative partnership model vs tool model; similar tier of law firm clients |
| [[Anthropic]] (Cowork) | Production-grade legal workflows vs generic plug-ins |
| [[RELX]] / LexisNexis | Faster iteration, modern UX vs legacy platform |
| [[Luminance]] | Broader platform vs contract-focused |

See [[Horizontal vs vertical AI]] for the broader debate.

## Key clients

- [[Linklaters]] — Magic Circle firm
- [[Cleary Gottlieb]] — elite US firm
- [[Goodwin]] — major US firm
- [[MinterEllison]] — largest Australian firm

## Investment case

Bull:
- Fastest valuation growth in legal AI: $675M → $1.8B → $6B target in under a year
- 400+ clients in 40+ countries with rapid organic growth
- YC pedigree + top-tier investor syndicate (Bessemer, ICONIQ, GC, Benchmark)
- 25-year-old founder with extraordinary sales velocity
- Legal AI TAM is massive ($1T+ legal services industry)

Bear:
- $6B valuation on ~$265M raised — needs to justify with revenue (undisclosed)
- Built on Anthropic/OpenAI models — infrastructure dependency
- [[Harvey]] has deeper Big Law penetration and more funding ($1B+)
- [[RELX]] has the complete legal library neither startup can match
- Valuation tripling in 4 months feels frothy
