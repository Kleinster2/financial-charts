- Betting on Bitcoin appreciation

## Underperformance

**Lagging AI-pivot peers:**

| Company | 2025 YTD | Strategy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [[IREN]] | +300% | AI pivot |
| [[Cipher Mining]] | +230% | AI pivot |
| [[Hut 8]] | +139% | AI pivot |

- Simpler business model
- No AI execution risk
- BTC holdings = option value

**Bear case:**
