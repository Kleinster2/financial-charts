## Current situation

- Lost process leadership to [[TSMC]]
- [[AMD]] took significant CPU share
- [[NVIDIA]] dominates AI, Intel's Gaudi struggling
- Foundry transformation uncertain post-Gelsinger
- [[CHIPS Act]] beneficiary (~$8B)
- **NVIDIA partnership (Jan 2026)** — $5B investment + strategic collaboration
- **US government stake (~10%, Aug 2025)** — Trump administration took strategic position
- **Manufacturing yields disappointing (Jan 2026)** — can't fill server demand, Q1 guidance missed badly, stock -14% AH

---

## US government stake (Aug 2025)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Size | ~10% of Intel |
| Date | August 2025 |
| Administration | Trump |
| Context | Strategic national security investment |

Part of broader US semiconductor sovereignty push. Government directly backing Intel as domestic foundry alternative to [[TSMC]].

---

## [[Europe]] expansion shelved

| Project | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **[[Germany]] fab** | Shelved |
| **Poland facility** | Shelved |

Financial pressures and foundry transformation challenges led Intel to pause European expansion. Focus shifted to US facilities with CHIPS Act support.

---

## NVIDIA partnership (Jan 2026)

**Game-changing deal:**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Investment** | $5B in Intel stock @ $23.28/share |
| **Shares** | ~217.4 million |
| **Status** | FTC approved |
| **Stock reaction** | INTC +6.7% |

**Strategic collaboration:**
- Joint development of custom data center + PC products
- NVLink integration with Intel architectures
- Multi-generation partnership

**Why it matters:**
- Capital injection during financial stress
- Jensen backing Intel turnaround
- Potential foundry relationship (Intel 18A for NVIDIA?)
- EMIB packaging as CoWoS alternative
- US manufacturing / CHIPS Act alignment

See [[NVIDIA-Intel partnership]] for full analysis.

## Q4 2025 earnings (Jan 23, 2026)

**Beat on revenue, missed badly on guidance.** Stock -14% after hours (to $46.75).

| Metric | Q4 actual | Estimate | Q1 guidance | Q1 estimate |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Revenue | **$13.7B** (-4.1% YoY) | $13.4B | **$11.7-12.7B** | $12.6B |
| EPS (adj) | **$0.15** | $0.09 | **Break-even** | $0.08 |
| Gross margin (adj) | **37.9%** | — | **34.5%** | — |

**Segment breakdown (Q4):**

| Segment | Revenue | vs estimate |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Client Computing | $8.2B | Miss ($8.3B) |
| Data Center | $4.7B | Beat ($4.4B) |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | $4.5B (+3.8% YoY) | — |

**The problem — manufacturing yields:**
- Demand is "quite strong" but yields too low to fill orders
- Burned through inventory in Q4 — additional server chip supply not until end of Q1
- "Our yield and production manufacturing are not up to my standards" — Tan
- Can't shift production toward servers without hurting PC customers
- Higher memory prices may weaken laptop demand

**CapEx:** 2026 spend similar to 2025, but new machinery output boost not until 2027.

**Context:** Stock had surged 84% in 2025 (best SOX performer in Jan). NVIDIA $5B investment, US government ~10% stake, [[SoftBank]] investment — all built Wall Street enthusiasm. Annual revenue $53B vs $78B peak (2021).

**Analyst reaction:** Matt Bryson (Wedbush): "There's been a lot of optimism around Intel potentially turning a corner... Hearing that yields are difficult, that's not a great start."

**CFO Zinsner:** Current margins "by no means acceptable." Supply will increase each quarter in 2026.

## Intel 18A launch (Jan 27, 2026)

**TODAY:** 14 Core Ultra Series 3 SKUs available globally across 200+ PC designs.

| Spec | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Process** | Intel 18A (first chips) |
| **Top SKU** | 16 CPU cores, 12 Xe-cores, 50 [[NPU]] TOPS |
| **Multithread** | +60% vs prior gen |
| **[[Gaming]] (iGPU)** | +77% vs Lunar Lake |
| **Battery** | Up to 27 hours |
| **New tier** | Core Ultra X9/X7 — highest integrated Arc graphics |
| **Platform** | Mobile only (desktop stays on Arrow Lake) |
| **Edge systems** | Q2 2026 |

**Significance:** First 18A products shipping — "most advanced semiconductor process ever manufactured in the United States." Key turnaround milestone after years of process delays.

See [[CES 2026]] for event context.

## Technology position

| Node | Status |
|------|--------|
| Intel 18A (≈2nm) | 2025 ramp, 55% yield reported |
| Intel 20A | Skipped |
| Intel 4/3 | Current production |

Behind [[TSMC]] and [[Samsung]] on leading edge.

---

## Packaging opportunity (EMIB)

Intel's EMIB becoming a CoWoS alternative as TSMC capacity tightens:

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **EMIB** | 2.5D, cheaper than CoWoS, good thermal, mature |
| **Foveros** | 3D stacking |

**Who's looking:**
- [[Marvell]], [[MediaTek]] actively trying EMIB
- [[Apple]], [[Qualcomm]] adding "EMIB familiarity" to job posts
- Non-Intel customers already confirmed

**Strategic angle:** If front-end foundry can't win customers, packaging could be beachhead into AI supply chain.

**New model:** TSMC front-end + Intel back-end. US-based back-end solves domestic production requirements (TSMC back-end ships to [[Taiwan]]).

**Risk:** Window may be temporary — if Intel misses it, [[ASE]]/[[Amkor]]/SPIL take the overflow.

## Analyst coverage (Jan 2026)

| Date | Firm | Rating | Price target | Note |
|------|------|--------|--------------|------|
| Jan 14, 2026 | **KeyBanc** | Upgrade to **Overweight** | **$60** | NVIDIA partnership, 18A progress |

**Stock reaction:** +3.3% on upgrade.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | INTC (NASDAQ) |
| Price | ~$47 (post-earnings AH) |
| 2025 return | +84% |
| Annual revenue | $53B (vs $78B peak 2021) |
| HQ | Santa Clara, CA |
| Model | IDM (design + fabs) |
| Gross margin | 37.9% (Q4), 34.5% (Q1 guide) |

*Updated 2026-01-27*

## For theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Intel weakness = fewer competitors for Samsung
**[[Long WFE]]**: Intel fabs = equipment demand regardless of outcome
**[[Long OSAT and test equipment]]**: EMIB competes with traditional OSATs for CoWoS overflow — risk to ASE/[[Amkor]]
**[[Advanced packaging]]**: Intel could carve out niche in tier-2 AI packaging
