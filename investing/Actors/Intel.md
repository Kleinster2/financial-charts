**Intel** — U.S. semiconductor giant. IDM (integrated device manufacturer) with both design and fabs.

## Distinction from Intel Foundry Services

This note covers Intel as a company. For the foundry business specifically, see [[Intel Foundry Services]].

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Client Computing | PC CPUs (Core) |
| Data Center | Server CPUs (Xeon), AI (Gaudi) |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | External foundry business |
| Mobileye | Automotive (ADAS) |
| Altera | FPGAs (acquired) |

---

## Current situation

- Lost process leadership to [[TSMC]]
- [[AMD]] took significant CPU share
- [[NVIDIA]] dominates AI, Intel's Gaudi struggling
- Foundry transformation uncertain post-Gelsinger
- [[CHIPS Act]] beneficiary (~$8B)

---

## Technology position

| Node | Status |
|------|--------|
| Intel 18A (≈2nm) | 2025 ramp, 55% yield reported |
| Intel 20A | Skipped |
| Intel 4/3 | Current production |

Behind [[TSMC]] and [[Samsung]] on leading edge.

## Packaging opportunity (EMIB)

Intel's EMIB becoming a CoWoS alternative as TSMC capacity tightens:

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **EMIB** | 2.5D, cheaper than CoWoS, good thermal, mature |
| **Foveros** | 3D stacking |

**Who's looking:**
- Marvell, [[MediaTek]] actively trying EMIB
- Apple, Qualcomm adding "EMIB familiarity" to job posts
- Non-Intel customers already confirmed

**Strategic angle:** If front-end foundry can't win customers, packaging could be beachhead into AI supply chain.

**New model:** TSMC front-end + Intel back-end. US-based back-end solves domestic production requirements (TSMC back-end ships to Taiwan).

**Risk:** Window may be temporary — if Intel misses it, [[ASE]]/Amkor/SPIL take the overflow.

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | INTC (NASDAQ) |
| HQ | Santa Clara, CA |
| Model | IDM (design + fabs) |
| 2nm yield | ~55% (vs TSMC 65%, Samsung 40%) |

---

## For theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Intel weakness = fewer competitors for Samsung
**[[Long WFE]]**: Intel fabs = equipment demand regardless of outcome
**[[Long OSAT and test equipment]]**: EMIB competes with traditional OSATs for CoWoS overflow — risk to ASE/Amkor
**[[Advanced packaging]]**: Intel could carve out niche in tier-2 AI packaging
