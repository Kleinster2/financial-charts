## Why ServiceNow matters

Platform of platforms — ServiceNow connects enterprise systems. Started in ITSM (help desk, incident management), expanded to HR, customer service, security, and now [[AI agents]]. The platform becomes more valuable as more workflows run through it.

Enterprise lock-in — 98%+ renewal rates. Once ServiceNow manages your workflows, switching costs are enormous. 85% of Fortune 500 are customers.

AI monetization — Now Assist (gen AI across platform) drives upsell to existing 8,100+ customers. Shifting to consumption-based pricing for AI features.

## Recent M&A

| Acquisition   | Price       | Date | Strategic rationale              |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| [[Armis]]     | $7.75B cash | Dec 2025 | OT/IoT cybersecurity, device visibility |
| [[Moveworks]] | $2.85B      | Mar 2025 | Conversational AI for IT         |
| [[Genesys]] investment | $750M | 2025 | Contact center software |
| [[Veza]]      | Undisclosed | 2025 | Identity security platform       |

Total 2025 M&A/investment spend: $12B+ across 9 deals (6 without disclosed prices).

### Deal spree concerns

[[Bill McDermott]]'s acquisition pace drawing comparisons to his SAP tenure (2010-2019), where he engineered SAP's largest-ever deals including the $8B [[Qualtrics]] purchase — months after telling CNBC big acquisitions weren't on the horizon.

| Analyst | Firm | View |
|---------|------|------|
| Matthew Hedberg | RBC Capital Markets | Unhappy deal may be used to boost slowing revenue growth |
| John DiFucci | Guggenheim | "Deja vu" — buying spree looks like rehabilitating slowing growth inorganically vs savvy tuck-ins |

ServiceNow response: comparing to SAP is "apples to oranges" — ServiceNow doesn't need M&A for market traction. Strategy "fundamentally unchanged."

Stock reaction: NOW was already -18% YTD before Armis news broke (Dec 13), then dropped another -12% after. Wall Street expected sub-20% organic revenue growth in 2026 — acquisitions seen as compensating.

## SaaSpocalypse impact (Feb 2026)

[[ServiceNow]] became one of the highest-profile casualties of the [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]]. The stock shed ~$100B in market cap over the prior year, falling from its ~$218B peak. After McDermott defended ServiceNow's AI positioning on the Q4 earnings call (Jan 28), the stock fell another 22% as the SaaSpocalypse unfolded — hitting -35% YTD by late February.

The bear case crystallized around "long-term disaggregation risk" ([[RBC]]'s Rishi Jaluria): if AI agents become the primary workflow interface, ServiceNow risks becoming a back-end service provider rather than the platform layer. IT budget diversion toward AI spending also makes traditional software cross-selling harder.

ServiceNow's defense: governance controls, security infrastructure, and business context that standalone AI agents cannot replicate. CFO Mastantuono argued that agents need a trusted enterprise platform to operate within — and ServiceNow's 98%+ retention, 85% Fortune 500 penetration, and workflow depth make it the natural host.

AI revenue reality: ~$600M annual run rate (ahead of internal targets), but only ~3.75% of expected ~$16B FY2026 total revenue. The market is pricing in disruption faster than AI revenue can replace traditional subscription value.

The Feb 24 [[Anthropic]] reversal — partnership announcements suggesting AI augments rather than replaces enterprise software — provided a temporary bounce. But the structural question remains open.

## Competitive position

| Competitor | Focus | ServiceNow advantage |
|------------|-------|---------------------|

| [[Microsoft]] | Copilot, Dynamics | Platform independence |
| BMC | Legacy ITSM | Modern architecture |
| [[Atlassian]] | Dev tools, ITSM (Jira) | Enterprise scale |
| Freshworks | SMB service management | Enterprise relationships |

ServiceNow has 40%+ ITSM market share. Main threat is [[Salesforce]] expanding from CRM into workflows.
