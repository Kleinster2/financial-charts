## Macrohard

**"Purely AI software company" (Aug 2025):**

Musk's vision: simulate a Microsoft-scale software business entirely with AI agents.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Trademark | Filed Aug 1, 2025 |
| Name | Tongue-in-cheek Microsoft jab |
| Concept | AI agents running entire software company |
| Products | Code generation, workflow automation, agents |

**Musk quote:** "In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI."

**Business model:**
- Licensable AI frameworks
- Like Microsoft Windows licensing
- Competing with Azure, AWS, GCP
- Lower barrier for AI-driven companies

## Infrastructure

### Colossus (Memphis)
- Current: 100k H100s
- Branded as "Macrohard" on roof
- One of highest single-site AI compute capacities in US

### Colossus 2 / MACROHARDRR (Tennessee)
- Third building purchased
- Named "MACROHARDRR"
- 2GW total capacity target
- Location chosen for TVA power access (BYOP strategy)
- See [[Power constraints]]

**Musk claim:** "More AI compute than everyone else combined within five years"
