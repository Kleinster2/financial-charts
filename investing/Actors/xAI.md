**xAI** — Elon Musk's AI company (Grok). Building massive GPU clusters, potential [[Samsung]] anchor.

---

## Relevance to semis

xAI is emerging as a major AI infrastructure builder. Colossus cluster and expansion plans make them a significant chip buyer.

---

## Infrastructure

### Colossus (Memphis)
- Current: 100k H100s
- Expansion: 1M+ GPUs planned

### Colossus 2 (Tennessee)
- 400MW near-term
- 2GW path
- Location chosen for TVA power access (BYOP strategy)
- See [[Power constraints]]

---

## Samsung connection

Musk controls both [[Tesla]] and xAI. Combined, they could be a major anchor customer for [[Samsung]] Taylor fab.

This is one of the "customer win" scenarios that validates the Korea thesis.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founder | Elon Musk |
| Product | Grok (LLM) |
| Current GPUs | [[NVIDIA]] H100/Blackwell |
| Potential foundry | [[Samsung]] (via Tesla relationship) |

---

## For theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Musk as Samsung anchor = bullish Korea
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Emerging tier 2 hyperscaler
**[[Long TSMC]]**: Current GPUs = TSMC (via NVIDIA)
