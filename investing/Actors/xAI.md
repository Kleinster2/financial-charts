**xAI** — Elon Musk's AI company (Grok). Building massive GPU clusters. Macrohard project to simulate Microsoft with AI.

---

## Relevance to semis

xAI is emerging as a major AI infrastructure builder. Colossus cluster and expansion plans make them a significant chip buyer.

## Macrohard

**"Purely AI software company" (Aug 2025):**

Musk's vision: simulate a Microsoft-scale software business entirely with AI agents.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Trademark | Filed Aug 1, 2025 |
| Name | Tongue-in-cheek Microsoft jab |
| Concept | AI agents running entire software company |
| Products | Code generation, workflow automation, agents |

**Musk quote:** "In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI."

**Business model:**
- Licensable AI frameworks
- Like Microsoft Windows licensing
- Competing with Azure, AWS, GCP
- Lower barrier for AI-driven companies

## Infrastructure

### Colossus (Memphis)
- Current: 100k H100s
- Branded as "Macrohard" on roof
- One of highest single-site AI compute capacities in US

### Colossus 2 / MACROHARDRR (Tennessee)
- Third building purchased
- Named "MACROHARDRR"
- 2GW total capacity target
- Location chosen for TVA power access (BYOP strategy)
- See [[Power constraints]]

### Mississippi expansion
- Third building across state line from Memphis
- Investment: **$20B+** per Gov. Tate Reeves
- Brings total capacity to ~2GW

**Musk claim:** "More AI compute than everyone else combined within five years"

## Financials (2025)

**Bloomberg reported (Jan 2026):**

| Quarter | Revenue | Gross Profit | EBITDA | Net Loss |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | $43M | $14M | -$612M | ~$1.0B |

| **Jan-Sep** | **$208M** | **$90M** | **-$2.4B** | — |

- **Cash burn:** $7.8B in first 9 months of 2025
- **Stock-based comp:** ~$160M through September
- **Revenue target:** $500M for 2025 → tracking ~$280M annualized (will miss)
- **EBITDA projection:** -$2.2B for full year → already -$2.4B through Sep (exceeded losses)
- Revenue nearly doubled Q2→Q3; gross margin improving

## $20B off-balance-sheet SPV (Oct 2025)

**Structure:** xAI financing Nvidia GPUs through an SPV — debt stays off xAI's balance sheet.

| Component | Party | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Lead equity** | [[Valor Equity Partners]] (Antonio Gracias) | SPV sponsor |
| **Debt** | [[Apollo]] | Investment-grade lender |
| **Chips** | [[NVIDIA]] | Equity investor + chip supplier |
| **Lessee** | xAI | **5-year lease commitment only** |

**How it works:**
1. SPV is a legal entity separate from xAI
2. SPV buys Nvidia chips with Apollo debt + Valor/Nvidia equity
3. SPV rents chips exclusively to xAI
4. **xAI's only commitment: 5-year lease** — nothing else on balance sheet

**Why this matters:**
- xAI has limits on how much secured debt it can borrow
- SPV structure allows billions in GPU financing without balance sheet impact
- Model being copied by other AI companies

See [[AI infrastructure financing]].

## Samsung connection

Musk controls both [[Tesla]] and xAI. Combined, they could be a major anchor customer for [[Samsung]] Taylor fab.

This is one of the "customer win" scenarios that validates the Korea thesis.
