# Graff

Ultra-luxury diamond house, vertically integrated from mine to retail — founded 1960 by Laurence Graff in London. ~$900M revenue (2024), ~60-70 boutiques across 6 continents. Privately held: Laurence Graff 60%, ex-wife Anne-Marie 40% (Laurence retains operational control). Francois Graff (son) serves as CEO.

Graff's defining edge is full vertical integration — it sources rough diamonds (via [[SAFDICO]], its 51%-owned mining subsidiary), cuts and polishes in-house (Johannesburg, Antwerp, New York, [[Botswana]], Mauritius), and retails through owned boutiques. No other major high jeweler controls the full pipeline. Average transaction ~$400K, far above peers.

## Competitive position

| Jeweler | Parent | Revenue | Differentiator |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Graff | Private | ~$900M | Full vertical integration, exceptional stones |
| [[Harry Winston]] | [[Swatch Group]] | ~$1B est. | "King of Diamonds" heritage, gem-led |
| Cartier | [[Richemont]] | Part of EUR 14B+ | Broadest range, iconic motifs, mass-to-ultra |
| Van Cleef & Arpels | [[Richemont]] | Part of Richemont | Alhambra, poetic design |
| [[Tiffany]] | [[LVMH]] | ~$4.7B | Broadest distribution, lower entry point |
| [[Bulgari]] | [[LVMH]] | ~$3B est. | Italian design, colored stones, hotels |
| [[Chopard]] | Private (Scheufele) | ~$1B est. | Watches + high jewelry, ethical gold |

Graff's ultra-high average transaction (~$400K) places it above all listed competitors. The trade-off: narrow distribution and lower brand awareness vs. LVMH/Richemont-backed houses.

## Investment implications

Not investable (private, family-controlled), but matters as:
- Bellwether for ultra-high-net-worth jewelry demand
- Competitor to [[Richemont]] (Cartier), [[LVMH]] ([[Tiffany]], [[Bulgari]])
- Vertical integration model is unique — if it ever IPOs again, it would be a distinctive asset
- Laurence Graff net worth GBP 3.65B (#44 Sunday Times Rich List 2025)
