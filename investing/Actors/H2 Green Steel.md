## The technology

### Traditional steel vs green steel

| Process | Traditional | H2 Green Steel |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Reductant | Coal/coke | **Green hydrogen** |
| CO2 emissions | ~2 tonnes CO2/tonne steel | **Near zero** |
| Energy source | Fossil fuels | Renewable electricity |
| Byproduct | CO2 | Water |

### How it works

1. Renewable electricity (Swedish hydro/wind) powers electrolyzers
2. Electrolyzers split water into hydrogen and oxygen
3. Hydrogen reduces iron ore to iron (instead of coal)
4. Iron processed into steel with minimal CO2

## Boden plant

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Location | Boden, northern Sweden |
| Electrolyzer capacity | **700 MW** |
| Steel capacity | 2.5M tonnes initially → 5M tonnes |
| Production start | Late 2025 (target) |
| Power source | Swedish renewable grid |

**Why Boden:** Cheap, abundant renewable electricity from hydro; proximity to iron ore deposits.
