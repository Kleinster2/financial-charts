## Why Trane matters for AI

**Aggressive DC positioning:**

| Move | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **NVIDIA reference design** | First comprehensive thermal management for gigawatt-scale AI factories |
| **Stellar Energy acquisition** | Acquired liquid-to-chip cooling specialist (early 2026) |
| **Record backlog** | $7.8B as of late 2025 |

## Data center products

| Product | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Precision cooling | Traditional air-cooled DC |
| Liquid cooling | Direct-to-chip (via Stellar) |
| Chiller systems | Large-scale cooling |
| NVIDIA AI Factory reference | Integrated thermal management |

---

## The Stellar acquisition

**Stellar Energy Digital** — liquid-to-chip cooling specialist acquired early 2026.

Gives Trane direct-to-chip capabilities to complement air-cooled portfolio. Critical as AI racks exceed 100 kW where air cooling fails.
