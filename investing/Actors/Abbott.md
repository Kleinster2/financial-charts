## Why Abbott matters

**CGM market leader.** Abbott's FreeStyle Libre franchise achieved its third consecutive year of billion-dollar growth. The system dominates consumer CGM with broad adoption across diabetic and non-diabetic users tracking metabolic health.

**Diagnostic breadth.** From rapid COVID tests (BinaxNOW) to core laboratory systems to point-of-care diagnostics, Abbott touches most of the diagnostic value chain.

**Exact Sciences acquisition.** In November 2025, Abbott announced acquisition of Exact Sciences, positioning it to lead in cancer diagnostics. Expected to close Q2 2026.
