**AMEC (Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc)** — China's leading etch equipment maker. Lam Research competitor.

---

## Why AMEC matters

AMEC is China's most advanced etch equipment company — critical for chip manufacturing:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Focus | Plasma etch, MOCVD |
| H1 2025 revenue | 5B yuan (+44% YoY) |
| Patents filed 2025 | 259 |
| Key segment | Dielectric and conductor etch |

## 50% domestic mandate beneficiary

Like [[Naura Technology]], AMEC benefits from China's 50% domestic equipment mandate:

- Captive market for Chinese fabs
- SMIC, Hua Hong, etc. must source locally
- Etch is critical process step — high value

---

## Technology position

**Etch capability:**
- Dielectric etch (competitive at mature nodes)
- Conductor etch (catching up)
- 3D NAND etch (making progress)

**Vs Lam Research:**
- Lam still leads on advanced nodes
- AMEC competitive at 28nm+
- Gap narrowing with R&D investment

**MOCVD:**
- LED manufacturing equipment
- Secondary business line

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Etch is high-value, critical process
- 50% mandate = guaranteed demand
- Most advanced Chinese etch capability
- Strong R&D trajectory

**Bear:**
- Still behind Lam/Applied at leading edge
- A-share listing (foreign access issues)
- Dependent on policy support
- If geopolitics ease, Western tools preferred
