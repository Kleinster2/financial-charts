## Career Arc

Benedict Evans has spent 20+ years analyzing technology, mobile, and media across multiple roles. His early career included stints in equity research (sell-side tech coverage) and strategy consulting, giving him both analytical rigor and business-model fluency.

He gained wide attention through his blog and newsletter in the early 2010s, writing deeply about the [[smartphone]] revolution, [[mobile]] platform economics, and the structural shifts from desktop to mobile computing. His writing caught the attention of [[Marc Andreessen]], and he joined [[Andreessen Horowitz]] as a partner around 2014.

At [[Andreessen Horowitz|a16z]], Evans spent roughly six years working across the firm's portfolio while producing his widely-read annual tech trends presentations — sprawling 100+ slide decks that became essential reading across Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and corporate strategy teams.

Around 2020, he returned to London and joined [[Mosaic Ventures]] and [[Entrepreneur First]] as a venture partner, while continuing his independent writing, newsletter, and presentations.

## Key Theses & Frameworks

### "Mobile is Eating the World"
Evans was one of the earliest and clearest voices on the idea that [[smartphone|smartphones]] would become the dominant computing platform, surpassing PCs in reach, usage, and economic importance. He tracked global smartphone adoption curves and argued that mobile wasn't just a "small screen" but a fundamentally different computing paradigm.

### Platform Shifts & S-Curves
A recurring Evans framework: technology evolves through [[S-curve|S-curves]] of adoption. Each new platform (mainframe → PC → web → mobile → AI?) starts slowly, grows explosively, then matures. The strategic question is always: "What's the next S-curve, and who captures value?"

### "What Comes After Smartphones?"
In recent years, Evans has focused on post-smartphone questions — the role of [[AI]], [[machine learning]], [[augmented reality]], and new interaction paradigms. He's skeptical of simple narratives ("AI replaces everything") and emphasizes that new technologies create new questions more than simple answers.

### Regulation & Tech Power
Evans writes extensively on [[antitrust]], content moderation, and tech regulation. He argues many regulatory proposals misunderstand how technology markets work and that the conversation needs more nuance about market definition, switching costs, and consumer welfare.

### Annual Trends Presentation
His signature output: a massive annual slide deck (often 100-150 slides) covering the state of tech — data on adoption curves, market sizes, platform shifts, emerging trends. These decks are shared hundreds of thousands of times and serve as a baseline reference for the industry.

## Track Record

### Hits ✅
- Mobile dominance thesis — nailed the smartphone revolution's scale and economic impact
- Platform economics analysis — correctly identified how [[Apple]] and [[Google]] would dominate mobile ecosystems
- Skepticism on "TV is dead" — nuanced view that legacy media would transform rather than vanish overnight
- E-commerce share of retail — consistently provided grounded, data-driven analysis vs hype
- Early identification of AI as next platform shift — began framing [[AI]] as the next S-curve well before the [[ChatGPT]] moment

### Misses ❌
- Less of a stock-picker/market caller — his frameworks are structural, not tactical. Harder to point to specific "wrong calls"
- Crypto/Web3 skepticism — was largely dismissive, which was right on timing but may miss long-term applications
- European tech optimism — has been constructive on European tech, which has underperformed US for a decade
- Some regulation analysis seen as too sympathetic to Big Tech by critics
