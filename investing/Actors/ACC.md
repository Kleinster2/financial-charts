# ACC (Automotive Cells Company)

**European battery JV** — founded 2020 by [[Stellantis]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[TotalEnergies]] to build EV battery gigafactories in Europe. Planned three sites: Douvrin ([[France]]), Kaiserslautern ([[Germany]]), and Termoli ([[Italy]]). Germany and Italy projects definitively shelved Feb 2026 as [[Stellantis]] retreats from aggressive EV plans.

## Gigafactory plans

| Site | Country | Capacity (planned) | Status |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Douvrin (Billy-Berclau) | [[France]] | ~13 GWh | Operational, partial unemployment talks (Feb 2026) |
| Kaiserslautern | [[Germany]] | ~24 GWh | **Shelved** — standby May 2024, definitively cancelled Feb 2026 |
| Termoli | [[Italy]] | ~24 GWh | **Shelved** — standby May 2024, definitively cancelled Feb 2026 |

ACC stated "prerequisites to restart" the German and Italian projects were not expected to be met. French site maintained but in discussions with unions on partial unemployment measures.

## Context

ACC's retreat fits a broader pattern of European battery champion failures:
- [[Northvolt]] — Swedish battery startup, filed bankruptcy Nov 2024
- [[LG Energy Solution]] — paused US Ultium plants (Ohio, Tennessee) Jan 2026
- [[Stellantis]] — €22.2B writedowns (Feb 2026), pivoting from BEV to EREV/hybrid

European automakers overestimated BEV adoption pace and underestimated [[China]]'s battery cost advantage ([[CATL]], [[BYD]] dominate with LFP at lower cost).
