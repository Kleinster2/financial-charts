**Kachin Independence Army** — Myanmar rebel group. Controls ~50% of global dysprosium/terbium mining. Captured Pangwa Oct 2024. All output must go to [[China]] for processing.

## Why KIA matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founded | 1961 |
| Territory | Kachin State, Myanmar |
| REE control | **Nearly all Myanmar mines** |
| Global Dy/Tb share | **~50% of mining** |
| Processing capacity | **Zero** — must ship to [[China]] |

## Rare earth control

**Oct 2024 — Captured Pangwa:**
- Major rare earth mining area near [[China]] border
- Former warlord Zahkung Ting Ying's territory
- KIA now controls nearly all Myanmar REE mines

**Strategic position:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Myanmar global REE rank | **#3** (after [[China]], US) |
| Dy/Tb share | ~50% of global mining |
| [[China]] import share | 50% by value |

**The catch:** No processing capacity. All material must go to [[China]] → no leverage over global markets directly.

---

## [[China]] relationship

**Border closure (late 2024):**
- [[China]] unhappy with KIA victory
- Closed border, halted supplies
- REE imports dropped **90%**

**April 2025 resumption:**
- ~5,000 tons crossed border
- Suggests [[China]]-KIA understanding reached
- KIA dependent on [[China]] as sole buyer

## Supply chain exposure

**Global Witness found links to major manufacturers:**

| Company | Response |
|---------|----------|
| [[Ford]] | No comment |
| [[Hyundai]] | No comment |
| [[Tesla]] | No comment |
| [[Volkswagen]] | No comment |
| Vestas | No comment |
| **[[Siemens]]** | Claims due diligence framework |

**Nabeel Mancheri (ex-Global Rare Earth Industry Association):** Chinese magnet manufacturers "always say, 'No, we are not using any heavy rare earths coming from Myanmar.' That is a lie and cannot be possible."

## Mining operations

**In-situ leaching method:**
- Pumps chemicals into hillsides
- Toxic, environmentally devastating
- "Severe contamination" found (Naresuan University study)
- Workers handle chemicals with minimal protection
- 15 workers killed in landslide (2024)

**Labor:**
- Chinese miners paid 2x local workers
- Locals given more hazardous jobs
- Wages cut, paydays skipped under warlord rule

---

## Political context

**Myanmar civil war:**
- Military junta vs hundreds of armed groups
- KIA fighting for Kachin ethnic minority autonomy since 1961
- Experienced in mountain warfare
- Opaque leadership, aging generals

**National Unity Government (exile):**
- Trying to court US support
- Pitching future rare earth access
- Maw Htun Aung advising KIA on geopolitical position

---

## Investment implications

**For rare earth thesis:**
- Myanmar supply = critical but unstable
- All flows through [[China]] anyway
- KIA control doesn't change [[China]]'s processing monopoly
- Conflict/instability = supply disruption risk

**Ryan Castilloux (Adamas Intelligence):** "Five years from now, we will look back on this and say, 'Oh, I can't believe that happened.'"
