**Lyten** — American lithium-sulfur battery and advanced materials company. $625M+ raised, backed by [[Stellantis]], [[FedEx]], [[Honeywell]]. Proprietary 3D graphene platform. **Acquired most of [[Northvolt]]'s assets** in 2025 bankruptcy — including Skellefteå gigafactory, Poland plant, and IP portfolio. Potential [[US Export-Import Bank]] financing of $650M for Nevada facility.

## Technology

### [[Lithium]]-sulfur batteries

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **No cobalt/nickel** | Avoids critical mineral supply chains |
| **Higher energy density** | Theoretical 2-3x lithium-ion |
| **Lighter weight** | Sulfur is lighter than metal oxides |
| **Lower cost potential** | Abundant raw materials |

### 3D graphene platform

Proprietary manufacturing process for three-dimensional graphene structures. Applications beyond batteries: composites, sensors.

## Northvolt acquisition (2025)

Lyten emerged as the primary acquirer of [[Northvolt]]'s bankrupt assets.

| Asset | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Northvolt Ett** | Skellefteå gigafactory (Sweden) |
| **Poland plant** | Battery energy storage manufacturing |
| **IP portfolio** | Patents, trade secrets |

**Strategic logic:** Lyten gains European manufacturing footprint + established infrastructure for fraction of build cost.

## Applications

| Sector | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| **EVs** | Lighter, cheaper battery packs |
| **[[Aerospace]]** | Weight-sensitive applications |
| **Logistics** | Delivery vehicles (FedEx) |
| **[[Grid storage]]** | Stationary storage (via Northvolt assets) |

## [[Lithium]]-sulfur vs lithium-ion

| Metric | Li-S | Li-ion |
|--------|------|--------|
| Energy density | Higher (theoretical) | Established |
| Cycle life | Lower (challenge) | Higher |
| Cost | Lower (potential) | Declining |
| Materials | Sulfur (abundant) | Cobalt, nickel (constrained) |
| Maturity | Emerging | Mature |

**Challenge:** [[Lithium]]-sulfur historically suffered from poor cycle life. Lyten claims its 3D graphene architecture solves this.
