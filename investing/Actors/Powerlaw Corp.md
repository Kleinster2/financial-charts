## Listing structure

Filing to list 43.2M shares of common stock for resale by existing stockholders — not a traditional underwritten IPO. Stifel will determine when shares are ready to trade and approve opening price. Still needs SEC approval.

Strategy: [[Akkadian Ventures]] specializes in buying secondary market shares in private companies from existing backers, then packaging into fund vehicles.

---

## Why it matters

Retail investors have been largely shut out of the AI private company boom. [[OpenAI]] discussing fundraising at up to $830B valuation, [[SpaceX]] at $1.25T (with xAI), [[Anthropic]] at $380B — all private. PWRL would be one of the first pure-play listed vehicles giving individual investors exposure to this cohort.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Rare retail access to top private AI/defense/space companies
- Portfolio concentrated in highest-profile names (OpenAI, SpaceX, Anthropic, Anduril)
- If any holdings IPO, fund benefits from markup to public market valuations

Bear:
- Closed-end funds typically trade at discount to NAV
- Secondary market purchase prices may already reflect premium valuations
- Illiquid underlying holdings — difficult to mark accurately
- Management fees on top of already-expensive private stakes
- No control or board seats — pure passive exposure
