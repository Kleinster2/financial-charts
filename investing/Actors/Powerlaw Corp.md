## Listing structure

Direct listing — filing to list 43.2M shares of common stock for resale by existing stockholders. Not a traditional underwritten IPO; no new capital raised. Stifel determines when shares are ready to trade and approves opening price.

Reverse stock split Dec 23, 2025: every 12 shares consolidated into 1.

Selling stockholders: up to 103.9M shares (20% of outstanding) registered for resale. Largest: PowerLaw10 Cayman, LP with 55.2M shares (10.64%).

### Lock-up schedule (directors, officers, certain stockholders)

| Milestone | Cumulative % released |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Listing date | 25% |
| Day 30 | 45% |
| Day 90 | 70% |
| Day 180 | 100% |

Dynamic adjustment: if average closing price for 10 trading days before a release date exceeds 400% of NAV, tranche increases by 5% of outstanding. If below 200% of NAV, tranche decreases by 5%. Minimum tranche at Day 90/180 is 20%.

## Fee structure

| Fee | Rate | Details |
|-----|------|---------|
| Management fee | 2.50% annually | On average gross assets (includes leverage). Payable quarterly. |
| Performance fee | None | No carried interest at fund level |
| Other expenses | 1.13% of net assets | Accounting, legal, audit, administrator, transfer agent, custodian, directors' fees |
| Total annual expenses | 3.63% of net assets | |

Management fee payable regardless of performance — even if NAV declines. Computed on gross assets (including any borrowed amounts), not net.

For comparison: [[Destiny Tech100]] undisclosed, [[Robinhood]] Ventures 2.0% (1.0% first 6 months), [[Fundrise]] Innovation Fund 1.85%. PWRL is the most expensive among peers.

---

## NAV methodology

NAV computed quarterly (not daily like mutual funds).

- Board designated the Adviser ([[Akkadian Ventures|Akkadian CEF Manager]]) as valuation designee under Rule 2a-5
- Private/illiquid securities: fair value determined by the Adviser per Board-approved procedures. Factors: portfolio company earnings, market comparisons, recent secondary transaction pricing, DCFs, comparable public company valuations
- Forward contracts: fair valued based on recently observed transactions, adjusted for credit risk, share ratio, SPV fees
- SPV investments: value equals estimated fair value of underlying securities, discounted for SPV-level fees
- Independent third-party valuation firms may be engaged at Board's direction
- ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurements) framework

Conflict: The Adviser determines valuations and earns a management fee based on those valuations. Interested Directors are associated with the Adviser.

## Governance

5 directors: 3 independent, 2 interested. Classified board with staggered 3-year terms.

Independent:
- Vivian Chow (Board Chair, Audit Chair) — former SVP/CAO [[DocuSign]] (8 yrs), former VP/Controller [[Electronic Arts|EA]]; board member [[LiveRamp]] (NYSE: RAMP). $95K/yr
- Nicholas Earl (Compensation Chair) — CEO [[Glu Mobile]] (sold to EA for $2.4B); former SVP EA Mobile. $67.5K/yr
- Lars Leckie (Nominating Chair) — MD Aspenwood Ventures; MD Hummer Winblad (20 yrs). $67.5K/yr

Interested:
- Benjamin Black (CIO) — Co-Founder/MD [[Akkadian Ventures]] since 2011; JD Cornell
- Michael Dinsdale (President & CEO) — MD Akkadian since 2021; former CFO [[Gusto]] (2017–2020), CFO [[DocuSign]] (2010–2016); CFA

Officers: Peter Smith (CCO & Treasurer, co-founder Akkadian), Angela Stanley (COO & Secretary, since 2024).

Key ownership:

| Entity | Shares | % |
|--------|--------|---|
| Akkadian PowerLaw10 Series (Corient Private Access) | 128.3M | 24.7% |
| PowerLaw10 Cayman, LP | 55.2M | 10.6% |
| All officers & directors combined | 45.1M | 8.7% |

Anti-takeover: Classified board, removal only for cause by 2/3 supermajority, no cumulative voting, Board has exclusive bylaw amendment power, 80% vote required for open-end conversion or liquidation. Maryland Business Combination Act applies.

## Tax treatment

Intends to elect RIC status (taxable year ending Jul 31, 2026). Must distribute at least 90% of investment company taxable income annually to maintain status. If RIC qualification fails, subject to corporate income tax on all income.

Distributions of taxable income: ordinary income. Capital gain dividends: long-term capital gains rate (max 20%). Opt-out DRIP: distributions automatically reinvested unless stockholder opts out — still taxable.

No regular distributions anticipated — fund focuses on capital appreciation.

---

## Risk factors

Structure:
- Newly formed entity, limited operating history
- Non-diversified — can concentrate heavily in single issuers (top 2 positions up to 25% each)
- Direct listing with no underwriter or price stabilization
- Management fee payable even if NAV declines
- Quarterly NAV only — stale pricing between calculations
- Adviser sets valuations and earns fees on those valuations

Investments:
- All investments in private, illiquid securities
- Forward contract risk — counterparties may default; portfolio companies may actively obstruct transactions
- SPV layering adds structural complexity
- Drag-along rights — majority shareholders can force fund to sell at unfavorable prices
- Lock-up provisions (typically 180 days post-IPO of underlying holdings)
- Technology sector concentration — all holdings in tech
- Limited financial information available on private companies
- Portfolio companies may not recognize or approve the fund's investment and may seek to invalidate it

Precedent: [[Linqto]], a similar platform offering pre-IPO equity to retail investors, filed Chapter 11 in Jul 2025. Held >$500M in securities, 11,000+ customers. Found to have structured investments through SPVs owned by the company itself, sold [[Ripple]] shares at markups above SEC-permitted 10% cap.

## Competitive landscape

PWRL is one of four major vehicles giving retail investors exposure to private AI/tech companies. See also [[Destiny Tech100]], [[Robinhood]] Ventures (RVI), [[Fundrise]] Innovation Fund (VCX).

| Feature | PWRL | [[Destiny Tech100\|DXYZ]] | RVI ([[Robinhood]]) | VCX (Fundrise) |
|---------|------|------|-----|-----|
| Exchange | Nasdaq (pending) | [[NYSE]] (live since Mar 2024) | [[NYSE]] (filing) | [[NYSE]] (approved, expected Mar 2026) |
| NAV | ~$475M | ~$20/share | $1B target | ~$457M |
| Management fee | 2.50% | Undisclosed | 2.00% (1.00% first 6mo) | 1.85% |
| Holds OpenAI | Yes ($114.4M) | Yes | No | Yes |
| Holds SpaceX | Yes ($39.8M) | Yes (~25% of assets) | No | Yes |
| Holds Anthropic | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| # Holdings | 18 | 23 | ~7+ | 7+ core |
| Listing type | Direct listing (resale) | IPO (2024) | IPO ($25/share) | Evergreen conversion |
| Investors | 596 record holders | Public | Public | 74,000+ |

DXYZ trades at ~41% premium to NAV ($28.10 vs $19.97 NAV, Feb 2026). 52-week range $19.71–$53.52.

RVI announced Feb 17, 2026 — same day as PWRL story. Holdings: Airwallex, Boom, [[Databricks]], Mercor, Oura, Ramp, Revolut. Notably absent: SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic.

Fundrise VCX: shareholders approved NYSE listing; expected Mar 2026. 2025 return ~43.5%. Holdings: OpenAI, SpaceX, Anthropic, Databricks, Anduril, Ramp, Stripe (~75% of fund).

## Why it matters

Retail investors have been largely shut out of the AI private company boom. [[OpenAI]] discussing fundraising at up to $830B valuation, [[SpaceX]] at $1.25T (with xAI), [[Anthropic]] at $380B — all private. US public companies fell from ~7,000 in 2000 to ~4,000 in 2024. The best-performing companies are staying private longer, locking retail out of the highest-growth period.

PWRL would be among the first pure-play listed vehicles for this exposure, but faces the highest fee load (3.63% total) and the valuation conflict inherent in adviser-set NAV.

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Rare retail access to top private AI/defense/space companies
- Portfolio concentrated in highest-profile names (OpenAI, SpaceX, Anthropic, Anduril)
- If any holdings IPO, fund benefits from markup to public market valuations
- Akkadian has 15-year track record, 750+ secondary transactions, zero counterparty defaults

Bear:
- Closed-end funds typically trade at discount to NAV (DXYZ is an exception — 41% premium)
- Highest fee load among peers (3.63% total expenses vs 1.85% for Fundrise)
- Adviser determines NAV and earns fees on that NAV — structural conflict
- Illiquid underlying holdings — quarterly NAV only
- No control or board seats — pure passive exposure
- No distributions anticipated — pure capital appreciation play
- Direct listing means no underwriter price stabilization
- Linqto bankruptcy as cautionary precedent for retail private-market vehicles
