## Margin trajectory

Structural margin expansion over the past two years:

| Period | Gross Margin | Net Margin |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| FY2023 | ~36.8% | 3.8% |
| FY2024 | ~38.1% | 4.9% |
| TTM (Sep 2025) | ~38.8% | 5.9% |

10-year gross margin range: 29.3% (low) to 38.8% (current high). Drivers: reduced promotional activity, improved shrink, self-distribution of fresh meat/seafood, private label growth.

---

## Business model

Fresh-focused: perishables (produce, meat, seafood, dairy) ~57% of sales. Produce alone ~20%. Farmers-market-style open layouts.

Attribute-driven products: organic, vegan, grass-fed, keto, non-GMO. Targets the "health enthusiast" customer — higher-income households with children in affluent areas.

Rapid product innovation: ~7,100 new items/year (~35% assortment refresh annually).

Private label: Sprouts Brand exceeded 25% of sales in Q3 2025 (up from ~20% in 2024). Higher margin than branded equivalents.

Small-format: newer stores 21,000-25,000 sq ft (sweet spot: 23,000). Older stores ~30,000 sq ft. Much smaller than conventional grocers.

E-commerce: ~15.5% of sales in Q3 2025, growing ~21% YoY. Partnerships with [[Instacart]], [[DoorDash]], [[Uber]].

5. **Geographic expansion** — Northeast/Midwest greenfield opportunity
6. **Valuation reset** — P/E compressed from peak ~40x to ~14x; PEG 0.70

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Structural margin expansion (gross margin at 10-year highs)
- 1,400-store long-term TAM vs. 464 today — 3x runway
- Clean balance sheet, strong FCF, active buyback
- Valuation reset — P/E below 10-year median, PEG 0.70
- Loyalty program early innings — only 15% penetration
- Self-distribution margin tailwind just beginning

**Bear:**
- Comp deceleration (11.7% → 0-2% guided in Q4) — has the growth engine stalled?
- California concentration risk (33% of stores in one state)
- Shareholder litigation overhang
- Specialty grocery niche — [[Whole Foods]], [[Trader Joe's]], and conventional grocers all competing for health-conscious share
- Execution risk on aggressive unit growth
