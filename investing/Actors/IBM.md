**IBM** — Enterprise tech giant. Watsonx AI platform, hybrid cloud (Red Hat), semiconductor research. Legacy player pivoting to enterprise AI.

---

## Why IBM matters

IBM is the enterprise AI incumbent:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Enterprise AI | Watsonx platform |
| Hybrid cloud | Red Hat, OpenShift |
| Chip research | Still produces cutting-edge research (2nm) |
| Consulting | Implementation services |

---

## Watsonx AI platform

**Enterprise AI suite:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| watsonx.ai | Foundation models, fine-tuning |
| watsonx.data | Data lakehouse |
| watsonx.governance | AI governance, compliance |

**Positioning:** Enterprise AI for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government).

**Differentiation:**
- On-premise deployment (vs cloud-only)
- Governance/compliance focus
- Integration with existing IBM stack
- Consulting services included

## Granite models

**IBM's foundation models:**

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Granite | Enterprise LLM family |
| Granite Code | Code generation |

Open-sourced some models. Targeting enterprise customers who want control.

## Red Hat / Hybrid cloud

**$34B acquisition (2019):**

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| OpenShift | Kubernetes platform |
| RHEL | Enterprise Linux |
| Ansible | Automation |
| Revenue | ~$4B+ annually |

**AI angle:** OpenShift AI for enterprise ML deployment.

## Semiconductor research

**Still produces cutting-edge research:**

| Achievement | Year |
|-------------|------|
| 2nm demo | 2021 |
| 7nm demo | 2015 |
| DRAM invention | 1966 |

**No longer manufacturing:**
- Sold fabs to [[GlobalFoundries]] (2014)
- Now fabless, partners with [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]]
- Research feeds back to foundry partners

---

## Consulting / services

**Large consulting practice:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consulting revenue | ~$20B |
| Employees | ~300,000 |
| AI services | Growing focus |

Consulting is how IBM deploys Watsonx into enterprises.

## Competitive position

| vs | IBM advantage | IBM disadvantage |
|----|---------------|------------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | On-premise, compliance | Cloud scale, Copilot |
| [[Google]] | Enterprise relationships | Model capability |
| [[Amazon]] | Hybrid expertise | Cloud dominance |
| [[OpenAI]] | Governance, consulting | Consumer mindshare |

IBM targeting enterprises that need control/compliance vs pure cloud.

## Historical significance

**Tech pioneer:**
- Invented DRAM (1966)
- Invented RISC architecture
- Invented relational databases
- Deep Blue beat Kasparov (1997)
- Watson won Jeopardy (2011)

Watson Jeopardy was early AI milestone but overhyped commercially.
