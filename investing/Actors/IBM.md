## Why IBM matters

![[ibm-vs-peers.png]]
*IBM +145% since 2018 — underperformed [[Nasdaq|QQQ]] (+260%) but recovering on Watsonx/Red Hat AI pivot.*

*vs [[Nasdaq|QQQ]]*

IBM is the enterprise AI incumbent:

| Role | Details |
|------|---------|
| Enterprise AI | Watsonx platform |
| Hybrid cloud | Red Hat, OpenShift |
| Chip research | Still produces cutting-edge research (2nm) |
| Consulting | Implementation services |

---

## Watsonx AI platform

**Enterprise AI suite:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| watsonx.ai | Foundation models, fine-tuning |
| watsonx.data | [[Data lakehouse]] |
| watsonx.governance | AI governance, compliance |

**Positioning:** Enterprise AI for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government).

**Differentiation:**
- On-premise deployment (vs cloud-only)
- Governance/compliance focus
- Integration with existing IBM stack
- Consulting services included

---

## Granite models

**IBM's foundation models:**

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Granite | Enterprise LLM family |
| Granite Code | Code generation |

Open-sourced some models. Targeting enterprise customers who want control.

## Red Hat / Hybrid cloud

**$34B acquisition (2019):**

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| OpenShift | Kubernetes platform |
| RHEL | Enterprise Linux |
| Ansible | Automation |
| Revenue | ~$4B+ annually |

**AI angle:** OpenShift AI for enterprise ML deployment.

---

## Semiconductor research

**Still produces cutting-edge research:**

| Achievement | Year |
|-------------|------|
| 2nm demo | 2021 |
| 7nm demo | 2015 |
| DRAM invention | 1966 |

**No longer manufacturing:**
- Sold fabs to [[GlobalFoundries]] (2014)
- Now fabless, partners with [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]]
- Research feeds back to foundry partners

---

## Quantum computing

**Superconducting qubit approach:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Approach | Superconducting transmon qubits |
| Qubits (2024) | 1,000+ (Condor chip) |
| Platform | Qiskit (open-source SDK) |
| Cloud access | IBM Quantum Network |

**IBM is one of the leaders in superconducting quantum hardware.** Large enterprise customer base provides commercialization path.

**[[Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park]]:** IBM is a partner at the 128-acre Chicago quantum campus, alongside anchor tenant [[PsiQuantum]] and other tenants [[Diraq]], [[Infleqtion]], [[Pasqal]].

**[[Chicago Quantum Exchange]]:** $100M investment in University of Chicago quantum research.

## Consulting / services

**Large consulting practice:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consulting revenue | ~$20B |
| Employees | ~300,000 |
| AI services | Growing focus |

Consulting is how IBM deploys Watsonx into enterprises.
