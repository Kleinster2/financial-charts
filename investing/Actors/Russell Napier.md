## Key theses & frameworks

### Financial repression (core thesis)
Napier's central argument since ~2020: governments in the developed world have entered an era of [[financial repression]] — a deliberate policy of keeping [[interest rates]] below the rate of [[inflation]] to erode [[debt]]-to-[[GDP]] ratios over time. Key elements:
- Governments will use directed lending, capital controls, and regulatory pressure to keep rates artificially low
- Commercial banks will be "encouraged" (or forced) to buy government [[bonds]] at below-market rates
- This mirrors the 1945-1980 period when [[UK]] and [[US]] governments used similar tools to reduce post-war [[debt]]
- [[Inflation]] will run 4-6% while rates are held at 2-3%, creating negative real returns for savers
- This is bullish for [[real assets]], [[equities]] (eventually), [[gold]], and [[real estate]]; bearish for [[bonds]]

### Capital controls are coming
Napier argues that to enforce [[financial repression]], governments will increasingly impose:
- Restrictions on capital flows to prevent savings from fleeing to higher-yield jurisdictions
- Requirements for pension funds and insurance companies to hold domestic government [[debt]]
- [[Yield curve control]] or equivalents to cap long-term rates
- These measures will be framed as "macroprudential regulation" rather than explicit controls

### Anatomy of bear markets
From *Anatomy of the Bear*, Napier studied the four great [[bear market]] bottoms (1921, 1932, 1949, 1982) to identify common characteristics:
- [[Bear markets]] don't end with capitulation — they end with exhaustion and indifference
- The [[Tobin's Q]] ratio and [[CAPE ratio]] revert to well below mean at true bottoms
- Government intervention often precedes the turn
- The transition from deflation to inflation signals the bottom

### Government as credit allocator
Napier argues the era of free-market credit allocation is ending. Governments are reasserting control over where capital flows — through industrial policy, green mandates, defense spending requirements, and directed lending. This is the biggest structural shift in decades for investors.

## Track record

### Hits
- Financial repression call: This framework has gained wide acceptance as governments globally have run massive [[fiscal deficit|deficits]] while central banks suppressed rates
- Inflation return: Called the return of structurally higher [[inflation]] before it became consensus
- Government credit direction: Industrial policy ([[CHIPS Act]], [[IRA]], defense spending) has accelerated exactly as he described
- Bear market anatomy: His historical framework correctly identified that post-2020 markets wouldn't behave like post-2008

### Misses / debates
- Deflation call (pre-2020): Was bearish/deflationary for much of 2010s; the [[financial repression]] thesis is relatively recent pivot
- Capital controls timing: Explicit capital controls haven't materialized in developed markets (yet), though regulatory nudges have
- Bond bear severity: While directionally right, the path has been non-linear with significant [[bond]] rallies interrupting the trend
- Equity skepticism: His framework implies equities should struggle in early [[financial repression]], but markets have been resilient
