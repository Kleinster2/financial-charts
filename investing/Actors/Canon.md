## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HQ | Tokyo, Japan |
| DUV market share | ~5% |
| NIL market share | Leading |
| EUV position | **None** (abandoned) |
| Ticker | 7751 (Tokyo) |

## Lithography strategy

Canon took different path than [[Nikon]]:

| Approach | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Traditional EUV | Abandoned |
| DUV (i-line, KrF) | Maintained for legacy |
| **Nanoimprint (NIL)** | Major R&D focus |

Betting NIL can compete with EUV at lower cost.

---

## DUV products

Focuses on mature nodes:

| Type | Wavelength | Applications |
|------|------------|--------------|
| i-line | 365nm | Legacy nodes |
| KrF | 248nm | Mature (65nm+) |
| ArF | 193nm | Limited presence |

Less competitive than [[Nikon]] in advanced DUV.

## Nanoimprint lithography (NIL)

**Alternative to EUV using physical stamping instead of light:**

| Spec | FPA-1200NZ2C |
|------|--------------|
| Resolution | 14nm (equivalent to 5nm node) |
| Throughput | 80 wph |
| Cost vs EUV | **43% lower** |
| First shipment | September 2024 |

---

## How NIL works

1. Template (mask) with nano-patterns pressed onto resist
2. UV light cures the resist
3. Template removed, pattern transferred
4. No wavelength limitation — physical imprint

**Advantage:** No expensive EUV light source needed.

---

## NIL roadmap

| Year | Target | Specs |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2024 | Production start | 14nm, 80 wph |
| 2026 | Improved | Higher throughput |
| 2028 | Advanced | 8nm logic, 10nm DRAM, 20nm 3D NAND |

---

## NIL challenges

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Defects** | Template contact creates particles |
| **Yield** | Lower than EUV for same node |
| **Adoption** | No major foundry committed |
| **Throughput** | 80 wph vs 200+ for EUV |

Industry view: "Not ready for prime time" at leading edge.

## Manufacturing expansion

| Facility | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Utsunomiya fab | 67,000 sq meters |
| Operations start | September 2025 |
| Full capacity | 2027 |
| Target output | >300 systems/year |

Major investment despite uncertain adoption.

---

## NIL market

| Year | Market size |
|------|-------------|
| 2024 | $130.6M |
| 2030E | $224.3M |
| CAGR | 9.5% |

Small compared to $15B+ DUV or EUV markets.

---

## Customer status

| Customer | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Texas Institute of Electronics | First system (2024) |
| Major foundries | **None committed** |
| Memory | Potential for 3D NAND |

Lack of TSMC/Samsung/Intel adoption is critical weakness.

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- NIL cost advantage (43% lower than EUV)
- No wavelength physics limitation
- Could disrupt if defects solved
- Japanese government support

**Bear:**
- Defect problem unsolved
- No major customer adoption
- ASML EUV ecosystem entrenched
- Throughput gap
- Technology unproven at scale
