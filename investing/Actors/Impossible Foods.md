In Sep 2024, acquired Motif FoodWorks' HEMAMI protein (animal-free bovine myoglobin) through patent dispute settlement, strengthening IP position.

## IPO status

Repeatedly delayed. Originally explored in 2022 at ~$10B valuation.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| IPO likelihood | Low near-term |
| Blocker | [[Beyond Meat]] at $2/share ($160M market cap) -- cautionary tale |
| CEO stance | "We could end up selling the company" (mid-2024) |
| Profitability | Not yet profitable |

Analysts say Impossible needs a near-perfect market environment to go public without severe valuation loss.

## Industry headwinds

Plant-based protein sector in decline since 2022 peak:
- Funding has collapsed sector-wide
- Consumer interest plateaued after initial hype
- [[Beyond Meat]] (BYND) stock down ~99% from 2019 IPO peak
- Grocery store shelf space contracting

---

## Restructuring

Late 2022 / early 2023: 6-20% workforce layoffs. Management described as strategic repositioning, not demand-driven. Company claims strong balance sheet and 65-70% growth rates as of early 2023.

## Investment case

Bull:
- Heme technology genuinely differentiates from competitors
- EFSA approval opens EU market
- Rebrand targeting flexitarians (larger TAM than vegans)
- Motif FoodWorks IP acquisition strengthens moat
- If sold, acquirer could be [[Nestle]], [[Unilever]], or food major

Bear:
- Not profitable after 13 years
- No new funding since 2021 -- capital constrained
- IPO window may be permanently closed for this cycle
- [[Beyond Meat]] collapse destroyed sector comps
- CEO openly discussing sale -- signals limited standalone optionality
- Plant-based consumer demand plateauing
