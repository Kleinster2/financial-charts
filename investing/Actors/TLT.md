## What It Tracks

US Treasury bonds with 20+ years to maturity. Pure interest rate bet — no credit risk, just duration. Moves ~16% for every 1% move in long-term yields (inverse).

## Use Case

The vault's primary rates instrument. TLT appears in two dashboard charts:
- **US yield curve** — [[BIL]] vs [[SHY]] vs [[IEI]] vs [[IEF]] vs TLT (short to long duration)
- **Global bonds** — TLT vs Japanese, UK, EU, Australian, Chinese government bonds

TLT falling = long rates rising = tighter financial conditions.

## Related

- [[IEF]] — 7-10 year Treasury (medium duration)
- [[SHY]] — 1-3 year Treasury (short duration)
- [[BIL]] — T-bills (cash proxy)
- [[Federal Reserve]] — primary driver
- [[BlackRock]] — issuer
