## Why Schroders matters

A 222-year-old City of London institution — one of the last major independent European asset managers — is being swallowed by a U.S. buyer. The deal is the **largest-ever acquisition of a European fund manager**.

**Geographic exposure:** ~2/3 of AUM in EMEA, providing the global footprint Nuveen lacked.

## Nuveen acquisition (Feb 12, 2026)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquirer | [[Nuveen]] (subsidiary of [[TIAA]]) |
| Price | 612p/share (590p cash + 22p dividends) |
| Premium | 34% to prior close |
| Deal value | £9.9B ($13.5B) |
| Valuation | 16.5x 2026 earnings |
| Combined AUM | ~$2.5T |
| Combined private markets | $414B |
| Stock reaction | +29% on announcement |

**Key terms:**
- All-cash deal, board-recommended
- Schroders brand maintained, HQ stays London
- CEO Oldfield continues post-close
- Schroder family selling entire 44% stake — ending 222 years of family control
- Only 41% irrevocable backing so far — Morningstar analyst sees room for holdouts to push higher

**Strategic rationale:**
- Nuveen gets global (especially EMEA) footprint — was 94% Americas
- Schroders gets scale to compete vs [[BlackRock]], Vanguard, [[State Street]]
- Combined private markets platform ($414B) competes with top alternatives managers

**Advisers:** BNP Paribas (Nuveen), Wells Fargo + Barclays (Schroders)

**Deal risk discount (day 1):** Stock trading ~588p vs 612p offer — ~4% spread.
- Only 41% irrevocable commitments — significant room for holdouts
- Morningstar (Johann Scholtz): "Despite board support, only 41% of shareholders have given irrevocable backing, suggesting significant room for holdouts to push for a higher price. With the fundamentals improving and shareholder alignment far from locked, this story is unlikely to end at the current terms"
- Possible competing bid? Unlikely given TIAA's deep pockets, but improving fundamentals + cheap UK valuations could attract interest
- Market fairly confident on completion but pricing in time value + regulatory approval risk

New management team in just 15 months:
- Cut costs, shed tangential businesses
- Re-established UK equity market links
- 2025 operating profit beat guidance (£756.6M vs £745M target)
- AUM up 6% in 2025
- Panmure Liberum: "To have achieved quite so much, quite so quickly is staggering"

## History

- **1804:** Founded by Johann Heinrich Schröder, financing transatlantic trade
- Grew into one of London's premier merchant banks
- Evolved into pure asset management
- Schroder family maintained control through dual share classes
- Stock down 30% over 5 years pre-deal despite turnaround

## Sector implications

Mid-sized European active managers are under pressure from:
1. **Passive giants** (BlackRock, Vanguard) eating market share
2. **Scale economics** favoring consolidation
3. **UK stock discount** making British firms cheap targets

Recent deals: BNP Paribas bought AXA's fund arm (2025). [[Aberdeen]] seen as next potential target.

RBC: "The deal acts as a statement in the value of traditional asset management."
