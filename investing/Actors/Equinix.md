**Equinix** — Largest data center REIT. Interconnection-focused. Global footprint.

---

## Why Equinix matters

Equinix is the largest publicly traded data center company:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~$80B+ |
| Data centers | 260+ facilities |
| Markets | 70+ metros, 30+ countries |
| Model | Colocation + interconnection |

---

## Business model

**Colocation:**
- Customers rent space, power, cooling
- Bring their own servers
- Multi-tenant facilities
- Enterprise and cloud customers

**Interconnection (key differentiator):**
- Customers connect to each other inside Equinix
- Cloud on-ramps (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Network density creates moat
- Higher margin than pure colo

---

## Interconnection moat

**Why interconnection matters:**
- Once inside Equinix, customers connect to partners
- Network effects — more customers = more valuable
- Switching costs increase over time
- Premium pricing for connectivity

**Revenue mix:**
- ~20% from interconnection
- Higher margin than colocation
- Recurring, sticky revenue

---

## AI exposure

**Mixed picture:**
- Traditional colo less suited for AI (power density)
- Building xScale (hyperscale JV) for AI workloads
- Interconnection valuable for AI inference
- Not primary AI infrastructure play

**xScale JV:**
- Partnership with GIC (Singapore sovereign wealth)
- Hyperscale-focused facilities
- Better suited for AI workloads
