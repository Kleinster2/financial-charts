## Why it matters

The FCC controls spectrum allocation and satellite constellation licensing, making it a key gatekeeper for [[Starlink]], [[Amazon]] Leo, [[AST SpaceMobile]], and other LEO broadband players. Approval timelines and deployment deadlines directly impact satellite company valuations.
