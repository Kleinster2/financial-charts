## NSA codebreaking (1964-1968)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Employer | Institute for [[Defense]] Analyses (IDA), Princeton |
| Client | National Security Agency (NSA) |
| Work | Codebreaking, classified cryptanalysis |
| Key contact | Met Leonard Baum (Baum-Welch algorithm creator) |

### Departure

- Simons grew opposed to Vietnam War
- Wrote letter to New York Times criticizing war (1967)
- Told Newsweek he would stop defense work until war ended
- Fired from IDA in mid-1968 as direct result

**Legacy**: Codebreaking skills and pattern recognition later applied to financial markets.

## Mathematics career

### Chern-Simons theory (1974)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Collaborator | Shiing-Shen Chern (renowned geometer) |
| Paper | "Characteristic Forms and Geometric Invariants" (1974) |
| Discovery | Chern-Simons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds |
| Later impact | Edward Witten showed importance in quantum field theory and string theory |

**Simons quote**: "So today, that is called Chern-Simons theory. It's all over the place in physics. On average, every day, four papers in physics reference this Chern-Simons theory."

Simons called collaboration with Chern "the high spot of my mathematical life."

### Academic honors

| [[Honor]] | Year |
|-------|------|
| AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry | 1976 |
| Chair, Stony Brook Math Department | 1968-1978 |

### Stony Brook tenure

- Built department into world-class program
- Recruited top mathematicians
- Created foundation for later quant hiring approach

## Renaissance Technologies

### Founding philosophy

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Hire scientists | Mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists — not MBAs |
| Pattern recognition | Apply codebreaking mindset to markets |
| Systematic | Pure quant; no fundamental analysis |
| Secrecy | Methods never disclosed; extreme NDAs |

### Medallion Fund

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launched | 1988 |
| Named after | Math awards Simons and James Ax had won |
| Access | Employees only (closed to outsiders) |
| AUM | ~$15B (capped) |
| Gross annual return | ~66% average |
| Net annual return | ~39% average (after 5/44 fees) |
| Fee structure | 5% management + 44% performance |
| Total profits (1988-2024) | >$100B |
| Losing years | 1 (1989, minor) |

**$1 invested in 1988** in Medallion would be worth >$40,000 by 2023 (vs ~$40 in S&P 500).

## Legacy

| Achievement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Best track record | Outperformed Buffett, Soros, everyone |
| Proved quant works | Systematic trading can beat markets long-term |
| Inspired industry | [[Two Sigma]], D.E. Shaw, countless others |
| Talent pipeline | Defined quant hiring: PhDs, not MBAs |
| Math contribution | Chern-Simons theory foundational in physics |

**Called**: "The most successful hedge fund manager of all time" ([[Wall Street consensus]])

## Investment relevance

**Why track Jim Simons**:

1. **[[Benchmark]]** — Medallion is the gold standard. All quants compared to it.

2. **Post-Simons era** — Died May 2024. Watch Renaissance for any performance/culture changes.

3. **Mercer influence** — Despite resignation, Mercer's political activity and wealth from Renaissance remains significant.

4. **Tax/regulatory risk** — $7B IRS settlement shows aggressive tax strategies can backfire.

5. **Hiring template** — Renaissance approach (scientists, not MBAs) now industry standard.
