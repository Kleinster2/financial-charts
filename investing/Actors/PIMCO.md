## Thesis rationale

**Fundamental shift:**

| Old assumption | New reality |
|----------------|-------------|
| DM = fiscal discipline | Fiscal concerns rising in US/[[Europe]] |
| EM = fiscal risk | Select EM showing discipline |
| EM = CB independence risk | US facing CB independence questions |

**Dhawan:** "Some of the best balance sheets are in select high-quality emerging markets. I can see a world where some EM yields trade inside DM."

**Key factors:**
- EM central banks have built credibility
- Real yields attractive
- Scope for currency appreciation
- Not blanket dollar bet — selective fiscal discipline
