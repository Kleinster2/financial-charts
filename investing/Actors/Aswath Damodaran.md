## Key frameworks

### DCF valuation
Foundational advocate of [[discounted cash flow]] analysis. Value = present value of expected future cash flows, adjusted for risk. Publishes spreadsheets and walkthroughs for every valuation he does.

### Narrative + Numbers
Framework from his 2017 book: every valuation is a story (narrative) converted into numbers. The narrative must be possible, plausible, and probable. Numbers without narrative are mechanical; narrative without numbers is fantasy.

### Corporate lifecycle
His 2024 book *The Corporate Life Cycle* frames companies through birth-growth-maturity-decline stages. Different valuation tools apply at each stage. Young companies need story-driven approaches; mature companies need cash-flow focus.

### Equity risk premium
Maintains and publishes monthly updates on the implied [[equity risk premium]] for the [[S&P 500]]. One of the most widely cited datasets in finance. Uses a forward-looking, market-implied approach rather than historical averages.

## Notable public valuations

- [[Tesla]] — Published bear-case valuations repeatedly, argued market was pricing in implausible scenarios. Eventually acknowledged he underestimated the "story" premium
- [[Uber]] — Valued at IPO, argued market overpriced it. Proved largely correct in early years
- [[Apple]] — Regular valuations showing it as fairly to slightly overvalued. Consistently argued against the "Apple is cheap" narrative
- [[Nvidia]] — Published valuations during AI boom, warning about pricing in perfection
- [[Twitter]] — Valued during [[Elon Musk]] acquisition saga, argued $44B was overpaying

## Track record

### Hits ✅
- Uber IPO skepticism — Correctly argued [[Uber]] was overvalued at IPO; stock fell significantly in first years
- Twitter/Musk overpay — Said $44B was too much for [[Twitter]]; subsequent write-downs confirmed this
- Valuation education — His free courses and datasets have educated millions and democratized corporate valuation
- ERP dataset — Industry standard for equity risk premium estimation

### Misses ❌
- Tesla persistent undervaluation — Repeatedly valued [[Tesla]] well below market price; would have missed the entire 2020–21 run
- Growth stock skepticism — Systematic bias toward "numbers over narrative" means he often undervalues high-growth companies in early stages
- Timing — As he freely admits, being "right on value" doesn't help if the market takes years to converge
- Not a portfolio manager — Academic valuations without position sizing, risk management, or timing
