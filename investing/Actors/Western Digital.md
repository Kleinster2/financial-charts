## Why Western Digital matters

Dual exposure to storage trends:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | WDC |
| Market cap | ~$25B+ |
| Business | HDD only (post-Feb 2025 spin-off) |
| Customers | Hyperscalers, enterprise, consumer |
| Competitor | [[Seagate]] (HDD) |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Products | Trend |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Nearline HDD** | High-capacity data center drives | AI storage demand surge |
| **Enterprise HDD** | Mission-critical storage | Stable |
| **Consumer HDD** | Desktop, portable drives | Declining |

Post-separation, WDC is a pure HDD company. Flash business now operates as [[SanDisk]].

---

## Flash business spin-off (completed)

**[[SanDisk]] separation (Feb 21, 2025):**
- WDC completed spin-off of flash business into [[SanDisk]] Corporation
- WDC retained HDD business; SanDisk took NAND flash and SSDs
- WDC has **fully exited the SSD market**
- Both companies trade independently

**Result:** Pure-play HDD company, unlocking value and strategic clarity.

---

## Kioxia relationship (historical)

**Pre-separation:** WDC had joint NAND manufacturing with [[Kioxia]] in [[Japan]].

**Post-separation (Feb 2025):** The Kioxia JV relationship transferred to [[SanDisk]]. WDC no longer involved in NAND.

See [[Kioxia]] and [[SanDisk]] for current JV details.

## AI storage angle

Post-separation, WDC is a **pure-play HDD** company like [[Seagate]]:

| Storage tier | WDC role |
|--------------|----------|
| Cold/Archive | **Nearline HDDs** — bulk storage |
| Training data | **High-capacity drives** — petabytes |

AI data centers need massive cold storage for training data, checkpoints, and archives. HDD remains cost-effective for capacity-tier storage.

**Post-separation**: WDC and [[Seagate]] are pure HDD peers; [[SanDisk]] competes in flash.

## Hyperscaler customers

| Customer | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Azure storage tiers |
| [[Amazon]] | S3, EBS backend |
| [[Google]] | Cloud storage |
| [[Meta]] | Data infrastructure |

---

## Competitive position

| Factor | Western Digital | [[Seagate]] |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| HDD | Strong \#2 | \#1 nearline |
| Technology | ePMR, MAMR | HAMR (leading) |
| Focus | Pure HDD (post-spin) | Pure HDD |
| Structure | Simpler (post-spin) | Simple |

Post-separation, WDC and Seagate are direct HDD peers. Seagate leads on HAMR technology; WDC competing on ePMR/MAMR.

## Q2 FY2026 earnings (Jan 29, 2026)

| Metric | Result | vs Est |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $3.02B | beat |
| YoY growth | +25% | — |
| EPS | $2.13 | beat $1.91 |

Cloud and AI data center storage demand driving results. Stock up **~11% on Jan 28** after [[Seagate]]'s blowout quarter.

**Analyst upgrades:**
- [[Citi]]: PT raised to **$280** from $200 (Buy)
- [[Mizuho]]: PT raised to **$240** from $180 (Outperform)

Thesis: Storage industry facing genuine supply crunch with pricing power.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI data storage demand (nearline HDDs)
- Supply crunch creating pricing power
- Spin-off complete — pure-play clarity
- [[Hyperscaler capex]] tailwind

**Bear:**
- [[Seagate]] HAMR technology leadership
- [[Consumer]] storage declining
- HDD long-term share loss to SSD
- Single-product company risk
