**Western Digital** — HDD + NAND. Spun off flash business ([[SanDisk]]). Nearline HDDs for data centers.

---

## Why Western Digital matters

Dual exposure to storage trends:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | WDC |
| Market cap | ~$15-20B |
| Business | HDD + NAND flash |
| Customers | Hyperscalers, enterprise, consumer |
| Competitor | [[Seagate]] (HDD), [[Micron]]/Kioxia (NAND) |

---

## Business segments

| Segment | Products | Trend |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **HDD** | Nearline, enterprise, consumer | Nearline growing |
| **Flash** | SSDs, embedded, consumer | Cyclical recovery |

---

## Flash business spin-off

**[[SanDisk]] / Flash spin-off (2024):**
- WD split into HDD and Flash companies
- Flash = [[SanDisk]] brand
- Kioxia JV complicates structure
- Aimed to unlock value

**Post-split**: Allows pure-play positioning for each business.

---

## Kioxia relationship

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| JV fabs | Joint NAND manufacturing in [[Japan]] |
| Ownership | Minority stake in Kioxia |
| Complexity | Shared capex, separate products |
| Risk | Coordination challenges |

See [[Kioxia]] for NAND JV details.

## AI storage angle

Same as Seagate — AI data needs storage:

| Layer | WDC product |
|-------|-------------|
| Hot (fast) | Enterprise SSDs |
| Warm | Capacity SSDs |
| Cold | Nearline HDDs |

**Advantage over Seagate**: WDC plays both SSD and HDD.

## Hyperscaler customers

| Customer | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Azure storage tiers |
| [[Amazon]] | S3, EBS backend |
| [[Google]] | Cloud storage |
| [[Meta]] | Data infrastructure |

---

## Competitive position

| Factor | Western Digital | [[Seagate]] |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| HDD | Strong #2 | #1 nearline |
| NAND | Yes (Kioxia JV) | No |
| Technology | ePMR, MAMR | HAMR |
| Complexity | Higher (two businesses) | Simpler |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- AI data storage demand
- NAND cycle recovery
- Spin-off unlocks value
- Dual HDD/SSD exposure
- [[Hyperscaler capex]] tailwind

**Bear:**
- Kioxia JV complexity
- NAND commoditized
- Seagate HAMR leadership in HDD
- [[Consumer]] storage declining
- Execution risk on spin-off
