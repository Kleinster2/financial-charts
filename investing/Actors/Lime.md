# Lime

World's largest shared electric vehicle company. E-scooters and e-bikes rented by the minute in 280+ cities across ~30 countries. Founded 2017. The only micromobility operator to achieve sustained profitability — first profitable year in 2022, free cash flow positive since 2023. IPO expected 2026 with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as lead underwriters.

## What makes Lime, Lime

**The survivor.** While Bird went bankrupt (Dec 2023), Tier merged out of necessity, and dozens of startups folded, Lime cracked the unit economics that killed everyone else:

1. **Vehicle lifespan** — Early shared scooters lasted <6 months. Lime's Gen4 fleet lasts 2+ years through better hardware and modular repair design
2. **Utilization** — Software-driven rebalancing + dynamic pricing maximizes rides per vehicle per day
3. **City relationships** — Long-term permits in 280+ cities create a regulatory moat; new entrants face 1-2 year permitting cycles
4. **Uber integration** — Uber owns a significant stake and surfaces Lime in its app, providing demand without CAC
5. **Density economics** — More vehicles per city → lower per-unit ops cost → higher margins → can afford more vehicles

**Why others failed:** Bird prioritized growth over unit economics, burned through $800M+, went public via SPAC at peak hype, never achieved positive EBITDA. Lime was slower to expand but focused on per-ride profitability.

## IPO setup

**Timing:** Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan hired Jun 2025. Expected to list 2026.

**Valuation math:**
- Last private mark: $510M (2020, distressed Uber deal) → likely irrelevant
- Tracxn current estimate: $1.7B
- At 10x 2024 EBITDA ($140M): ~$1.4B
- At 15x EBITDA (growth premium for 30%+ topline): ~$2.1B
- At 3x revenue ($686M): ~$2.1B

**Bull case for IPO:** Only profitable micromobility company globally. 30%+ revenue growth with expanding margins. Proven operating model in 280 cities. Rides growing 30% YoY. Goldman's Ben Frost calls 2026 a "pivotal year" for IPOs — best pipeline since 2021.

**Bear case:** E-bike maintenance costs remain high (battery replacements). Regulatory risk (Paris banned shared scooters via referendum, 2023). Seasonal demand drops 50%+ in winter markets. Still private — limited financial transparency.

## Competitive landscape (2025)

| Operator | Status | Geography |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Lime** | Profitable, IPO-bound | Global (280 cities, 30 countries) |
| **Tier/Dott** | Merged 2022 | Europe |
| **Voi** | Private, Nordic-focused | Northern Europe |
| **Bolt** | Super-app (rideshare + scooters) | Europe, Africa |
| **Bird** | **Bankrupt** (Dec 2023) | — |
| **Spin** | Shut down (2023) | — |
| [[Lyft]] | Bikes/scooters segment | US cities |

**Moat:** Regulatory permits + Uber integration + fleet density. New entrants face multi-year permitting in most major cities.

## Key risks

| Risk | Severity | Detail |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Regulatory bans** | High | Paris referendum banned scooters 2023; could spread |
| **E-bike maintenance** | Medium | Battery replacements + vandalism = high variable cost |
| **Seasonality** | Medium | Northern markets lose 50%+ ridership in winter |
| **Uber dependency** | Medium | Uber is both investor and demand channel — misaligned incentives possible |
| **IPO market** | Low-Medium | If 2026 IPO window closes, stuck private at unclear valuation |
