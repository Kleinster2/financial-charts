**Google (Alphabet)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler, TPU pioneer, [[Broadcom]] disintermediation in progress.

---

## Relevance to semis

Google is both a major TSMC customer (via Broadcom TPUs) and potentially a threat to Broadcom's ASIC margins.

---

## TPU strategy

### Current: Broadcom partnership
- TPUs designed by [[Broadcom]], fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Broadcom takes ~55% gross margin (~$15B/yr "tax")

### TPUv8 dual path
- **Sunfish**: Broadcom turnkey (status quo)
- **Zebrafish**: Google sources directly, [[MediaTek]] for supporting chips

Google attempting to escape Broadcom's margin capture. Must cut ASIC costs to compete with [[NVIDIA]] Blackwell unit economics in 2026.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI capex | $50B+ annually |
| TPU generations | v1 through v7 (current) |
| Foundry | [[TSMC]] (via Broadcom) |

---

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: TPUs = TSMC capacity, regardless of Broadcom relationship
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Top 3 spender on AI infrastructure
