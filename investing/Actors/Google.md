**Google (Alphabet)** — Tier 1 AI hyperscaler. DeepMind/Gemini, TPU pioneer, Anthropic investor, [[Broadcom]] disintermediation in progress.

---

## Why Google matters

Google is the most vertically integrated AI hyperscaler:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI capex | $50B+ annually |
| AI lab | DeepMind (Gemini) |
| Custom silicon | TPU (7 generations) |
| Cloud | GCP (#3 behind AWS, Azure) |
| AI investment | [[Anthropic]] ($2B+) |

---

## DeepMind / Gemini

**Google's AI research arm:**
- Merged Google Brain + DeepMind (2023)
- Led by [[Demis Hassabis]]
- Gemini model family (competing with GPT-4, Claude)

| Model | Tier | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Gemini Ultra | Flagship | Multimodal |
| Gemini Pro | Mid-tier | API access |
| Gemini Nano | On-device | Mobile/edge |
| Gemini 2.0 | Latest | Agentic capabilities |

**Competitive position:** Roughly par with OpenAI, catching up on consumer mindshare.

## TPU strategy

**Custom AI silicon (7 generations):**

| Generation | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| TPU v1-v4 | Deployed | Internal + Cloud |
| TPU v5 | Current | Widely available |
| TPU v6 (Trillium) | Ramping | Latest generation |
| TPU v7 | Development | Next-gen |
| TPU v9 | Planned (2027) | Exploring Intel EMIB |

### CoWoS bottleneck (Jan 2026)

**TPU production cut due to TSMC constraints:**

| Metric | Original | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 2026 TPU target | ~4M units | ~3M units |
| Cause | TSMC CoWoS shortage | — |
| Problem | NVIDIA locked >50% of CoWoS through 2027 | — |

**Google's response:**
- Exploring Intel EMIB packaging for TPU v9 (2027)
- Also sounding out Samsung facilities in Texas
- Forced to cut production despite strong internal demand

**The allocation problem:** TSMC's packaging capacity now determines who scales AI — Google is constrained by NVIDIA's priority access.

### Broadcom relationship

**Current: Broadcom partnership**
- TPUs designed by [[Broadcom]], fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Broadcom takes ~55% gross margin (~$15B/yr "tax")

### TPUv8 dual path (disintermediation)

| Path | Partner | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Sunfish** | Broadcom | Turnkey (status quo) |
| **Zebrafish** | Direct + [[MediaTek]] | Google sources directly |

Google attempting to escape Broadcom's margin capture. Must cut ASIC costs to compete with [[NVIDIA]] Blackwell unit economics in 2026.

See [[Hyperscaler disintermediation]] for broader trend.

## Anthropic investment

**Hedging AI lab risk:**

| Investment | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Anthropic stake | $2B+ | Minority investor |
| Cloud deal | $3B+ | GCP credits |

Google backs Anthropic while competing with Claude via Gemini — hedging like Microsoft backing both OpenAI and Mistral.

**Anthropic TPU deal:** ~1M TPUv7 direct from [[Broadcom]], not through Google Cloud. See [[Anthropic]].

---

## Google Cloud (GCP)

**#3 cloud provider:**

| Provider | Market share |
|----------|--------------|
| AWS | ~32% |
| Azure | ~23% |
| **GCP** | ~11% |

**AI differentiation:**
- TPU access (vs NVIDIA-only competitors)
- Vertex AI platform
- Gemini API
- BigQuery ML

---

## Power strategy

**Nuclear for AI:**
- [[Kairos Power]] SMR deal — 500MW
- Long-term carbon-free baseload
- Part of [[BYOP]] trend

**Data centers:** Expanding globally, power constraints apply. See [[Power constraints]].

---

## Infrastructure investments

| Project | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Kairos Power | 500MW SMR development |
| Submarine cables | Multiple investments ([[Google Pacific Connect]]) |
| Data centers | Global expansion |

---

## Other Bets

**Alphabet structure separates:**

| Bet | Status |
|-----|--------|
| [[Waymo]] | Leader in autonomous driving |
| Verily | Life sciences |
| Wing | Drone delivery |
| Calico | Longevity research |

Waymo is most relevant — potential robotaxi monetization.

## Competitive position

| vs | Google advantage | Google disadvantage |
|----|------------------|---------------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Custom silicon (TPU) | Cloud market share |
| [[Amazon]] | AI research depth | Cloud dominance |
| [[Meta]] | Cloud business | Open-source momentum |
| [[OpenAI]] | Distribution (Search, Android) | Consumer mindshare |

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI capex | $50B+ annually |
| TPU generations | v1 through v7 |
| Cloud rank | #3 (GCP) |
| AI lab | DeepMind |
| Key model | Gemini |
| Foundry | [[TSMC]] (via Broadcom) |
| Anthropic stake | $2B+ |

## For theses

**[[Long TSMC]]**: TPUs = TSMC capacity, regardless of Broadcom relationship
**[[Long Broadcom]]**: $15B/yr TPU revenue at risk from disintermediation
**[[AI hyperscalers]]**: Top 3 spender on AI infrastructure
**[[Nuclear power for AI]]**: Kairos Power deal validates nuclear for AI
