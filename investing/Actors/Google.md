## DeepMind / Gemini

**Google's AI research arm:**
- Merged Google Brain + DeepMind (2023)
- Led by [[Demis Hassabis]]
- Gemini model family (competing with GPT-4, [[Claude]])

| Model | Tier | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Gemini 3** | Latest | Released Q1 2026, outperforms competitors on benchmarks |
| Gemini 2.0 | Previous gen | Agentic capabilities |
| Gemini Ultra | Flagship | Multimodal |
| Gemini Pro | Mid-tier | API access |
| Gemini Nano | On-device | Mobile/edge |

**Scale:** 750M MAU (up from 650M in Q3 2025). Serving unit costs down 78% over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements.

**Apple deal:** Multiyear agreement for [[Apple]] to use Gemini in revamped [[Siri]]. Initial features iOS 26.5 (**May/June 2026**), full chatbot revamp iOS 27 (**September 2026**) — delayed from original March target after testing snags (Feb 12 Gurman). Reaches Apple's 2.5B active devices — major distribution win. Gurman: Gemini collaboration is the reason Apple can still ship this year. See [[Apple-Google AI deal]].

**Competitive position:** Roughly par with OpenAI, gaining on consumer mindshare. Gemini 3 benchmarks ahead of competitors.

## TPU strategy

**Custom AI silicon (7 generations):**

| Generation | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| TPU v1-v4 | Deployed | Internal + Cloud |
| TPU v5 | Current | Widely available |
| TPU v6 (Trillium) | Ramping | Latest generation |
| TPU v7 (Ironwood) | Shipping (Nov 2025) | Closes gap with NVIDIA |
| TPU v9 | Planned (2027) | Exploring [[Intel]] EMIB |

### TPU vs NVIDIA performance (BF16 Dense TFLOPs)

![[tpu-vs-nvidia-tflops.png]]
*[[NVIDIA]]. Source: [[SemiAnalysis]] — [TPUv7: Google Takes a Swing at the King](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the)*

| Chip | Release | TFLOPs | Gap to NVIDIA |
|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| TPU v4 | Jun 2022 | ~275 | 3.6x behind H100 |
| TPU v5e | Jun 2023 | ~197 | Efficiency variant |
| TPU v5p | Dec 2023 | ~459 | 2.2x behind H100 |
| TPU v6 | Jun 2024 | ~918 | Still behind H100 |
| **TPU v7** | Dec 2025 | **~2,340** | **94% of GB200** |

**Key insight:** TPU v7 nearly closes the gap — first time Google has reached parity with NVIDIA's flagship. Previous generations were 2-3x behind.

### CoWoS bottleneck (Jan 2026)

**TPU production cut due to TSMC constraints:**

| Metric | Original | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 2026 TPU target | ~4M units | ~[[3M]] units |
| Cause | TSMC CoWoS shortage | — |
| Problem | NVIDIA locked >50% of CoWoS through 2027 | — |

**Google's response:**
- Exploring [[Intel]] EMIB packaging for TPU v9 (2027)
- Also sounding out [[Samsung]] facilities in Texas
- Forced to cut production despite strong internal demand

**The allocation problem:** TSMC's packaging capacity now determines who scales AI — Google is constrained by NVIDIA's priority access.

### Broadcom relationship

**Current: Broadcom partnership**
- TPUs designed by [[Broadcom]], fabbed at [[TSMC]]
- Broadcom takes ~55% gross margin (~$15B/yr "tax")

### TPUv8 dual path (disintermediation)

| Path | Partner | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Sunfish** | Broadcom | Turnkey (status quo) |
| **Zebrafish** | Direct + [[MediaTek]] | Google sources directly |

Google attempting to escape Broadcom's margin capture. Must cut ASIC costs to compete with [[NVIDIA]] Blackwell unit economics in 2026.

See [[Hyperscaler disintermediation]] for broader trend.

---

## Anthropic investment

**Hedging AI lab risk:**

| Investment | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Anthropic stake | $2B+ | Minority investor |
| Cloud deal | $3B+ | GCP credits |

Google backs Anthropic while competing with [[Claude]] via Gemini — hedging like Microsoft backing both OpenAI and [[Mistral]].

**Anthropic TPU deal:** ~1M TPUv7 direct from [[Broadcom]], not through Google Cloud. See [[Anthropic]].

---

## Google Cloud (GCP)

**\#3 cloud provider:**

| Provider | Market share |
|----------|--------------|
| AWS | ~32% |
| Azure | ~23% |
| **GCP** | ~11% |

**Q4 2025:** $17.66B revenue (+48% YoY). Backlog surged to $240B — up 55% sequentially and 2x YoY.

**AI differentiation:**
- TPU access (vs NVIDIA-only competitors)
- [[Vertex]] AI platform
- Gemini API
- BigQuery ML

---

## Power strategy

**The grid bottleneck (Jan 2026):**

Marsden Hanna (Global Head of Sustainability and Climate Policy): Grid connection wait times exceed **12 years** in some US areas — a major obstacle to data center expansion.

Amanda Peterson Corio (Global Head of DC Energy): "We're looking at siting next to power generation and creating these industrial parks — still connected to the grid at the substation or interconnection point, but removing the bottlenecks to bringing generation online and also loads online."

**Response: Vertical integration into power**

| Deal | Value | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| [[Intersect Power]] acquisition | **$4.75B** (Dec 2025) | Co-located solar + storage + DC |
| [[Kairos Power]] SMR | 500MW | Nuclear baseload |
| [[TPG]] Rise Climate partnership | $20B target | Clean energy parks |

**Colocation model:**
- Data centers sited next to power plants
- Industrial parks with integrated generation + compute
- Connected at substation level — bypasses 12-year interconnection queue
- First co-located project: operational 2026, fully complete 2027

**Data centers:** Expanding globally, power constraints apply. See [[Power constraints]].

---

## Infrastructure investments

| Project | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Kairos Power | 500MW SMR development |
| Submarine cables | Multiple investments ([[Google Pacific Connect]]) |
| Data centers | Global expansion |

## Other Bets

**Alphabet structure separates:**

| Bet | Status | Valuation |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| [[Waymo]] | Leader in autonomous driving | $126B (Feb 2026), 6 cities |
| Verily | Life sciences | — |
| [[Wing]] | Drone delivery | — |
| Calico | Longevity research | — |

**Waymo** is the crown jewel — $16B raised Feb 2026 at $126B valuation (~6% of Alphabet market cap). Only 1/6th of [[OpenAI]]'s valuation despite commercial robotaxi operations in 6 cities. Alphabet owns >75% post-round.

20M+ fully autonomous trips completed. 400K+ weekly rides. Launched Miami (6th city) in Jan 2026. Took $2.1B stock-based compensation charge in Q4 2025 tied to funding round.

## Competitive position

| vs | Google advantage | Google disadvantage |
|----|------------------|---------------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Custom silicon (TPU) | Cloud market share |
| [[Amazon]] | AI research depth | Cloud dominance |
| [[Meta]] | Cloud business | Open-source momentum |
| [[OpenAI]] | Distribution (Search, Android) | [[Consumer]] mindshare |

## Google TV (smart TV platform)

**Google's smart TV operating system** — successor to Android TV (2014), rebranded as Google TV in 2020 when it unified Chromecast and Android TV under a new content-discovery-focused UI. Now powering smart TVs, streaming devices, set-top boxes, and portable projectors.

### History

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2014 | Android TV launched (replacing failed Google TV 1.0 from 2010) |
| 2020 | Rebranded to Google TV with Chromecast unification |
| 2023 | 150M monthly active devices |
| 2024 | 270M monthly active devices announced |
| 2025 | Likely surpassed 300M devices. Budget cuts + layoffs (~25% of 300-person team) |

### Market position

| Platform | Global smart TV OS share | US position |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Android TV / Google TV | ~35% (global leader) | \#3-4 behind [[Roku]], [[Samsung]] Tizen |
| [[Samsung]] Tizen | ~20% | \#2 |
| [[LG]] webOS | ~25% | Strong |
| [[Roku]] | ~10% globally | **\#1 in US** (90M+ streaming households) |
| [[Amazon]] Fire TV | — | \#2-3 in US |

**Global vs US disconnect:** Google TV leads globally (40% ex-North America, ex-China per research firms) but trails in the lucrative US market where ad monetization is highest. Many global devices are pay-TV operator set-top boxes with minimal monetization for Google.

### OEM partnerships

| Partner | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Sony]] | Long-standing, flagship Google TV partner |
| [[TCL]] | Shifted from [[Roku]] to Google TV (CES 2024-2025) |
| [[Hisense]] | Shifted from [[Roku]] to Google TV, but [[Amazon]] poached Costco shelf space |
| [[Chromecast]] | Google's own hardware (now Google TV Streamer) |
| Various projector OEMs | Google TV built into portable projectors |

### Revenue model & monetization problem

Google TV follows the **platform subsidy model** — invest in scale first, monetize later. But monetization has lagged:

- **Ad inventory sharing:** Google required publishers to share ad inventory to be on the platform. In 2024, reversed course and gave inventory back — tacit admission publishers sell ads better than Google does
- **Now taking revenue cuts** instead of inventory — lower-margin arrangement
- **Retail bounties:** Google pays TV makers and retailers per activated device. [[Amazon]] outspends Google (~$50/activated TV), poaching partners like [[Hisense]] from Google TV at [[Costco]]
- **Not yet break-even:** Google has spent hundreds of millions annually on Google TV without reaching profitability (per The Verge, Aug 2025)

### YouTube tension

YouTube is Google's real TV winner — 12.5% of all US TV viewing (May 2025, Nielsen), $50B+ in annual ad + subscription revenue. YouTube executives have shown "little interest" in Google TV, with some arguing the budget should be redirected to YouTube. YouTube's dominance means Google no longer needs Google TV as leverage in content negotiations — YouTube can dictate terms to device makers directly.

### Competitive dynamics

| Competitor | Advantage over Google TV | Google TV advantage |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| [[Roku]] | \#1 US market share, better ad monetization | Google TV gaining OEM share globally |
| [[Amazon]] Fire TV | Aggressive bounties, [[Costco]] displacement | Broader global OEM adoption |
| [[Apple]] tvOS | Premium ecosystem, privacy | Scale (300M+ vs Apple's niche) |
| [[Samsung]] Tizen | Captive Samsung TV install base | OEM-agnostic, works across brands |
| [[LG]] webOS | Licensed to other brands now | Larger global footprint |

### Emerging threats

New entrants crowding the market: **TiVo**, **Whale TV**, and [[The Trade Desk]]'s **Ventura** platform all entering TV OS space (2025-2026).

### Strategic outlook

Google TV sits in an awkward position: dominant globally but money-losing, with YouTube rendering it strategically less essential. The 2025 budget cuts and team reduction (25% layoff) signal a shift toward AI-driven efficiency ([[Gemini]] integration for search/discovery) rather than headcount-driven growth. Google is seeking shorter-term bounty agreements with TV makers — suggesting potential further pullback.

**For investors:** Google TV revenue falls within the "Subscriptions, platforms, and devices" line item (~$12.9B/quarter as of Q3 2025), which also includes YouTube Premium, Pixel, Google One, etc. Google TV's specific contribution is not broken out but is likely a small fraction given it hasn't reached break-even.

## Antitrust

**Jan 2026:** Federal judge ruled Google must face consumer antitrust lawsuit alleging illegal dominance in online search market. Adds to ongoing DOJ case.
