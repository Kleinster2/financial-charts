## Why Sapir Organization matters

Family-controlled NYC developer with an outsized history relative to current scale. Founded by taxi-driver-turned-billionaire [[Tamir Sapir]], the firm assembled a trophy Manhattan portfolio during the 1990s downturn, executed the largest single-building sale in US history (11 Madison Avenue, $2.6B), partnered with [[Trump Organization]] on Trump SoHo, and is now unwinding through asset sales and bankruptcy proceedings.
