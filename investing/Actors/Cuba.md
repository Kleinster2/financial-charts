**Cuba** — Communist island nation 90 miles from Florida. US embargo since 1962. Potential opening would benefit tourism, telecom, consumer sectors.

## Why Cuba matters

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Population | ~11M |
| GDP | ~$100B |
| Distance to US | 90 miles (Florida) |
| US diaspora | ~1.5M (mostly Florida) |
| Regime | Communist (since 1959) |
| US policy | Embargo, sanctions |

---

## The embargo

**Longest US embargo in history (1962-present):**

| Restriction | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Trade | Mostly banned |
| Travel | Restricted (categories) |
| Investment | Prohibited |
| Remittances | Limited, variable by administration |
| Financial | Cut off from US banking |

**Exceptions:** Food/medicine exports, licensed travel, limited remittances.

## Economic profile

| Sector | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Tourism | Largest earner (~$3B pre-COVID) |
| Remittances | ~$3B/year from diaspora |
| Sugar/tobacco | Traditional exports |
| Nickel/cobalt | Mineral resources |
| Biotech | Surprisingly advanced (vaccines) |
| Oil | Limited offshore (unexplored) |

**Infrastructure:** Severely degraded — power, telecom, roads, buildings.

## What opening would unlock

| Sector | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| Tourism | Cruise, hotels, airlines — 90 miles from Florida |
| Telecom | Internet/cell near zero — massive buildout |
| Remittances | Unrestricted flows |
| Real estate | Pre-Castro claims, development |
| Consumer | 11M underserved consumers |
| Agriculture | Equipment, inputs |

---

## Geopolitics

| Ally | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| [[Russia]] | Cold War ally, reduced presence |
| [[China]] | Growing economic ties |
| [[Venezuela]] | Oil subsidies (now uncertain post-[[Maduro capture 2026]]) |

**Venezuela link:** Cuba received subsidized Venezuelan oil. Maduro capture may pressure Cuban regime.

---

## Regime change catalysts

| Scenario | Likelihood |
|----------|------------|
| Internal collapse | Low-moderate (economic pressure) |
| US intervention | Low (but Venezuela precedent set) |
| Negotiated transition | Low (no incentive) |
| Death of leadership | Possible catalyst |

**Venezuela precedent:** Maduro capture shows US willing to act. Cuba watching.
