## Prestige fragrance — the growth engine

Coty is the biggest pure-play fragrance beneficiary:

| Licensed brand | Category | Status |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Burberry | Fragrance | Key growth driver |
| Hugo Boss | Fragrance | Strong |
| Calvin Klein | Fragrance | Stable |
| Marc Jacobs | Fragrance | Growing |
| Gucci | Fragrance | [[Kering]] license |
| [[Chloé]] | Fragrance | Stable |
| Davidoff | Fragrance | Mature |

**Fragrance is the fastest-growing beauty category** (+12% in 2024 US prestige). Coty is positioned squarely in this tailwind.

## [[Consumer]] Beauty challenges

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **CoverGirl** | Losing share to [[e.l.f. Beauty]] |
| **Mass cosmetics declining** | Dupe economy shifting share |
| **Rimmel** | [[UK]]-focused, limited growth |
| **Sally Hansen** | Nail category mature |

The prestige/consumer split is a tension: prestige fragrance growing while mass cosmetics structurally challenged.

---

## Wella stake

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stake | 25.8% |
| Value | ~$1.05B (Dec 2024) |
| [[Target]] divestiture | By Dec 2025 |
| Use of proceeds | Deleveraging, shareholder returns |

Coty retained Wella stake after selling control. Full exit would accelerate leverage reduction to ~2x.

## Balance sheet

| Metric | Sep 2024 | Dec 2024 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Net debt | $3.7B | $3.2B |
| Leverage | 3.4x | 2.9x |
| [[Target]] | — | <2.5x (2025) |
| [[Free cash flow]] (FY25E) | — | ~$400M |
