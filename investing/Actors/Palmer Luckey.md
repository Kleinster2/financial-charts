## On building companies (TBPN, Feb 2026)

Started Oculus solo at 19 with no co-founders. Brought on people months later he's "honored to call co-founders" — and others he's not. Multiple people now falsely claim Oculus co-founder status, including one with a documentary in production.

On vibe coding: self-described terrible software engineer. Built Oculus by focusing on opto-mechanics and product integration, not programming. Had he spent 2 years learning to code, he'd have been 2 years behind on everything else. Views vibe coding as especially beneficial for hardware people ("shape rotators, not word cells").

On VR: remains optimistic. [[Meta]] not retreating — fired 10% of Reality Labs but that's ~6 months of natural churn pulled forward. Still spending more on VR than anyone by an order of magnitude. Apple Vision Pro used engineering samples ($1K/display at 10% yield) hauled into the present — future headsets from all players will match that visual fidelity in smaller, lighter form factors.
