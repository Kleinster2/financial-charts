## Brand portfolio

| Brand | FY24 Growth | Positioning |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Shiseido (brand) | -3% | Core prestige skincare |
| Clé de Peau Beauté | +3% | Ultra-luxury skincare |
| NARS | Flat | Prestige makeup |
| **Drunk Elephant** | **-25%** | Premium skincare (acquired $845M, 2019) |

**Drunk Elephant:** Acquired for $845M in 2019, now declining 25% YoY. The biggest write-off risk — paid peak valuation for a social media-driven brand that's fading.

| Core operating profit | ¥36.5B (flat) |

| 9-month FY25 | **Net loss** (vs profit prior year) |

**Sales forecast cut** from ¥995B to ~¥950B ($6.2B) in Q3 2025. Restructuring charges creating near-term losses.

## China problem

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| China % of revenue | ~25-30% (including travel retail) |
| China LFL (FY24) | -4.6% |
| Fukushima water release | Japanese brand boycott in China (2023) |
| Recovery | Not yet visible |
| Strategy | "Cautious" on China spending |

Shiseido has unique Japan-China political risk: the Fukushima water release triggered anti-Japanese sentiment, directly hurting Shiseido's China business beyond normal luxury weakness.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Japan business strong (+10%, ¥28B profit)
- Clé de Peau Beauté growing in ultra-luxury
- Fragrance portfolio gaining (Issey Miyake, Narciso)
- Stock at 8-year lows, priced for failure
- ¥40B+ cost cuts by end of 2025
- Japanese beauty expertise = genuine moat

**Bear:**
- Operating profit -73% — structural, not cyclical?
- Drunk Elephant -25% (potential $845M writeoff)
- Americas losing ¥10B+
- China may not recover (political + economic)
- Dividend cut signals severity
- 7% margin target still far below peers (L'Oréal: 20%)
