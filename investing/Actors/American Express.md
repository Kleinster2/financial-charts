## Business Model

**Closed-loop network** — Unlike Visa/Mastercard (open-loop), Amex controls the entire payment process: issues cards, manages customer relationships, processes transactions, negotiates merchant fees directly.

| Revenue source | % of total | TTM (Q2 2025) |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Merchant discount fees | ~55% | $36B |
| Card fees (annual fees) | ~25% | — |
| Net interest income | ~20% | — |
| **Total** | 100% | $63.4B |

**Spend-centric vs credit-centric:** Most card issuers rely on interest income from revolving balances. Amex earns when cardmembers spend — deliberately targets customers who spend heavily and pay reliably.

## Premium Card Strategy

**Under CEO Stephen Squeri (since 2018):**

- Doubled down on premium annual-fee products (Platinum, Gold, Centurion)
- Shifted from cash back to **experiences** — 27,000 restaurants/venues, 30+ Centurion lounges
- Majority of new acquisitions from **Millennials and Gen Z**
- Premium cardholders spend ~$90,000/year (vs industry avg $8,000)

**Retention:** 97.5% of premium cardholders retained (industry avg: 86%)

**Squeri on pricing:** "If we increase the fee it's to add incrementally more value. Pricing power is tied to the value you provide."

## Competitive Position

| Metric | Amex | Visa | Mastercard |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| US purchase volume share | 19% | 52% | 24% |
| Cards globally | 141M | 1.3B | 1.1B |
| Avg spend per card | $20,000 | ~$8,000 | ~$8,000 |
| Premium card market share | **24%** (leads) | #2 | #3 |
| Corporate/T&E spend share | **42%** (leads) | — | — |

**Network model:**
- **Amex:** Closed-loop (issues cards, processes payments, owns merchant relationships)
- **Visa/MA:** Open-loop (provide rails, banks issue cards)

Amex wins on spend per card and premium segment; loses on volume and merchant acceptance.

## Why Amex Matters

**Premium consumer indicator:** Amex spending data is a leading indicator for high-income consumer health. T&E trends signal travel/leisure demand.

**Closed-loop moat:** Unlike V/MA, Amex owns the customer relationship. Can offer differentiated rewards, experiences, and data insights.

**Generational shift:** Successfully attracting younger affluent consumers — "aspirational, not exclusive."

---

## Risks

- **Merchant acceptance:** Still lower than V/MA, especially internationally
- **Economic sensitivity:** Premium spending vulnerable to recession
- **Competition:** Chase Sapphire, Capital One Venture competing for premium segment
- **Regulation:** Interchange fee caps could pressure merchant discount rates
