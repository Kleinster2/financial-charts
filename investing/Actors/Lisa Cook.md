## Trump firing attempt

**Timeline:**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Aug 25, 2025** | Trump announces removal, citing "deceitful and potentially criminal conduct" |
| **Aug 2025** | Cook files federal lawsuit, calls dismissal unlawful and politically motivated |
| **Jan 21, 2026** | Supreme Court hearing — **6+ justices skeptical**, including Trump appointees |

**The allegations:**
- Claimed two properties (Michigan, Georgia) as "primary residences" in June/July 2021
- Could have led to lower mortgage rate, smaller down payment
- Cook denies allegations
- NBC obtained bank documents appearing to contradict fraud claim

**Federal law:** Governors can only be removed "for cause" — intended to protect Fed independence.

**No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in 112 years.**

## Supreme Court hearing (Jan 21, 2026)

**Outcome:** Court appears likely to block firing.

**Powell's assessment (Jan 29, 2026):**
> "That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history."

**Key moments:**
- [[Jerome Powell]] and Ben Bernanke watched from gallery
- At least 6 justices questioned the administration's arguments
- Trump appointees Kavanaugh and Barrett among skeptics

**Kavanaugh's warning:**
> "Because if this were set as a precedent... what goes around, comes around. All the current president's appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20th, 2029."

**Cook's statement:**
> "This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure."

## Why this matters for markets

The Cook case is the legal front in the broader [[Fed independence]] battle:

| If Cook is fired | If Cook is protected |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Precedent for removing Fed governors | Independence preserved |
| Powell vulnerable | Fed insulated from political cycle |
| Bond vigilante risk | Status quo maintained |
| Dollar/gold volatility | Market stability |
