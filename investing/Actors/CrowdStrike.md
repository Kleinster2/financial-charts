## China cybersecurity ban (Jan 2026)

**Banned by Beijing** — China instructed companies to stop using CrowdStrike products and replace with domestic alternatives by H1 2026.

**CrowdStrike response:** "We do not sell into China and do not have offices, hire people or host infrastructure there, and thus could only be negligibly affected."

**Rationale:** Beijing fears Western cybersecurity software could collect and transmit confidential information abroad.
