**OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control)** — US Treasury agency enforcing financial sanctions. Controls who can access US financial system.

---

## Why OFAC matters

| Function | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| SDN List | Freezes assets, blocks transactions |
| Sectoral sanctions | Targets industries (oil, finance) |
| Secondary sanctions | Punishes third parties |
| License decisions | Grants exceptions (e.g., [[Chevron]] Venezuela) |

**Key lever:** OFAC decides who can use US dollars and access US banks.

## Major programs

| Target | Sanctions type |
|--------|---------------|
| Russia | Comprehensive (2022+) |
| Iran | Comprehensive |
| [[Venezuela]] | Sectoral (oil), partial lift |
| North Korea | Comprehensive |
| China (select) | Targeted entities |

## SDN List

**Specially Designated Nationals — frozen out of US system:**

- Cannot transact in USD
- US persons cannot deal with them
- Assets in US jurisdiction frozen
- Global banks comply (fear of secondary sanctions)

**Power:** Dollar dominance makes OFAC sanctions global.

## Venezuela case study

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2019 | Sanctions on PDVSA, oil sector |
| 2019-2022 | [[Chevron]] wind-down license only |
| 2022 | Biden grants Chevron operating license |
| 2026 | [[Maduro capture 2026]] — status uncertain |

OFAC licenses = permission to operate despite sanctions.

## How it affects investments

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| New sanctions | Target assets frozen, stocks crash |
| Sanctions lifted | Rally in target country/sector |
| Secondary sanctions | Third-party exposure risk |
| License granted | Beneficiary gains exclusive access |

## Relationship to BIS

| Agency | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| [[BIS]] | Technology/goods exports |
| **OFAC** | Financial sanctions, asset freezes |

BIS = what you can sell. OFAC = who you can transact with.
