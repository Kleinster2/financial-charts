## AI data center push

**Late but big:**
- Silicon One custom ASICs
- 400G/800G switches
- AI networking fabric
- Competing with Arista

---

## TCJA repatriation (2018)

Cisco held ~$70B overseas pre-[[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]]. Repatriated $67B and deployed primarily into buybacks.

---

## Splunk acquisition

**$28B deal (2024):**
- Observability/security
- Recurring revenue
- Enterprise software
- AI operations angle

---

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | Cisco |
|---------------|-------|
| [[Arista Networks]] | Smaller in AI DC |
| NVIDIA (Mellanox) | Ethernet vs InfiniBand |
| Juniper | Being acquired by HPE |
| Broadcom | More enterprise focus |

Legacy strength, AI weakness.

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Arista in AI | Lost hyperscaler share |
| NVIDIA InfiniBand | AI cluster alternative |
| Enterprise slowdown | Core market mature |
| Transformation | Software pivot slow |

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Massive installed base
- Enterprise relationships
- Splunk recurring revenue
- Dividend income
- AI catch-up potential

**Bear:**
- Lost hyperscaler AI race
- Arista/NVIDIA ahead
- Legacy business declining
- Slow transformation
