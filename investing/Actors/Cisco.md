## AI data center push

### Silicon One G300 (Feb 10, 2026)

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Throughput | 102.4 Tbps |
| Process | [[TSMC]] 3nm |
| Cooling | 100% liquid option (~70% energy improvement) |
| GPU utilization | +28% job completion time |
| Network utilization | +33% |
| Availability | H2 2026 |

Unveiled at Cisco Live EMEA (Amsterdam). Targets gigawatt-scale AI clusters. "Shock absorber" features handle traffic spikes. Competing with [[NVIDIA]] (networking in Vera Rubin), [[Broadcom]] (Tomahawk), and [[Arista Networks]] for the $600B AI infrastructure spend.

### Q2 FY2026 AI orders

Hyperscaler AI infrastructure orders hit $2.1B in the quarter, with networking product orders accelerating to >20% YoY. This is Cisco's most credible signal yet of regaining AI share.

## TCJA repatriation (2018)

Cisco held ~$70B overseas pre-[[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]]. Repatriated $67B and deployed primarily into buybacks.

---

## Splunk acquisition

$28B deal (2024):
- Observability/security
- Recurring revenue
- Enterprise software
- AI operations angle

---

## Competitive position

| vs Competitor | Cisco |
|---------------|-------|
| [[Arista Networks]] | Smaller in AI DC |
| NVIDIA (Mellanox) | Ethernet vs InfiniBand |
| Juniper | Being acquired by HPE |
| Broadcom | More enterprise focus |

Legacy strength, AI weakness.

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Arista in AI | Lost hyperscaler share |
| NVIDIA InfiniBand | AI cluster alternative |
| Enterprise slowdown | Core market mature |
| Transformation | Software pivot slow |

---

## Investment case

Bull:
- Massive installed base
- Enterprise relationships
- Splunk recurring revenue
- Dividend income
- AI catch-up potential

Bear:
- Lost hyperscaler AI race
- Arista/NVIDIA ahead
- Legacy business declining
- Slow transformation
