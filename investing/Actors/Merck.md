**Merck** — [[Keytruda]] dominance ($31.7B, world's best-selling drug). Patent cliff Dec 2028. 80 Phase 3 trials, $70B+ revenue opportunity by mid-2030s. Gardasil struggling in [[China]].

## Why Merck matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | MRK (NYSE) |
| [[Keytruda]] revenue | **$31.7B** (2025E, 49% of sales) |
| Patent expiry | **December 2028** (US) |
| Market cap | ~$250B |
| Valuation | 20x 2026E, **11x 2027E** (margins bounce back) |
| 3-year return | **+11%** (70pts below S&P 500) |
| Phase 3 pipeline | **80 treatments** |

## [[Keytruda]] franchise

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | **$31.7B** (2025E) |
| Share of total sales | **49%** |
| Indications | 40+ cancer types |
| Market position | \#1 cancer drug globally (or \#2 behind tirzepatide combined) |
| Patent expiry | **December 2028** (US) |

**The cliff:** [[Keytruda]] is half of Merck revenue. December 2028 expiry is existential — but AbbVie navigated a similar cliff with Humira and returned 460% over the following decade.

**Patent thicket defense:** Merck has prepared a dense web of related patents. **[[Keytruda]] Qlex** — new subcutaneous injection — offers faster delivery than IV version + newer patents extending exclusivity.

## Other key products

| Product | Category | Revenue | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Gardasil** | HPV vaccine | $8B+ | **[[China]] declining** — economic downturn + cheaper domestic alternatives |
| Lagevrio | COVID antiviral | Declining | |
| Animal Health | Veterinary | $6B+ | |
| Januvia/Janumet | Diabetes | LOE pressure | |

## Patent cliff strategy

| Approach | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **[[Keytruda]] Qlex** | Subcutaneous injection — faster delivery + newer patents |
| **Patent thicket** | Dense web of related patents beyond composition of matter |
| Label expansion | More indications |
| Combinations | ADCs, other modalities |
| M&A | Pipeline acquisition ([[Revolution Medicines]] $32B in talks) |

**Revenue opportunity:** Management estimates **$70B+** from new drugs by mid-2030s — more than double [[Keytruda]]'s projected 2028 sales.

**AbbVie parallel:** [[AbbVie]] faced a similar cliff with Humira (63% of revenue, composition patent expired Dec 2016). Patent thicket + biosimilar complexity delayed real competition until 2024. Surplus cash funded Skyrizi/Rinvoq. Stock returned 460% over the decade. Merck bull case is a repeat.

## Pipeline

**80 treatments in Phase 3** clinical trials (last step before approval).

| Asset | Indication | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| MK-2870 | ADC (HER2) | Phase 3 |
| V116 | Pneumococcal vaccine | FDA approved |
| Sotatercept | PAH | Approved |

**Key Phase 3 readouts:**

| Timeline | Indications |
|----------|-------------|
| **2026** | HIV, diabetic macular edema, ulcerative colitis |
| **2027** | Influenza, various cancers |

## Recent M&A

| [[Target]] | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Prometheus | $10.8B | Immunology |
| Acceleron | $11.5B | Sotatercept |

**Strategy:** Diversify beyond [[Keytruda]].

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- 11x 2027E earnings — temporarily depressed by dealmaking/trial costs
- $70B+ revenue opportunity from new drugs (2x [[Keytruda]] 2028E)
- Patent thicket + [[Keytruda]] Qlex may delay biosimilar erosion
- 80 Phase 3 trials — diversified shots on goal
- AbbVie navigated identical situation and returned 460%

**Bear:**
- 2028 patent cliff looming — 49% revenue concentration
- Gardasil declining in [[China]] (domestic competition + economic downturn)
- M&A execution risk ([[Revolution Medicines]] $32B)
- 3-year return just +11% — market already pricing pessimism, but cliff may be worse than AbbVie's

## TCJA repatriation (2018)

Merck repatriated significant overseas cash under the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] one-time tax holiday. Deployed into M&A to address [[Keytruda]] patent cliff.
