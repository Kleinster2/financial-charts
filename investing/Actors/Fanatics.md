## Company overview

Fanatics is the largest licensed sports merchandise company in the world and has expanded into a multi-vertical sports platform spanning e-commerce, trading cards/collectibles, sports betting, events, and live commerce. Founded in 1995 as Football Fanatics by brothers Alan and Mitch Trager, the company was transformed after [[Michael Rubin]] acquired it in 2011 and pivoted from a traditional retailer into a vertically integrated digital sports platform.

The company holds exclusive licensing deals with the [[NFL]], [[MLB]], [[NBA]], [[NHL]], [[MLS]], [[Formula One]], and college programs for merchandise. It controls manufacturing, distribution, and retail channels, enabling 40%+ gross margins vs. 15-20% for traditional retail. When a team wins a championship, Fanatics can have merchandise available within minutes.

| CEO | [[Nick Bell]] |

Exclusive trading card licenses:

| League/Property | Deal length | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| [[MLB]] + [[MLBPA]] | Long-term (through 2045) | Active since 2022 via [[Topps]] acquisition |
| [[NBA]] + [[NBPA]] | 10+ years | Launched Oct 2025 (Topps NBA cards, first since 2009-10 season) |
| [[WNBA]] | Multi-year | Launched 2025 season |
| [[NFL]] + [[NFLPA]] | 20 years | Starts Apr 1, 2026 (NFLPA moved up from original 2026 start) |
| [[Premier League]] | Long-term | Active |

The NFL transition on April 1, 2026 is the final major license migration from [[Panini]]. Fanatics plans Topps-branded NFL flagship releases, Chrome, Bowman-style prospect products, and NFL Debut Patch autograph cards (game-worn rookie debut jersey patches, 1/1 per player).

Fanatics also launched NBA Collect by Topps, an official digital trading card app, in November 2025.

### Fanatics Betting & Gaming (~$300M revenue, 4% of total)

Online sports betting launched via acquisition of [[PointsBet]] US operations (2024). Fastest-growing segment but still loss-making.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (2024) | ~$300M |
| Share of total | ~4% |
| States live | 24 states + DC |
| Market coverage | ~95% of US addressable market |
| CEO | [[Matthew King]] |
| iGaming states | 4 (MI, NJ, PA, WV) |
| Market share | ~6.7% (Jan 2025) |

Competitive position (US online sports betting, Jan 2025):

| Operator | Market share |
|----------|-------------|

| [[DraftKings]] | 36.3% |
| [[BetMGM]] | 7.5% |
| Fanatics | 6.7% |
| [[Caesars Digital]] | 5.3% |

Key differentiator: FanCash loyalty program bridges betting, merchandise, and collectibles. Unlike [[FanDuel]] and [[DraftKings]] which recirculate value through bonus bets, Fanatics extends rewards into merchandise redemption.

| [[SoftBank]] | Venture | Multiple rounds |
| [[Silver Lake]] | PE | Multiple rounds; co-CEO on board |
| [[Fidelity Investments]] | Mutual fund | Multiple rounds |

### Funding rounds

| Date | Round | Amount | Valuation | Lead investors |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Dec 2022 | Series G | $700M | $31B | [[Clearlake Capital]], LionTree |
| Apr 2022 | Series F | $1.5B | $27B | [[NFL]], [[MLB]], players' unions |
| Aug 2021 | Series E | $325M | $18B | |
| Mar 2021 | Series D | $350M | $12.8B | |
| Earlier rounds | Multiple | ~$1.97B | Various | [[SoftBank]], [[Silver Lake]], [[Fidelity Investments]], others |

### Valuation trajectory

| Date | Valuation | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Dec 2022 | $31B | Peak; $700M Series G |
| Apr 2022 | $27B | $1.5B round with league investors |
| Aug 2021 | $18B | |
| Sep 2024 | ~$25B | Bloomberg: exploring tender offer |
| Q3 2024 | $16-20B | Secondary market (Hiive/Caplight estimates) |
| Jan 2026 | ~$25B | Private market estimate (based on ~$13B revenue run rate) |

The gap between the $31B last-round valuation and $16-20B secondary market pricing reflects broader private market corrections and concerns about betting segment losses.

---

## IPO status

Fanatics has not filed an S-1 with the SEC as of early 2026. Key IPO-related moves:
- Hired [[Deborah Crawford]] (ex-[[Meta]] IR) as first Head of Investor Relations (2023)
- CFO [[Glenn Schiffman]] said in 2023 IPO would come in "12 to 24 months" — that window has passed
- [[Glenn Schiffman]] added to board of directors (2025) — governance step toward public readiness
- Bloomberg reported Sep 2024 tender offer exploration at $25B valuation
- No S-1 filing, no confirmed timeline
- Secondary market pricing ($16-20B) below last round ($31B) may be deterring listing

Industry expectation is that Fanatics will eventually IPO, but declining private valuations and betting segment losses suggest no imminent timeline. The company is prioritizing profitability and scale across segments before going public.

## Rubin sports team divestment

[[Michael Rubin]] completed his divestment from Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) in October 2022, selling his ~10% stake in the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[New Jersey Devils]]. He had held the stake since the 2011 founding investment group ($280M bid led by [[Josh Harris]] and [[David Blitzer]]).

Reason: NBA and NHL ownership rules prohibit owning a team while operating a sports betting platform. The sale cleared the path for Fanatics Sportsbook.

Buyer: [[David Adelman]] (chairman of 76 Devcorp, the company building the new 76ers arena in downtown Philadelphia).

## Financial overview

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025E | 2026E |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Total revenue | ~$6.1B | ~$7.0B | $8.1B | ~$12B | ~$13B |
| Commerce revenue | | | ~$6.2B | | |
| Collectibles revenue | | | ~$1.6B | | |
| Betting revenue | | | ~$300M | | |
| Cash on balance sheet | | | | ~$1B | |

Rubin stated in June 2025 the company is "making good profits today" with "close to $1 billion on the balance sheet in cash."

Collectibles segment: EBITDA margin >20%, significantly outperforming comparable public companies like [[Funko]] (4.5% EBITDA margin).

Betting segment: still loss-making. Lost $1.3M in a single week in New York alone (Oct 2024, heavy favorites week). Heavy customer acquisition spending. Projected to reach 40% of total revenue by 2027 if growth trajectory holds.

## Competitive landscape

### Merchandise & e-commerce

| Competitor | Comparison |
|------------|------------|
| [[Nike]] | Partner (Fanatics distributes Nike fan gear) but also competitor in direct-to-consumer |
| [[Lids]] | Hat/cap retail; niche competitor |
| [[Dick's Sporting Goods]] | General sporting goods retail |
| League direct stores | Supplementary to Fanatics platform |

Fanatics' exclusive licensing moat is its primary competitive advantage. Vertical integration (manufacturing through retail) enables rapid response to events and 40%+ gross margins.

### Trading cards & collectibles

| Competitor | Status |
|------------|--------|
| [[Panini]] | Losing all major US league licenses by Apr 2026; filed antitrust lawsuit |
| [[Upper Deck]] | Retains [[NHL]] license; niche player |
| [[Funko]] | Pop culture collectibles; 4.5% EBITDA margin vs. Fanatics' >20% |
| Independent card companies | Unlicensed products only after Fanatics consolidation |

Fanatics' consolidation of MLB, NBA, and NFL exclusive trading card rights is unprecedented. [[Panini]]'s antitrust lawsuit alleges monopolization of the sports card market. Fanatics reportedly offered [[Panini]] $2B+ in 2022 to exit early; negotiations collapsed.

### Sports betting

| Competitor | Revenue (trailing) | Market share |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [[FanDuel]] ([[Flutter Entertainment]]) | ~$6.4B (Flutter US) | 36.9% |
| [[DraftKings]] | ~$4.6B | 36.3% |
| [[BetMGM]] ([[MGM Resorts]] / [[Entain]]) | | 7.5% |
| Fanatics | ~$300M | 6.7% |
| [[Caesars Digital]] | | 5.3% |

Fanatics' cross-platform strategy (bet, collect, shop in one ecosystem) is unique, but the gap to [[FanDuel]] and [[DraftKings]] is enormous. The company is competing to be the clear #3 US sportsbook.

|---------|------|---------|
| [[NFL]] | Exclusive merchandise + trading cards | 20-year trading card deal; NFL invested $320M |
| [[MLB]] / [[MLBPA]] | Exclusive merchandise + trading cards | Through 2045; deal worth ~$2B to MLBPA over life |
| [[NBA]] / [[NBPA]] | Exclusive merchandise + trading cards | 10+ year deal; launched Oct 2025 |
| [[NHL]] | Exclusive merchandise | Trading cards remain with [[Upper Deck]] |

| [[Dallas Cowboys]] | Exclusive merchandise | 10-year deal |
| [[Boyd Gaming]] | Missouri market access | Sportsbook license + retail locations |
| [[OpenBet]] | Compliance technology | RG (responsible gambling) tools for sportsbook |
| OBB Media | Events production | Long-term deal for Fanatics Fest |

---

## Loyalty ecosystem: Fanatics ONE & FanCash

Launched Aug 2025. Fanatics ONE is a unified loyalty program spanning merchandise, collectibles, and betting. FanCash currency earned across all platforms and redeemable for licensed merchandise. This cross-platform flywheel is Fanatics' core strategic differentiator vs. pure-play competitors.

---

## Layoffs & restructuring

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| Nov 2025 | Riverview, FL distribution center closure | 286 employees affected; WARN Act investigation by Strauss Borrelli PLLC |
| Feb 2024 | Commerce restructuring | 100+ jobs cut (<1% of workforce); included Easton, PA factory (former [[Majestic Athletic]] facility making MLB uniforms) |
| Jan 2024 | Jacksonville warehouse closure | 218 employees; facility closed Aug 2024 |

The distribution center closures reflect supply chain consolidation, not revenue decline. However, [[Glassdoor]] reviews cite annual layoff cycles and scope creep concerns.

---

## Legal challenges

| Case | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| [[Panini]] antitrust lawsuit | Discovery ongoing, no trial date | Alleges Fanatics monopolizing US sports card market by locking up all major league licenses |
| WARN Act investigation | Under investigation | Strauss Borrelli investigating whether Fanatics gave proper 60-day notice for Riverview layoffs |
| Australian trademark | On appeal | Appealing to Australian High Court |
| Employee poaching litigation | Various | Aggressive hiring tactics reportedly incurring legal costs |

The [[Panini]] case is the most significant. Panini argues Fanatics' exclusive 10-20 year deals with MLB, NBA, and NFL foreclose meaningful competition. Fanatics countersued. If Panini prevails, it could force licensing changes across the industry.

---

## 2026 outlook

Catalysts:
- NFL trading card launch (Apr 1, 2026) completes the license consolidation
- [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] in North America — merchandise opportunity + Fanatics Fest NYC alignment
- Betting segment scaling toward profitability
- Prediction markets (Fanatics Markets) in states without legal sports betting
- Potential IPO if private valuations stabilize

Risks:
- Betting losses continue to drag on overall profitability
- [[Panini]] antitrust ruling could force licensing restructuring
- Secondary market valuation ($16-20B) well below $31B peak — down-round IPO risk
- Customer acquisition costs in betting remain high
- Distribution center closures and layoffs signal margin pressure in commerce
- Regulatory expansion in sports betting could slow state-by-state rollout
