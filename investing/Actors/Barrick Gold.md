## Copper growth — the transformation thesis

Copper is the central growth story. Target: **40% of EBITDA by 2030**, up from ~15% in 2023. Long-term vision: 50/50 gold/copper revenue split by 2035.

| Asset | Current | Post-expansion | Timeline |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Lumwana | ~120kt/yr | 240kt/yr | $2B Super Pit, 2028–2030 ramp |
| Reko Diq | 0 (construction) | Phase 1: 200kt, Phase 2: 400kt | Late 2028 first production |
| Zaldívar ([[Chile]], 50% JV) | Maintained | Stable | Ongoing |

**Lumwana Super Pit:** Incremental IRR of 20% at $4.13/lb copper. Post-expansion C1: ~$1.85/lb (first quartile). Reserves grew from 3.0Mt to 8.3Mt contained copper. Cumulative projected FCF: $15.2B over mine life.

**Reko Diq:** $5.5B Phase 1, $3.5B Phase 2. 37-year mine life. Up to $3B project financing. Fluor selected as EPCM. Komatsu $440M equipment deal signed.

Board authorized preparations Feb 2026. Planned spinoff of North American gold assets to unlock premium-jurisdiction value currently masked by geopolitical discount.

**NewCo would include:** Nevada Gold Mines, Pueblo Viejo, Fourmile discovery. Targeted late 2026.

## Production outlook (10-year)

| Year | Gold (M oz) | Copper (kt) | Catalyst |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 2025 (actual) | 3.26 | 220 | Baseline (excl. Loulo most of year) |
| 2026 | 2.90–3.25 | 190–220 | Trough year, Loulo ramping |
| 2027 | Higher | Higher | Cortez, Loulo, Kibali, NGM improvements |
| 2028 | Higher | Step-up | Lumwana expansion, Reko Diq Phase 1 first production |
| 2029–2030 | 4.1–4.6 | ~450 | Full ramp — 30% growth from 2024 baseline |

Copper expected to represent ~30% of production by 2029, ~40% of EBITDA by 2030.

## Competitive position

| Miner | Gold (2025) | Copper | Forward P/E | Geo risk |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| [[Newmont]] | ~5.9M oz | Minimal | ~14.7x | Moderate |
| [[Agnico Eagle]] | 3.44M oz | None | ~17.9x | Low |
| **Barrick** | 3.26M oz | 220kt | ~14.7x | High |
| AngloGold | ~2.5M oz | None | — | High |

Barrick dropped from #2 to #3 in gold production in 2025 due to Mali shutdown. Targets regaining #2 by 2027–2028. **Differentiator:** No other gold major has comparable copper optionality.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Record financials: $8.2B EBITDA, $3.9B FCF, net cash $2.0B
- Copper growth: Lumwana + Reko Diq → 450kt by 2030 (40% of EBITDA)
- 30% gold-equivalent production growth by 2030, organically funded
- Fourmile: 15.6M oz at 17+ g/t — potential generational gold discovery
- NewCo IPO could unlock $60B+ premium-jurisdiction value
- Cheapest major on PEG basis (0.61x)
- Mali resolved with 10-year extension
- 89M oz gold reserves, 18M tonnes copper reserves

**Bear:**
- Geopolitical concentration: Mali (seized once), [[DRC]], Pakistan, PNG
- 2026 is a production trough year (2.90–3.25M oz)
- Reko Diq: $5.5B+ in Balochistan with significant security costs
- AISC guided at $1,760–1,950/oz in 2026 (above peers)
- CEO transition — Mark Hill still unproven
- Mali settlement ($430M) + impairment ($1.04B) sets precedent
- Gold/copper price sensitivity on growth thesis
