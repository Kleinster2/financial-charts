## Competitive impact

**Disrupted social media advertising:**

| Platform | TikTok impact |
|----------|---------------|
| [[Meta]] | Instagram Reels launched as response; engagement shift from Feed/Stories |
| [[Snap]] | Spotlight underperforming vs For You algorithm |
| [[Google\|YouTube]] | Shorts launched as response |

TikTok's algorithm is considered best-in-class for content discovery. Competitors copied short-form format but struggle to match engagement.

## Revenue breakdown

| Source | Share |
|--------|-------|
| Advertising | 77% |
| Commerce (TikTok Shop) | ~15% |
| In-app purchases | ~8% |

## US ownership transition (2024-2026)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Apr 2024 | Congress passes PAFACA (divestiture-or-ban law) |
| Jan 17, 2025 | Supreme Court upholds ban |
| Jan 19, 2025 | TikTok briefly goes dark in US |
| Jan 20, 2025 | Trump EO delays enforcement 75 days |
| Apr 4, 2025 | Another 75-day extension (to Jun 19) |

| Sep 14, 2025 | Framework deal announced |
| Dec 18, 2025 | TikTok signs deal |

### Ownership structure

**TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC** — established Jan 22, 2026.

| Owner | Stake | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| [[Oracle]] | 15% | Managing investor, hosts data infrastructure |
| [[Silver Lake]] | 15% | Managing investor, PE firm |
| [[MGX]] | 15% | Managing investor, Abu Dhabi sovereign fund |
| [[ByteDance]] | 19.9% | Largest single stake (just under 20% cap) |
| Other investors | 35.1% | See below |

**Other investors (35.1% combined):**
- **Michael Dell family office** — personal investment vehicle of [[Dell]] founder
- **Vastmere Strategic Investments** — affiliate of [[Susquehanna]], existing ByteDance investor
- [[General Atlantic]] affiliates — existing ByteDance investor
- [[TPG]], [[DXC Technology]], others

**Valuation:** ~$14B (per VP Vance), though prior estimates ranged $35-50B.

### Governance

**7-member board**, majority American:

| Member | Role | Representing |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Adam Presser | CEO, TikTok USDS | Operations (former TikTok Trust & Safety head) |
| Shou Chew | Board seat | [[ByteDance]] / TikTok global |
| Egon Durban | Board | [[Silver Lake]] co-CEO |
| Kenneth Glueck | Board | [[Oracle]] EVP |
| David Scott | Board + Security Committee | [[MGX]] Chief Strategy & Safety |
| Mark Dooley | Board | [[Susquehanna]] MD |
| TBD | Board | — |

### Technical control

**What the US JV controls:**
- Content moderation for US users
- Data storage — Oracle's US cloud infrastructure
- Algorithm retraining — must use US-only data
- Security mechanisms

**What ByteDance retains:**
- **Algorithm IP** — licensed to JV, not sold
- **Licensing fees** — reportedly up to 50% of US profits
- **E-commerce operations** — TikTok Shop
- **Advertising & marketing** — commercial operations
- **Global TikTok** — all non-US operations unchanged

### Compliance concerns

Critics note the deal may not satisfy PAFACA's requirement to end "all operational relationships" with ByteDance:
- Algorithm remains ByteDance IP (licensed, not divested)
- ByteDance still earns substantial revenue via licensing fees
- E-commerce and ads still ByteDance-controlled
- Chinese engineers may still maintain algorithm code

---

## Algorithm advantage

TikTok's recommendation algorithm is ByteDance's core IP:
- Powered by [[Doubao]] / internal AI models
- Optimizes for engagement (watch time, completion rate)
- Personalization depth exceeds competitors
- Same system powers [[Douyin]] in China

This is why ByteDance retained algorithm ownership even after the US deal — the algorithm is the core value.
