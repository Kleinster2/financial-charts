## Why Macronix matters

NOR flash is entering a structural shortage alongside DRAM — and Macronix has the most differentiated technology roadmap:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 2337.TW (TWSE) |
| NOR flash rank | #2 globally (~16% share) |
| HQ | Hsinchu Science Park, [[Taiwan]] |
| Founded | 1989 by Miin Wu |
| Employees | ~5,500 |
| Patents | 9,200+ |
| Model | IDM (designs + fabricates) |
| Listed | 1995 (first high-tech company on TWSE) |

The top three NOR flash makers ([[Winbond Electronics]], Macronix, [[GigaDevice]]) hold 65-70% of the market. Supply is consolidating and tightening.

## Product focus

**Revenue mix (Q1 2025):**

| Segment | % Revenue | YoY |
|---------|----------|-----|
| NOR Flash | 68% | +19% |
| NAND | 16% | -10% |
| Foundry (FBG) | 9% | -8% |
| ROM | 7% | -17% |

NOR flash share grew from ~50-55% in 2023 to 68% in Q1 2025. ROM declining as Macronix shifts capacity.

**Key product families:**

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **OctaFlash** | High-speed NOR (x8 I/O, 500 MB/s). AECQ-100, ISO 26262 ASIL-D. Partners: [[NVIDIA]], [[NXP]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Renesas]]. |
| **ArmorFlash** | Secure NOR with PUF encryption. PSA Certified Level 1. Targets L2+ ADAS through L5 AD. |
| **ArmorBoot MX76** | Secure boot flash with rollback attack prevention. Announced FMS 2025. |
| **ROM** | World's largest ROM manufacturer (declining share). |

**NOR flash end markets (Q1 2025):** Computing 33%, Automotive 22%, Industrial/Medical/Aerospace 19%, Communication 18%, Consumer 8%.

## 3D NOR flash — the catalyst

Macronix is the first company worldwide to develop 3D NOR flash technology:

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Architecture | 32-layer, 8x capacity over planar 2D NOR |
| First product | Single-chip 4Gb (current 2D NOR maxes at 2Gb) |
| Performance | 200 MHz DTR |
| Manufacturing | Compatible with existing 3D NAND infrastructure |
| Validated | 4Gb on 45nm; migrating select derivatives to 28nm |
| Sampling | H2 2026 |
| Production | 2027 |
| Roadmap | 2Gb, 4Gb, 8Gb through 2029 |

This matters because NOR flash has been capacity-constrained at the high end (256Mb+). 3D NOR breaks that ceiling while leveraging existing fab tooling.

## NOR flash pricing surge

| Period | Price change |
|--------|-------------|
| Q1 2026 | +30% (reported) |
| Q2 2026 | +40-50% QoQ (expected) |

Drivers: supply consolidation (top 3 hold 65-70%), capacity shifting from NOR to NAND at some fabs, demand growth from AI/servers/automotive. Lead times stretching to 6-9 months for some products. Densities 256Mb+ face the most severe allocation.

## Financials

| Metric | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue (NT$B) | 5.9 | 6.1 | 6.8 |
| Gross margin | 13.1% | 17.7% | 15.6% |
| Operating margin | -29.6% | -17.6% | -15.9% |

**Full year 2024:** Revenue NT$25.9B (-6.3% YoY). Net loss NT$3.2B.

**R&D spend:** NT$6.7B in 2024 (20-26% of revenue) — heavy investment in 3D NOR.

Still operating at a loss with negative margins, but revenue is sequentially recovering and NOR pricing tailwinds are accelerating into Q4 2025 / Q1 2026. The stock has priced in the inflection.

**Next earnings:** February 19, 2026.

## Capacity

| Fab | Type | Details |
|-----|------|---------|
| Fab 5 (Hsinchu) | 12-inch (300mm) | Expanding from 20K to 40K wafers/month |
| Fab 2 | 8-inch (200mm) | Legacy production |
| Fab 5 Phase 2 cost | — | NT$41.5B ($1.48B) |

Some NOR capacity being reallocated to MLC NAND production — reducing global NOR supply and tightening the market further.

## Automotive partnerships

Macronix has strong automotive credentials:

| Partner | Integration |
|---------|------------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | DRIVE platform code storage |
| [[NXP]] | S32Z/S32E processor ecosystem |
| [[STMicroelectronics]] | STM32N6 integration |
| [[Renesas]] | R-Car Consortium Proactive Partner |

ASIL-D automotive credentials acquired earlier than most rivals. Automotive NOR market projected at $616M in 2026, growing to $865M by 2031 (7% CAGR).
