|------|---------------|
| Candelaria | $2.05–2.25 |

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Path to 500kt Cu (top-10 globally) within 2–4 years
- Vicuña (with [[BHP]]) is a generational copper-gold discovery
- Caserones outperforming since acquisition
- Geographic diversification (Chile, Brazil, Europe, US)
- Low cash costs, especially Chapada
- Disciplined capital allocation (buybacks + dividends)

**Bear:**
- Vicuña is pre-development — years from production
- [[Chile]] regulatory/permitting risk (Candelaria, Caserones)
- Argentina political risk (Vicuña)
- Production guidance flat 2025→2026 (growth comes later)
- Mid-tier scale means less liquidity
- Labour and water challenges in Atacama

---

## Exploration (2026)

$53M exploration budget, largest allocation to Caserones (39,800m drilling) — targeting Angelica deposit and new targets (Centauro, Cordillera).
