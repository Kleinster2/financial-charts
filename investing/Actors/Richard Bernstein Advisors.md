## "Everything bubble" call (Jan 2026)

**"We're kind of in an everything bubble at the moment. It's not just AI — it's crypto, it's meme stocks, it's SPACs, it's IG credit, it's high-yield credit."** — Contopoulos

### Drivers

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Loose monetary policy | Fed balance sheet |
| Loose fiscal policy | Deficit spending |
| AI capex | $440B Big Tech spend |

### AI credit skepticism

**"What are investors really seeing in technology bonds where you're willing to fund 40-year debt on something that could be obsolete in five or 10 years?"**

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Asymmetric payoff | Credit investors don't benefit if AI booms |
| Obsolescence risk | 40-year bonds on 5-10 year tech |

---

## Current positioning (Jan 2026)

| Asset class | Position | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Corporate credit | **Zero** | Was overweight 1yr ago |
| CLOs | Overweight | Spread pickup |
| MBS | Overweight | Relative value |
| European equities | **Overweight** | Top pick |
| Floating rate | Overweight | Rate hedge |

### Why zero corporate credit

Exited when IG spreads broke below 90 bps (May 2025).

**"When spreads got really below 90, for us the relative value proposition just didn't make sense anymore."**

### European equities thesis

**"Nothing's better than high-quality European stocks. You get fiscal stimulus, monetary policy is reasonably supportive and earnings growth is accelerating."**

## Spread widening catalysts (their view)

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Fed slower to cut | Less easing than priced |
| Growth slowdown | Bigger than expected |
