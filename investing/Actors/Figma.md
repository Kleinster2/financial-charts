## IPO and Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 2026)

Figma went public. Q4 2025 results beat expectations:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | **$303.8M** | +40% |
| Net income | -$226.6M | vs +$33.1M prior year |
| Q1 2026 guidance | $315-317M | +38% YoY (vs $292M expected) |

Shares +15% after-hours, settled +7% on Feb 19. Despite the beat, analysts flagging AI risk — iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) down 20%+ YTD on AI disruption fears across SaaS.

**Anthropic partnership (Feb 17, 2026):** Announced partnership with [[Anthropic]] for AI-powered code-from-designs workflow. Part of Figma's push to build AI into products rather than be disrupted by it.

**Morgan Stanley:** "Best in class growth rates" can't insulate from GenAI disruption fears, but Q4 shows Figma is "a strong participant in the AI innovation cycle, not a company at risk of disruption."

**BofA:** AI monetization timeline on track, but shares could stay pressured until tangible AI revenue disclosure.
