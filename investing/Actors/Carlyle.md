### 2022 CEO crisis

[[Kewsong Lee]] departed abruptly Aug 2022 after falling out with founders ([[David Rubenstein]], [[William Conway Jr.]], [[Daniel D'Aniello]]):
- Lee (CEO 2018-2022) pushed founders to step back, rebuffed their advice
- Stock down 31% YTD — worst among PE peers
- Disagreements over org structure and management style

[[William Conway Jr.]] served as interim CEO until Schwartz arrived. Lee had joined from [[Warburg Pincus]] in 2013, served as co-CEO with [[Glenn Youngkin]] (2018-2020) before becoming sole CEO.

## Charts

![[cg-price.png]]
*CG (+125%) has significantly lagged KKR (+380%) and Blackstone (+185%) since 2020. Schwartz's 2023 arrival stabilized the stock but hasn't closed the gap.*

![[cg-fundamentals.png]]
*Revenue volatile ($800M-$1.6B quarterly) — typical PE cyclicality from lumpy realizations. Net income swung negative in 2020 and late 2023 on markdowns.*
