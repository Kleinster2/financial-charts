# APIs Are Eating Software

**Status:** Proto outline
**Thesis:** The moat question never changes — it just moves down the stack

## Hook

Sam Altman, February 2025: "Someone told me that soon every company will be an API company."

He's right. But that's not the interesting part.

---

## The surface observation

As AI agents become primary consumers of services, the companies that win are those with clean programmatic interfaces. The UI becomes secondary — a convenience layer for humans — while the real product is the endpoint.

- UI-first companies are dead
- "Software is eating the world" → "APIs are eating software"
- The product IS the endpoint

---

## The twist

But API-first isn't automatically safe.

**Winners:** Companies with defensible capabilities behind the API
- Proprietary data (Plaid's bank connections)
- Trained models (OpenAI's weights)
- Licensed content (Bloomberg's data)
- Regulatory moats (Stripe's money transmission licenses)

**Losers:** Thin wrappers around commodity functionality
- APIs that just aggregate other APIs
- Middleware without lock-in
- Anything an agent could route around

---

## The punchline

The moat question never changes. It just moves down the stack.

"What's behind the endpoint that others can't replicate?"

That's the only question that matters. It was the only question that mattered before, too. The difference is that now the answer is immediately testable — an agent can find out in seconds whether your API adds value or just adds latency.
