# Bank Robbers

**Status:** Draft outline
**Thesis:** Bank cronyism is the terminal phase of regime extraction
**Created:** 2026-01-19

## I. Opening — Two collapses, one month apart

*October-November 2025: the same crime on opposite sides of the world*

- **Oct 25:** Ayandeh Bank (Iran) — 7 million depositors, $2.34B trapped
- **Nov 17:** Banco Master (Brazil) — 1.6 million depositors, $7.6B gone
- One theocracy, one democracy. Same playbook. Same timing.
- Hook: These weren't bank failures. They were bank *robberies* — committed by the owners.

---

## II. The old way vs. the new way

*Bank robbers used to break in. Now they own the bank.*

| | Old bank robber | New bank robber |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Entry** | Mask, gun, getaway car | Banking license, political connections |
| **Take** | Vault cash (thousands) | Deposits (billions) |
| **Escape** | Chase, capture | Private jet to Malta, or stay home protected |
| **Who pays** | Bank (insured) | Everyone (inflation, deposit insurance, taxes) |

The gun is obsolete. The banking license is the weapon.

---

## III. The terminal phase thesis

*Bank cronyism isn't a bug — it's the final stage*

**The extraction lifecycle of a regime:**

| Phase | Years | Method | Example |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Early** | 0-15 | Licenses, permits, contracts | Skimming productive economy |
| **Middle** | 15-30 | State enterprises, privatization | IRGC captures assets; empreiteiras get contracts |
| **Terminal** | 30-45+ | Banking system | Direct access to deposits |

**Why banking comes last:**
- Requires *total* institutional capture (judges, regulators, central bank)
- Extracts from *stock* (savings), not *flow* (economic activity)
- Destroys the base you're standing on
- Maximum socialization of losses

**The logic:** When you've already taken the state enterprises, already rigged procurement, already run the privatizations — what's left? The deposits. The middle class savings account. The last thing to loot before the house collapses.

## IV. The two regimes

*Same age, same disease*

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **Founded** | 1979 (Islamic Revolution) | 1985 (Nova República) |
| **Age in 2025** | 46 years | 40 years |
| **Founding promise** | Islamic justice, resistance | Citizenship, democracy |
| **What it became** | IRGC-bonyad extraction | Centrão-bacharel extraction |

**The founders:**
- Khomeini built velayat-e faqih, IRGC, bonyads — for protection and redistribution
- Ulysses Guimarães built the Constitution, PMDB — for rights and representation

**40 years later:** The institutions were captured. The IRGC became a business empire. The Centrão became a permanent government. The founders are dead; their structures serve different masters.

---

## V. The professional classes

*Who actually runs these regimes?*

**Brazil:**
- **Bacharéis** — judges, prosecutors (world's highest judicial salaries, self-regulating)
- **Burocratas** — federal civil servants (job security, pension privileges)
- **Protected industrialists** — beneficiaries of closed economy
- **Bankers** — oligopoly (5 banks = 80% of market, highest spreads globally)

**Iran:**
- **Clerics** — judiciary, Guardian Council (stipends, immunity, bonyad positions)
- **IRGC** — military-economic complex (30-50% of economy)
- **Basij** — foot soldiers (university quotas, job preference)
- **Bonyad managers** — unaccountable patronage

**The functional mapping:**

| Function | Brazil | Iran |
|----------|--------|------|
| Ideological cover | Legal formalism | Religious authority |
| Coercion | Police | IRGC/Basij |
| Economic gatekeeping | Protected capital | IRGC companies |
| Territorial control | Coronéis | Provincial commanders |

## VI. The families that don't rotate

*Democracy without rotation*

**Brazil — same families since redemocratization:**
- Sarney (Maranhão) — 60 years
- Calheiros (Alagoas) — father and son in Senate
- Barbalho (Pará) — father senator, son governor
- ACM dynasty (Bahia) — three generations
- Bolsonaro — patriarch + 4 sons

**Iran — revolutionary dynasties:**
- Khamenei — Supreme Leader + heir apparent son
- Larijani — 5 brothers across all branches
- Rafsanjani network — persists after death

**The Centrão IS these families.** The regime IS these families. Elections determine which coalition is ascendant — not whether the families rule.

---

## VII. The robbers

*Two men who learned the system*

| | Ali Ansari | Daniel Vorcaro |
|--|------------|----------------|
| **Background** | Metals trading, construction | Finance, real estate |
| **Entry to banking** | Founded Tat Bank (2009) | Acquired Banco Máxima (2017) |
| **Political connection** | Mojtaba Khamenei (Leader's son) | STF justices, Centrão bosses |
| **Method** | Shell companies, self-dealing | High-yield CDBs, state bank injection |
| **Personal project** | Iran Mall ($687M "loan") | Under investigation |
| **Escape** | Protected in Iran | Arrested fleeing to Malta |

**Neither was born a crony.** Both built legitimate businesses first. Both *learned* that extraction was possible — and protected. The system taught them what was tolerable.

**The 40-year structure doesn't just allow extraction — it demonstrates it.** Ansari and Vorcaro watched others succeed and copied the playbook.

---

## VIII. The protection

*Why robbers don't go to jail*

**Iran — Ansari vs. the executed:**

| Name | Crime | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Khosravi | $2.6B fraud | Executed |
| Zanjani | $2.7B embezzlement | Death sentence (commuted) |
| **Ansari** | $5B+ self-dealing | **Protected** |

**The difference:** Khosravi fell from favor. Zanjani kept too much. Ansari *shared with everyone* — clerics, IRGC, Ahmadinejad network, Leader's son. No faction wanted investigation because all had received shares.

**Brazil — Vorcaro's coverage:**

| Branch | Who was touched |
|--------|-----------------|
| Executive | Mantega introduced him to Lula; Temer hired as mediator |
| Legislature | Ciro Nogueira, Arthur Lira, Rueda — the "trinca" |
| Judiciary | Moraes's wife: R$129M contract; Toffoli: travel, became case rapporteur |
| Regulators | Meirelles on advisory board; BRB president did his bidding |

**Same method:** Distribute to all factions. Make everyone complicit. Cross-factional protection.

---

## IX. The getaway

*How losses are socialized*

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | CBI prints rials → inflation | FGC payout (R$41B) |
| **Who pays** | Everyone holding rials | Bank industry (ultimately customers) |
| **Visibility** | Hidden (currency collapse) | Visible (largest payout ever) |

**The robber keeps the assets. The public absorbs the loss.**

- Ansari still has Iran Mall, UK properties, Cyprus passport
- Vorcaro had 3 jets, R$280M mansion, stakes in hospital chains

The money is *already gone* before collapse. The bank failure is just when everyone else notices.

---

## X. The voided accountability

*Brazil's theater of prosecution*

**Lava Jato (2014-2021):**
- 174 convictions
- Lula imprisoned
- Odebrecht plea deals

**Then:**
- STF declared Moro "biased"
- All Lula convictions annulled
- Dallagnol barred from public office
- Task force dismantled

**2023:** Lula re-elected. Governs WITH Centrão — the same bloc Lava Jato targeted.

**2025:** STF justices who voided Lava Jato now dine with Vorcaro and handle his case.

**The lesson:** Brazil prosecutes, then voids. Iran skips the theater. Same destination, different path length.

---

## XI. The terminal signal

*What 2025 tells us*

**Both regimes produced their largest bank frauds at the same moment:**
- Ayandeh: largest in Iranian history
- Master: largest FGC payout in Brazilian history

**This is not coincidence.** It's convergent evolution. Both regimes reached the terminal phase simultaneously because:

1. **Prior extraction exhausted** — IRGC already has half the economy; Centrão already controls the budget
2. **Institutional capture complete** — judiciary, regulators, central bank all compromised
3. **Reform windows closed** — Khatami failed (2005), FHC's gains reversed, Lava Jato voided
4. **Nothing left but deposits**

**The regime has eaten everything else. Now it's eating the savings.**

---

## XII. What comes after terminal?

*The question neither regime can answer*

**Iran:**
- Rial collapsed 60% in 2025
- 40% of banking system distressed
- Succession crisis looming (Khamenei is 85)

**Brazil:**
- IMF/World Bank raised concerns
- STF credibility damaged
- But: commodity exports, external accounts, FGC backstop

**The difference:** Brazil has external resources and institutional surface. Iran has neither. But both have the same disease — and bank cronyism is a symptom of late-stage, not a cause.

**The question:** Can a regime survive its terminal phase? Or does eating the deposits trigger the collapse?

---

## XIII. Conclusion — The bank robbers won

*They're not in jail. They're in the system.*

- Ansari is in Tehran, protected by the Leader's son
- Vorcaro is on ankle monitor, his case before captured judges
- The families still rule. The professional classes still extract. The deposits are gone.

**The old bank robber was an outsider who broke the law.**

**The new bank robber IS the law.**

And both regimes — one democratic, one authoritarian — produced the same robber at the same moment. Because after 40 years, the regime doesn't fight crime. The regime *is* the crime.

## Notes for expansion

**What's missing / needs more:**
- [ ] More on reform windows (FHC/Khatami parallel)
- [ ] Specific pension fund losses (Rio teachers losing retirement)
- [ ] International precedents (other 40-year regimes?)
- [ ] The religious dimension (clerics/evangelicals as moral cover)
- [ ] Congealing timeline (when did each regime solidify?)

**Word count estimate:** 4,000-6,000 words fully drafted
