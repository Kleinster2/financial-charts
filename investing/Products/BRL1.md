# BRL1

Real-pegged stablecoin launched by a consortium of Brazil's three largest crypto exchanges: [[Mercado Bitcoin]], [[Bitso]], and [[Foxbit]]. [[Fireblocks]] provides tokenization and custody infrastructure. Fully backed 1:1 by BRL reserves.

Designed to create cross-exchange liquidity and establish industry standards for real-denominated on-chain transactions — eliminating FX conversion for BRL-native crypto trading.

## Why it matters

Exchange consortium model is unusual — three competitors cooperating on shared infrastructure. If BRL1 becomes the default BRL settlement token across major exchanges, it creates a network effect similar to how [[Circle|USDC]] became the default USD rail. Low DEX traction suggests the token circulates primarily within exchange ecosystems, not in open DeFi.
