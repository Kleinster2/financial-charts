## Kling 3.0 — "AI Director" paradigm (Feb 2026)

Major architectural leap. Kuaishou calls it a "unified multimodal framework" — generates synchronized video and audio in a single pass via Multi-modal Visual Language (MVL) training.

| Feature | Kling 2.6 | Kling 3.0 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Resolution | 1080p | **Native 4K** |
| Frame rate | 48fps | **60fps** |
| Duration | 10s | **15s** |
| Multi-shot | No | **Up to 6 shots per clip** |
| Reference video | No | **Yes** |
| Lip-sync languages | 2 | **5** (CN, EN, JP, KR, ES) |
| Audio | Generated separately | **Native single-pass** |

**AI Director:** Instead of generating isolated clips and stitching in post, Kling 3.0 generates up to 6 distinct camera shots within a single 15-second generation. This enables storyboard-style filmmaking from a single prompt.

**Competitive context:** Launched same week as [[Seedance]] 2.0 ([[ByteDance]]). Chinese AI video models are leapfrogging US competitors ([[Sora]], [[Runway Gen]]) on features and accessibility.
