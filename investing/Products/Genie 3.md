## What it does

Genie 3 constructs virtual environments from text prompts -- not static images but interactive worlds with physics and spatial coherence.

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Environment generation | Creates 3D-like interactive worlds from text descriptions |
| Physics simulation | Objects behave with approximate physical realism |
| User interaction | Generated worlds are navigable and manipulable |
| Customization | Can be fine-tuned for domain-specific applications |

## Waymo application (Feb 2026)

[[Waymo]] customized Genie 3 for autonomous driving edge-case training:

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Synthetic footage | Generates driving video as if captured by vehicle cameras |
| Depth perception | Simulates lidar sensor data |
| Dashcam conversion | Takes real-life footage, outputs scene + depth maps for simulation |
| Edge cases | Explores situations never directly observed by fleet |
| Scaling | Helps prepare autonomous systems for new cities |

This matters for safety validation -- NHTSA and NTSB were probing [[Waymo]] after school bus incidents in Austin. Larger synthetic training datasets address the gap between real-world miles and regulatory confidence.

## Game dev / graphics impact

Genie 3 demos triggered selloff in game development and graphics tool companies when released in early Feb 2026. The concern: if AI can generate interactive environments from text, traditional environment art pipelines face disruption.

Applications beyond gaming:
- Autonomous driving (Waymo)
- Robotics sim-to-real transfer
- Content creation / virtual world generation
- Training data synthesis for embodied AI

## Competitors

Other companies building world models for simulation:

| Company | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| [[NVIDIA]] + [[Uber]] | Millions of hours of robotaxi-specific driving data |
| Wayve ([[SoftBank]]-backed) | Own world model for UK robotaxi trials on [[Uber]] platform |
| [[Tesla]] | Built similar simulator for FSD training |

## Investment angle

Not directly investable -- part of [[Google]] / Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG). Genie 3 strengthens the case that Google's AI capabilities extend well beyond chatbots into simulation, robotics, and embodied intelligence.
