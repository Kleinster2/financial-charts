# cREAL

Real-pegged stablecoin native to the [[Celo]] blockchain. Mobile-first DeFi focus. Peaked at $80M monthly trading volume (Nov 2024) but declined to $5M by July 2025 as BRLA and BBRL gained share. Core trading hub via CELO-cREAL pair (~$126M cumulative volume).

Dominated retail and small-value payment use cases before losing momentum.
