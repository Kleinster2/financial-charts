# BR100

[[Biren Tech]]'s flagship AI GPU. 77B transistors on dual-die design. Sanctioned — TSMC access blocked since Oct 2022. Modified versions shipping to China cloud.

## Quick stats (BR100)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Architecture | BiLiren |
| Process | TSMC 7nm |
| Transistors | 77B |
| Die size | 1074mm² (dual-die) |
| HBM2e memory | 64GB (4 stacks) |
| FP32 performance | 256 TFLOPS |
| INT8 performance | 2 PFLOPS |
| Packaging | CoWoS |
| Status | Constrained by [[Export controls]] |

## Version history

| Model | Specs | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **BR100** | 256 TFLOPS FP32, 64GB | Flagship, dual-die |
| **BR104** | 128 TFLOPS FP32 | Scaled-down single-die |
| BR100 (modified) | Reduced specs | Post-sanctions workaround |
| **Biren 106** | 1,000+ TFLOPS BF16 | 2025 launch |

## BR100 vs competitors

| Spec | BR100 | Ascend 910B | A100 |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| HBM | 64GB | 64GB | 80GB |
| FP32 | 256 TFLOPS | — | 19.5 TFLOPS |
| INT8 | 2 PFLOPS | — | 624 TOPS |
| Process | TSMC 7nm | SMIC 7nm | TSMC 7nm |
| Status | Sanctioned | Available | Restricted |

Note: BR100 optimized for different precision than A100. Direct comparison difficult.

## Sanctions impact

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Oct 2022 | Biren added to US Entity List |
| Oct 2022 | [[TSMC]] halted all manufacturing |
| 2023 | Modified BR100 with reduced specs |
| 2024+ | Using older/domestic fabs |

**Workaround:** Degraded specs to fall below export control thresholds. Still shipping but capability-constrained.

## Biren 106 series (2025)

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| BF16 performance | 1,000+ TFLOPS (claimed) |
| Validated workloads | [[Qwen]] QWQ-32B inference |
| Training support | [[DeepSeek]]-V3 full-stack |

Optimizing within sanctions constraints.

---

## Software stack

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| BIRENSUPA | Biren's SDK |
| PyTorch | Supported |
| TensorFlow | Supported |

Smaller ecosystem than CUDA, CANN, or ROCm.

## Competitive position

| vs | BR100 advantage | BR100 disadvantage |
|----|-----------------|-------------------|
| [[Ascend]] | Architecture (pre-sanctions) | Sanctioned, no TSMC |
| [[MLU]] | Performance specs | Cambricon has TSMC access |
| [[H100]] | Available in China | Everything else |

Only sanctioned chip among China's "Four Little Dragons" GPU makers.
