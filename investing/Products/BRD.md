# BRD

[[CF Inovação]]'s yield-bearing stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the [[Brazilian real]]. Backed by [[Treasuries|Brazilian government bonds]] (Tesouro Selic). Unlike standard stablecoins that pocket reserve yield, BRD distributes a portion of the [[Selic]]-linked interest to token holders — on-chain access to Brazil's ~15% policy rate.

Announced Jan 6, 2026 by [[Tony Volpon]] on CNN Brasil's "Cripto na Real." No deployment timeline announced.

| Issuer | [[CF Inovação]] |
| Peg | 1:1 [[Brazilian real]] |

| Status | Pre-launch (no deployment timeline) |

## Mechanism

BRD is structured as a yield-sharing stablecoin — reserves earn Selic-linked returns from Tesouro Selic bonds, and a portion flows to holders. This is distinct from the [[GENIUS Act]] model (US stablecoins explicitly cannot pay yield) and from standard stablecoins like [[Tether|USDT]] and [[Circle|USDC]] that retain all reserve income.

For global investors, BRD offers on-chain carry trade exposure — real-denominated yield without needing a Brazilian brokerage account or custody relationship.

## Competitive landscape

| Token | Issuer | Blockchain | Volume / Circ. | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------|-------|
| [[BBRL]] | [[Braza Group]] | XRPL | $1B Q3 2025 payments | Volume leader. Institutional FX plumbing. |
| [[BRLV]] | [[Crown]] | Multi-chain | ~$19M circ. | Most VC-backed ($13.5M Series A, Paradigm). |
| [[BRZ]] | [[Transfero]] | Polygon | ~$13.6M circ. | Oldest. Most integrated liquidity pairs. |
| [[BRLA]] | BRLA Digital | Polygon | $9M/mo DEX | #1 in unique remittances. Retail focus. |
| [[BRL1]] | [[Mercado Bitcoin]] + [[Bitso]] + [[Foxbit]] | Multi-chain | Low DEX | Exchange consortium. Cross-exchange liquidity. |
| [[cREAL]] | [[Celo]] | Celo | ~$5M/mo (declining) | Mobile-first. Peaked $80M/mo Nov 2024. |
| [[BRD]] | [[CF Inovação]] | TBD | Pre-launch | Only yield-bearing (Selic ~15%). |
| B3 stablecoin | [[B3]] | TBD | H1 2026 launch | Stock exchange settlement layer. Post-Drex. |

Combined real-pegged stablecoin circulation: ~$23M — tiny vs global stablecoin market ($299B). But transaction volume surged 230x since 2021. 60% of Brazil's crypto activity is stablecoin-related (2025). H1 2025 trading volume: $906M.

## Regulatory context

Brazil's new stablecoin regulations took effect Feb 2, 2026. [[Banco Central do Brasil|BCB]] resolutions (Nov 2025) classify stablecoin transactions as foreign-exchange operations — providers face same oversight as currency exchange businesses.

This is a different framework from the US [[GENIUS Act]], which prohibits yield on stablecoins. Brazil's approach potentially enables yield-bearing models like BRD, but subjects them to FX regulation.

Brazil crypto market: 227 billion reais ($42.8B) in transactions, H1 2025. Stablecoins comprised ~90% of volume.

## Why it matters

1. Selic carry trade, tokenized. Brazil's 15% rate is the highest since July 2006. BRD packages that yield into a blockchain-native instrument — potential demand from global DeFi participants seeking real yield.
2. Regulatory arbitrage. US stablecoins can't pay yield ([[GENIUS Act]]). Brazil's framework allows it. Could attract yield-seeking capital specifically because of this gap.
3. Central banker credibility. [[Tony Volpon]]'s BCB pedigree distinguishes BRD from typical crypto launches — institutional signal.
4. Scale question. The entire real-pegged stablecoin market is ~$20M. BRD's success depends on whether institutional demand materializes or this remains a niche.
