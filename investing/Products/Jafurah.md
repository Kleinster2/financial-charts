**Jafurah** — [[Saudi Aramco]]'s flagship unconventional gas development in eastern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Largest liquid-rich shale gas play outside the United States. First gas achieved December 2025. Targeting 2 Bcf/d sales gas + 630,000 bpd of liquids by 2030. Lifecycle investment exceeds $100 billion.

## Why Jafurah matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Operator | [[Saudi Aramco]] |
| Location | Eastern Province, ~300 km south of Dammam, east of [[Ghawar]] |
| Area | ~17,000 km2 |
| Gas-in-place | 229 Tcf (revised up from 200 Tcf in 2023) |
| Condensate-in-place | 75 billion STB |
| Proven reserves (1P) | 15 Tcf raw gas + 2 billion STB condensate |
| Lifecycle capex | >$100 billion |
| First gas | December 2025 |

Jafurah is the cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's gas strategy — displacing crude oil burned for domestic power, freeing barrels for export, and supplying feedstock to an expanding petrochemical sector. Condensate output falls outside [[OPEC]] crude quotas.

## Geology

Target formation is the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain (TWQ) — an organic-rich carbonate mudrock, 110-150 ft thick. This is the same source rock that charged the adjacent [[Ghawar]] super-giant. Mineralogy is ~87% calcite, ~9% anhydrite — a carbonate shale, geologically distinct from the sandstone formations in US plays like the [[Permian Basin]] or [[Marcellus]].

Key technical challenges:
- Requires ceramic proppants (not silica sand) to prevent embedment in soft carbonate
- High-intensity fracturing at 10 clusters/stage (double standard US completions)
- Steep decline curves likely — "Red Queen" drilling treadmill risk
- Water management in arid environment (developing desalinated seawater-based frac fluids)
- Limited global analogues for carbonate unconventional reservoir behavior

## Production targets

| Phase | Timing | Capacity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Online Dec 2025 | 450 MMcf/d raw gas processing; ~200 MMcf/d sales gas at startup, rising to ~650 MMcf/d by end-2026 |
| Phase 2 | 2027 | Additional gas compression, pipelines, Riyas NGL fractionation (Jubail) |
| Full build-out | 2030 | 3.1 Bcf/d raw gas processing |

### 2030 full-rate targets

| Product | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Sales gas | 2 Bcf/d (~334,000 boe/d) |
| Ethane | 418-420 MMcf/d |
| NGLs + condensate | ~630,000 bpd |

First condensate exports began February 2026 — 4-6 cargoes/month of ~500,000 barrels each to Asian buyers. Condensate is ~40% petrochemical-grade naphtha, remainder gasoil and kerosene.

## Capital expenditure

| Package | Value | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| Phase 1 EPC (gas plant, compression, surface) | $10B | Nov 2021 |
| Well tie-in contracts (13 contracts) | $1.6B | 2022-2024 |
| Phase 2 development (16 contracts) | $12.4B | Jun 2024 |
| Master Gas System Phase 3 expansion (15 contracts) | $8.8B | Jun 2024 |
| Unconventional gas rigs (23 rigs) | $2.4B | Jun 2024 |
| Directional drilling (2 contracts) | $612M | Jun 2024 |
| Total identifiable awards | ~$35.8B | |

Aramco redirected $40 billion (2024-2028) from crude capacity expansion toward gas — effectively choosing Jafurah over maximum sustainable crude capacity of 13 million bpd.

### Midstream financing

August 2025: Aramco signed an $11 billion, 20-year lease-and-leaseback deal forming Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC). Aramco holds 51%; a consortium led by [[BlackRock]]'s [[Global Infrastructure Partners]] holds 49%. Consortium includes [[Hassana Investment Company]] ([[Saudi PIF]]'s investment arm), [[Arab Energy Fund]], and [[Aberdeen Investcorp Infrastructure Partners]].

## Strategic logic

Crude displacement: Saudi Arabia burns ~470,000-500,000 bpd of crude for domestic power generation. Domestic gas is priced at ~$2.00-2.50/MMBtu versus Arab Light crude at $70+/bbl. Jafurah alone targets offsetting 300,000-350,000 bpd of crude burn by 2030; the full unconventional program targets ~500,000 bpd.

Power mix: [[Saudi Vision 2030]] targets 50% renewables + 50% gas for power generation — eliminating crude burn entirely. As of mid-2025, Saudi Arabia had already cut oil-for-power consumption by 270,000 bpd.

Petrochemical feedstock: 420 MMcf/d of ethane + NGL output feeds downstream diversification, reducing dependence on crude exports.

Quota arbitrage: Jafurah condensate is not counted in Saudi Arabia's [[OPEC]] crude output quota — incremental export revenue without quota constraints.

GDP impact: Projected to add $20 billion/year to Saudi GDP and create 200,000+ direct and indirect jobs.

Emissions: Replacing ~300,000 bpd of crude burn with gas reduces emissions by an estimated 30 million tonnes CO2/year, supporting Saudi Arabia's net-zero 2060 target.

## Risks

- Carbonate reservoir uncertainty — no global precedent for unconventional carbonate production at this scale; decline rates and long-term recovery factors unknown
- Cost execution — $100B+ lifecycle in a single basin; Phase 1 alone was $24B
- Infrastructure complexity — simultaneous construction of gas plants, 1,500+ km of pipelines, NGL fractionation, compression, and cogeneration
- Cannot fully replace crude burn alone — 2 Bcf/d displaces ~300,000 bpd against 470,000+ bpd of current crude burn; requires renewables and additional gas development
- Decline curve treadmill — unconventional wells typically decline 60-70% in Year 1; sustaining plateau requires continuous capital-intensive drilling
- Water scarcity — hydraulic fracturing at scale in arid environment

## Global context

| Play | Country | Resource | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Jafurah | Saudi Arabia | 229 Tcf GIP | First gas Dec 2025 |
| [[Vaca Muerta]] | Argentina | 308 Tcf recoverable | Producing, setting records |
| Sichuan Basin | China | Largest technically recoverable | Slow development |
| [[Permian Basin]] | US | Largest active globally | Mature, plateau approaching |

Jafurah is the first carbonate unconventional gas play to reach commercial production at scale anywhere in the world.
