## Seedance 2.0 — viral launch (Feb 2026)

Officially unveiled Feb 10, 2026 (select beta) with full launch Feb 12. Immediately went viral:

- Weibo hashtags racked up tens of millions of views
- One viral video (~1M views): Kanye West and Kim Kardashian as characters in an Imperial Chinese palace drama, speaking and singing in Mandarin
- Elon Musk replied to an X post praising the model: "It's happening fast"
- Chinese state media (Global Times, Beijing Daily) framed it as "from DeepSeek to Seedance, China's AI has succeeded"
- Chinese AI company stocks rose on the buzz

**The DeepSeek comparison:** Just as [[DeepSeek]]'s R1 model triggered a "Sputnik moment" in text AI (Jan 2025), Seedance 2.0 is being positioned as the equivalent shock in video AI. Whether it lives up to that framing remains to be seen — it's still in limited beta.

## Controversy: Hollywood IP regurgitation

Deadline (Feb 13, 2026) reported Seedance 2.0 going viral for "regurgitating Hollywood IP on an epic scale" — generating convincing scenes with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and other actors/characters. This raises significant copyright and deepfake concerns that could affect commercial deployment.

## Competitive landscape (Feb 2026)
