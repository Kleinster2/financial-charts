## Seedance 2.0 — viral launch (Feb 2026)

Officially unveiled Feb 10, 2026 (select beta) with full launch Feb 12. Available via Jianying in China; international access via Dreamina/[[CapCut]] (pre-release as of Feb 16). BytePlus ModelArk offered free playground quota. Immediately went viral:

- Weibo hashtags racked up tens of millions of views
- One viral video (~1M views): Kanye West and Kim Kardashian as characters in an Imperial Chinese palace drama, speaking and singing in Mandarin
- Elon Musk replied to an X post praising the model: "It's happening fast"
- Chinese state media (Global Times, Beijing Daily) framed it as "from DeepSeek to Seedance, China's AI has succeeded"
- Chinese AI company stocks rose on the buzz

**The DeepSeek comparison:** Just as [[DeepSeek]]'s R1 model triggered a "Sputnik moment" in text AI (Jan 2025), Seedance 2.0 is being positioned as the equivalent shock in video AI. Whether it lives up to that framing remains to be seen — it's still in limited beta.

## Hollywood IP controversy (Feb 2026)

Seedance 2.0 triggered the most serious AI copyright confrontation yet — generating Hollywood-quality clips using copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses without permission:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 11 | Viral Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt fight clip; Deadpool writer Rhett Reese: "It's likely over for us" |
| Feb 13 | [[Disney]] cease-and-desist via Jenner & Block — called it a "virtual smash-and-grab" treating Disney IP as "free public domain clip art" |
| Feb 13 | [[SAG-AFTRA]]: "unacceptable... undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood" |
| Feb 13 | [[MPA]]: "massive scale" unauthorized use of US IP |
| Feb 14 | [[Paramount Global]] cease-and-desist |
| Feb 15 | Human Artistry Campaign condemned it as "an attack on every creator around the world" |

Generated content included Spider-Man, Star Wars, Stranger Things, Marvel characters — all from 2-line prompts.

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 15 | [[Paramount Global]] cease-and-desist: content "often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly" from Paramount films; cited Star Trek, South Park, Dora the Explorer |
| Feb 15 | [[TechCrunch]]: "Hollywood isn't happy about the new Seedance 2.0 video generator" |
| Feb 16 | ByteDance pledges to "strengthen safeguards" and "respects intellectual property rights" ([[Reuters]], [[BBC]]) |

**Connection to Ellison thesis:** The same [[ByteDance]] pirating American IP has [[Oracle]] (founded by [[Larry Ellison]]) as its US infrastructure partner. Meanwhile Larry's son [[David Ellison]] is acquiring the very studios whose IP Seedance pirates. See [[Ellison AI-IP vertical integration]].

## Competitive landscape (Feb 2026)

| Model | Developer | Key advantage |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Seedance 2.0** | [[ByteDance]] | Viral quality, cinematic output, multimodal |
| [[Kling]] 3.0 | [[Kuaishou]] | Native 4K, 6-shot AI Director, 60fps |
| [[Sora]] | [[OpenAI]] | Brand recognition, safety focus |
| Veo 3.1 | [[Google]] | Integration with Google ecosystem |
| [[Runway Gen]] | [[Runway]] | First-mover in creative tools |

Chinese models ([[Kling]], Seedance) are pulling ahead on features and speed of iteration. US models ([[Sora]], Veo) are more cautious on safety/copyright.
