## Why it leads on volume

Braza Bank ranks 6th in Brazil's interbank FX market (balance sheet >$500M). BBRL inherits that institutional plumbing — few active sending addresses but extraordinary transaction value concentration. The token serves regional trade and payment scenarios, not retail DeFi.

XRPL was chosen for low fees and near-instant settlement. [[Ripple]] partnership provides infrastructure.

## Competitive position

Largest real-pegged stablecoin by transaction volume, though circulation (~$5M on-chain per CoinMarketCap) is modest. The gap between volume and circulation reflects institutional throughput — tokens move fast, don't sit idle.

CEO Marcelo Sacomori projects BBRL capturing significant real-pegged market share by 2026. Braza also issues USDB (USD-pegged) targeting 30% of Brazil's USD stablecoin market.
