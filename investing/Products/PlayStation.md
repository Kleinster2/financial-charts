# PlayStation

[[Sony]]'s gaming platform — the largest segment of its entertainment business. Current generation: PS5 (60M+ installed base). Next generation (PS6) delayed due to [[Memory shortage 2025-2026|memory costs]].

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | [[Sony]] |
| Current gen | PlayStation 5 |
| Installed base | 60M+ (PS5) |
| Next gen | PS6 — delayed, possibly 2028-2029 |
| Business model | Hardware loss, software/services profit |
| Key franchises | God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Helldivers |

## Strategic positioning

PlayStation aims to be "best place to play" (for users) and "best place to publish" (for developers). [[Hiroki Totoki]] describes a two-sided platform:
- First-party studios producing exclusive blockbusters
- Strong third-party publisher relationships driving platform stickiness

## PS6 delay risk

Bloomberg (Feb 2025) reported Sony considering pushing PS6 debut to 2028 or even 2029 due to memory costs at 35%+ of console bill of materials. The traditional model of selling hardware at a loss and profiting on games becomes unsustainable at those memory price levels.

See [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] for the broader dynamic.
