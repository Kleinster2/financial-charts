**FCAS** (Future Combat Air System) — $115B Franco-German-Spanish 6th-generation fighter jet program. Led by [[Dassault Aviation]] and [[Airbus]]. Intended to replace [[France]]'s Rafale and [[Germany]]'s Eurofighter by 2040s. Now in jeopardy from industrial disputes and German ambivalence.

|---------|----------------|------|
| [[France]] | [[Dassault Aviation]] | Lead aircraft designer |

Not just a fighter — a "system of systems" including manned aircraft, loyal wingman drones, and networked combat cloud.

## Crisis (2025-2026)

The program has become the symbol of Franco-German defense friction.

[[Dassault Aviation]] demands a leadership role reflecting its Rafale success and combat aircraft expertise. [[Airbus]] (and Berlin) want equal work share to match equal funding. Dassault has been uncooperative on technology sharing, and Paris has not intervened.

Former [[Airbus]] CEO Tom Enders told the FT (Feb 2026) that FCAS was a "mistake." He dismissed a domestic German fighter jet alternative as "national hubris" and preferred Germany joining the [[UK]]-led [[Global Combat Air Programme]] with [[Italy]] and [[Japan]].

Chancellor [[Friedrich Merz]] has cooled on the project. Berlin is reportedly eyeing its own fighter jet program and its own satellite constellation — moves that, combined with preference for German arms manufacturers, risk turning the "European defense union" into "Germany First."

The Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a parallel Franco-German tank project, is also falling significantly behind schedule.

## Strategic significance

FCAS was meant to reduce European dependence on the American [[F-35]]. If it collapses, Europe loses its path to an independent next-generation combat aircraft.

A purely national German fighter program could never achieve the scale or capability of a consortium program. Combined European NATO spending is expected to reach €831B/year by 2035 — but fragmented national procurement sacrifices interoperability.

Bloomberg's Lionel Laurent (Feb 2026) suggests shrinking FCAS to an interoperable data/combat cloud system that could work with either a Dassault-built aircraft or a [[Global Combat Air Programme]] plane — preserving European interoperability without the industrial deadlock.
