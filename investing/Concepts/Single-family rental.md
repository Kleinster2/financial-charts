## Regional concentration (GAO/Urban Institute 2024)

**Institutional share of SFR market (1,000+ home operators):**

| Metro | Share of rentals | Homes owned |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Atlanta** | **25%** | **72,000** |
| Jacksonville | 21% | — |
| Charlotte | 18% | 24,000 |
| Tampa | 15% | 23,000 |
| Phoenix | — | 33,000 |
| Dallas | — | 27,000 |
| Houston | — | 24,000 |

**Top 6 metros hold 45% of all mega-operator SFR holdings.**

**All-investor concentration (includes mom-and-pop):**

| Market | All investors |
|--------|--------------|
| Asheville, NC | 30% |
| Las Vegas, NV | 26% |
| Memphis, TN | 26% |

**Pattern:** Sunbelt markets with population growth, affordable land, landlord-friendly laws, post-2008 foreclosure inventory.

---

## Policy risk

**[[Institutional homebuying ban]] (Jan 2026):**
- Trump proposed banning large institutional buyers
- Would freeze new acquisitions
- Existing portfolios uncertain (grandfathered?)
- Details pending at Davos

**Political framing:** "Corporate landlords" vs "people living in homes"

**Reality check:** Nationally, institutions own ~3% of SFR stock. But in Sunbelt hotspots like Atlanta (25% of rentals), the concentration is real and politically salient.

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Structural housing shortage
- Rent-vs-buy math favors renting
- [[Build-to-rent]] reduces political heat
- Professional management improves quality

**Bear case:**
- Regulatory overhang
- Rent growth moderating
- Rate cuts could shift demand to ownership
- [[ESG]]/political concerns
