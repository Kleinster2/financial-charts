**Currency swap lines** — Bilateral agreements between central banks to exchange currencies. The Fed's USD network is the global safety net; China's yuan network is the alternative for sanctioned states.

## What swap lines do

```
Normal scenario:
  Foreign bank needs USD → goes to FX market → pays market rate

With swap line:
  Foreign central bank needs USD → activates Fed swap → gets USD at favorable rate
  Foreign central bank needs yuan → activates PBOC swap → gets RMB at favorable rate
```

**Purpose:**
- Provide emergency liquidity in foreign currency
- Stabilize markets during crises
- Reduce dependence on FX markets
- (For China) Internationalize the yuan

## Two competing networks

| | Fed USD network | PBOC yuan network |
|--|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Crisis liquidity | Trade + de-dollarization |
| **Size** | Unlimited (Big 5), ~$450B others | ~¥4.5T (~$630B) |
| **Active agreements** | 14 central banks | 32 central banks |
| **Usage** | Crisis-driven spikes | Low utilization |
| **Collateral** | Partner's currency | Partner's currency |
| **Political lens** | Allied democracies | Emerging markets, sanctioned states |

## Fed USD swap network

### Standing (permanent) lines

| Central bank | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Bank of Canada | Unlimited |
| Bank of England | Unlimited |
| Bank of Japan | Unlimited |
| European Central Bank | Unlimited |
| Swiss National Bank | Unlimited |

**"Big 5"** — Permanent, unlimited swaps. The inner circle of dollar liquidity.

### Temporary/other lines

Fed has extended temporary lines during crises to:
- Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden

### Usage pattern

| Period | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| Normal times | Near zero |
| 2008 GFC | $580B peak (ECB largest user) |
| 2011 Euro crisis | $100B+ |
| 2020 COVID | $450B peak (BoJ largest user) |
| 2023-2025 | Minimal |

**Key insight:** Swap lines are a backstop, not a primary funding source. Usage = crisis indicator.

### Political risk (2025)

Growing concern among foreign central bankers: Will post-Powell Fed maintain swap lines?

> "What if some future Fed leadership were to decline to extend its credit through central bank swaps?" — Robert McCauley, May 2025

**Stakes:** $18T in dollar liabilities held by non-US banks (60% of US GDP). If Fed swap lines become unreliable, entire global dollar system is at risk.

## PBOC yuan swap network

### Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total agreements | 40+ signed |
| Active agreements | 32 (as of mid-2025) |
| Total size | ~¥4.5T (~$630B) |
| Drawn down | ¥80.7B (~$11B) — **only 2% utilized** |

### Major agreements

| Partner | Size | Date |
|---------|------|------|
| ECB | ¥350B ($50B) | Renewed Sep 2025 |
| South Korea | ¥400B ($56B) | Renewed Nov 2025 |
| UK (BoE) | ¥350B | Active |
| Hong Kong | ¥800B | Largest |
| Switzerland | ¥150B | Renewed Sep 2025 |
| Hungary | ¥40B | Sep 2025 |
| Argentina | ¥130B | Activated 2023 |
| Saudi Arabia | — | 2024, size undisclosed |

### Countries with active swap lines (partial list)

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| Asia | Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan |
| Europe | ECB, UK, Switzerland, Hungary, Russia |
| Middle East | UAE, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt |
| Americas | Argentina, Brazil, Canada |
| Africa | South Africa, Nigeria |

### Low utilization problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Available | ¥4.5T+ |
| Actually drawn | ¥80.7B |
| Utilization | ~2% |

**Why so low:**
1. Yuan not freely convertible (capital controls)
2. Can only spend yuan in China or with Chinese counterparties
3. Most trade still invoiced in USD
4. Swap terms often unfavorable
5. Political strings attached

## Swap lines for sanctioned states

### Russia

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| PBOC swap size | ¥150B ($24B) |
| First activation | 2015 (post-Crimea sanctions) |
| RMB share of Russia-China trade | 3% (2014) → 17% (2020) → 40%+ (2024) |

**Pattern:** Russia drew on PBOC swap after 2014 sanctions, ramped up yuan usage after 2022 invasion.

**Limitations:** Can only use yuan for China trade. Russia still needs other currencies for non-China imports.

### Iran

| Mechanism | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Formal PBOC swap | Not public |
| Yuan settlement | Active since ~2012 |
| 25-year cooperation deal | Signed 2022, boosts RMB role |

**Iran's strategy (2021 Expediency Council report):**
1. Broker bilateral swap agreements
2. Join China-Russia financial messaging (CIPS, SPFS)
3. Use Chinese/Russian intermediaries to move funds globally

**Reality check:** Iran uses yuan for China oil trade but can't easily convert to other currencies. Yuan is a lifeline, not a solution.

### Argentina

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Swap activated | 2023 |
| Purpose | Pay IMF debt, cover imports |
| Size | ¥130B (~$18B) |

Argentina drew heavily on PBOC swap during 2023 crisis — used yuan to pay IMF and cover trade deficit. Example of swap as emergency financing for distressed countries.

## Why PBOC swaps aren't a sanctions shield

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Capital controls** | Can't freely convert yuan |
| **Spend only in China** | Limited use for non-China imports |
| **CIPS too small** | ~3% of SWIFT volume |
| **China uses SWIFT too** | Beijing won't undercut it |
| **Political dependence** | Trading USD master for yuan master |

**Atlantic Council assessment:** "On the whole, China's swaps-driven renminbi internationalization efforts have been underwhelming, and they're not the sanctions shield that they might appear."

## Other swap networks

### UAE — regional influence play

| Partner | Date |
|---------|------|
| Turkey | 2022 |
| Egypt | 2023 |
| Ethiopia | 2024 |

UAE using dirham swaps to build regional influence with distressed economies.

### India — rupee internationalization

India pushing rupee settlement with Russia, UAE, others. Limited progress.

## Investment implications

### What swap activity signals

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Fed swap usage spikes | Global dollar shortage, risk-off |
| PBOC swap activations | Partner in distress or de-dollarizing |
| New PBOC agreements | China expanding influence |
| Swap line political uncertainty | Dollar premium at risk |

### De-dollarization gauge

| Metric | Where to find |
|--------|---------------|
| Fed swap usage | FRED (SWPT series) |
| PBOC agreements | PBC.gov.cn |
| Yuan trade share | SWIFT RMB Tracker |
| CIPS volume | CIPS annual report |

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Fed swaps remain reliable | Dollar dominance continues |
| Fed swaps become political | Accelerates yuan adoption |
| China removes capital controls | Game-changer for yuan |
| CIPS scales up | SWIFT alternative viable |
