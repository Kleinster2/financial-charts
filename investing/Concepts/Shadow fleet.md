**Shadow fleet** — Tankers operating outside Western insurance and flagging systems to move sanctioned oil (Russia, [[Iran]], [[Venezuela]]). ~3,300 vessels globally, ~18% of world tanker tonnage.

---

## What is the shadow fleet

Old tankers with:
- Opaque ownership (shell companies)
- Non-Western insurance (Russian, offshore)
- Flags of convenience (Gabon, Cameroon, Palau)
- AIS transponders switched off or spoofed
- Ship-to-ship transfers to obscure origin

**Purpose:** Move sanctioned oil to buyers (mainly [[China]], [[India]]) while evading G7 price cap and sanctions.

## Scale

| Metric | Value (Dec 2025) |
|--------|------------------|
| Global shadow fleet | ~3,300 vessels |
| Russian shadow tankers | ~978 vessels |
| Share of world tanker tonnage | ~18.5% |
| Share of global crude flows | 6-7% |
| Falsely flagged ships | 450+ (doubled in 2025) |

---

## By country

### Russia

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Shadow tankers | ~978 |
| Share of Russian oil exports | ~27% via shadow fleet |
| Key routes | Baltic → [[India]], Pacific → [[China]] |

**Post-2022 buildup:** Russia rapidly assembled fleet after invasion to circumvent G7 price cap ($60/barrel).

### [[Iran]]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Export volume | 1.5-1.7M bbl/day (2025) |
| Destination | ~90% to [[China]] |
| Floating storage | 52M barrels (late 2025) |
| Method | Ship-to-ship near Malaysia, relabeled as "Malaysian" or "Indonesian" |

### [[Venezuela]]

Uses similar tactics, smaller scale. Often shares vessels with [[Iran]]/Russia networks.

## How it works

```
Sanctioned country loads tanker
    → Sails to international waters
        → AIS off or spoofed
            → Ship-to-ship transfer near Malaysia/Singapore
                → Cargo relabeled (fake origin certificate)
                    → Delivered to Chinese teapot refinery
                        → Payment via yuan, barter, or delayed USD
```

## [[Insurance]] and services

**Western system (blocked to shadow fleet):**
- P&I clubs (Protection & Indemnity insurance)
- Lloyd's of London
- International Group of P&I Clubs

**Shadow fleet alternatives:**

| Provider | Type |
|----------|------|
| Ingosstrakh (Russia) | [[Insurance]] — sanctioned Jan 2025 |
| Alfastrakhovanie (Russia) | [[Insurance]] — sanctioned Jan 2025 |
| Offshore shell insurers | Falsified certificates |
| Self-insurance | Uninsured voyages |

**Risk:** Aging tankers with dubious insurance = environmental disaster risk. Multiple near-misses in Baltic, Black Sea.

---

## Flags of convenience

| Flag | Status |
|------|--------|
| Panama | Deflagged ~70 shadow vessels |
| Barbados | Deflagged 46 Russian-linked ships (2025) |
| Liberia | Under pressure |
| Marshall Islands | Under pressure |
| **Gabon** | Rising as new option |
| Cameroon | Rising |
| Palau | Used by shadow fleet |

**Pattern:** As legitimate flag states crack down, shadow fleet moves to weaker registries.

## Sanctions enforcement (2025)

### January 2025 package

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| 183 vessels designated | Largest single wave |
| Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas | Major producers sanctioned |
| Ingosstrakh, Alfastrakhovanie | Russian insurers sanctioned |

### Ongoing enforcement

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jan 2025 | US sanctions 183 tankers + Russian insurers |
| Jul 2025 | [[UK]] sanctions 135 tankers |
| Dec 2025 | US sanctions 29 Iranian shadow vessels |
| Ongoing | Individual vessel designations |

### Physical interdiction

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jan 2, 2026 | Finland seized *Fitburg* |
| Jan 7, 2026 | US Navy seized *Marinera* |
| Nov 2025 | Ukraine drone strikes on *Virat*, *Kairos*, *Dashan* |

**Ukraine strikes:** SBU conducted drone attacks on shadow tankers in Black Sea. Trump administration reportedly approved, viewing it as pressure tool on Russia.

---

## Effectiveness of shadow fleet

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Russian oil exports | Largely maintained |
| Russian oil revenue | Modestly reduced |
| Price discount | Russia sells at $10-20 below Brent |
| Sanctions evasion | Partially successful |

**Key tension:** Shadow fleet keeps oil flowing but at lower prices and higher costs (old ships, risky insurance, complex logistics).

---

## Investment implications

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Oil prices** | Shadow fleet = more supply than sanctions intended |
| **Tanker rates** | Legitimate tankers benefit from reduced competition |
| **[[Insurance]]** | Western P&I clubs lose Russian/Iranian business |
| **Environmental risk** | Aging tankers = spill risk (Baltic, Singapore Strait) |
| **Shipyards** | Russia/[[China]] building new shadow-capable vessels |

### Stocks affected

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| Frontline, Euronav | Tanker rates |
| International Seaways | Tanker rates |
| P&I clubs | Lost premiums |
| Shipbuilders | Mixed |
