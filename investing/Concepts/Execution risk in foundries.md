Foundry execution risk = the probability that a fab fails to deliver promised capacity, yields, or timelines. The hardest thing in semiconductors is doing what you said you would do.

> **Key insight:** Execution risk isn't about technology — it's about organizational capability. The same process node can succeed or fail depending on who's running the fab.

## Sources of execution risk

| Risk source | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Process immaturity | New nodes have unstable yields | Samsung 3nm GAA early struggles |
| Geographic expansion | New sites lack institutional knowledge | TSMC Arizona ramp challenges |
| Midstream pivots | Changing plans mid-construction | [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] |
| Workforce gaps | Skilled labor takes years | US fab staffing difficulties |
| Supply chain | Equipment delays, chemical shortages | ASML delivery bottlenecks |
| Customer commitment | Chicken-and-egg with capacity | Intel Foundry waiting for wins |

## Who bears what level of risk

| Actor | Risk profile | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| [[TSMC]] | Low | Trades speed for predictability; see [[Why TSMC can afford patience]] |
| [[Samsung]] | High | Must accept risk for competitive positioning |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Very high | Unproven in external foundry, turnaround pressure |
| [[GlobalFoundries]] | Low-medium | Exited leading edge, specialty focus |
| SMIC | High | Operating under export controls |

## How execution risk manifests

**For foundries:**

| Manifestation | Financial impact |
|---------------|------------------|
| Yield problems | Higher cost per chip, margin compression |
| Ramp delays | Missed revenue, customer defection |
| Capex overruns | Balance sheet stress, ROI compression |
| Customer loss | Volume decline, utilization drop |
| Reputation damage | Premium erosion, multiple compression |

**For customers:**

| Manifestation | Business impact |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Supply uncertainty | Can't commit to product launches |
| Quality issues | Recalls, warranty costs |
| Dual-sourcing costs | Higher NRE, complexity |
| Product delays | Lost market share |

## Execution risk by project type

| Project type | Risk level | Examples |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| New node in existing fab | Medium | TSMC 2nm in Taiwan |
| New node in new geography | High | TSMC Arizona 2nm |
| Leapfrog node in new geography | Very high | Samsung Taylor 2nm |
| Greenfield fab, mature node | Medium-low | GlobalFoundries expansions |
| Process pivot mid-construction | Extreme | Samsung Taylor pivot |

## The execution gap

**Why some foundries execute better:**

| TSMC advantage | How it reduces risk |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Ecosystem density | Suppliers, talent in Hsinchu |
| Institutional memory | 30+ years of accumulated learning |
| Conservative culture | Won't overpromise |
| Customer concentration | Apple/NVIDIA ensure demand |
| Node sequencing | See [[Node lag as strategy]] |

**Why others struggle:**

| Samsung/Intel challenge | Risk driver |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Multiple business units | Foundry isn't sole focus |
| Geographic dispersion | Knowledge transfer difficult |
| Turnaround pressure | Forced to take risks |
| Customer chicken-and-egg | Need wins to prove, need proof to win |

## Investor lens

**Execution risk shows up as:**
- Earnings volatility (missed quarters)
- Capex write-downs (failed projects)
- Customer defection (design wins → losses)
- Multiple compression (market loses trust)
- Management turnover (accountability)

**Warning signs:**
- Repeated timeline slips
- Yield commentary absent from calls
- Key customer losses
- Capex guidance cuts
- Executive departures

## How to assess execution risk

| Factor | Low risk signal | High risk signal |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Track record | Met prior commitments | History of misses |
| Customer commentary | Praise, expanding orders | Silence, hedging |
| Talent | Stable, experienced | Turnover, hiring struggles |
| Capex | Disciplined, ROI-focused | Aggressive, unclear returns |
| Communication | Transparent, conservative | Vague, promotional |
