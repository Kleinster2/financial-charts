Foundry execution risk = the probability that a fab fails to deliver promised capacity, yields, or timelines.

## Sources of execution risk

- **Process immaturity**: New nodes have unstable yields
- **Geographic expansion**: New sites lack institutional knowledge
- **Midstream pivots**: Changing plans mid-construction (see [[Samsung Taylor pivot]])
- **Workforce gaps**: Skilled labor takes years to develop
- **Supply chain**: Equipment delays, chemical shortages

## Who bears it

| Actor | Execution risk profile |
|-------|------------------------|
| [[TSMC]] | Low — trades speed for predictability |
| [[Samsung]] | High — accepts risk for competitive positioning |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Very high — unproven in external foundry |

## Investor lens

Execution risk shows up as:
- Earnings volatility
- Capex write-downs
- Customer defection
- Multiple compression
