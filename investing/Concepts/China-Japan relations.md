**China-Japan relations** — Geopolitical rivalry between Asia's two largest economies. Escalating in Jan 2026 over Taiwan comments.

---

## Current status (Jan 2026)

**Major escalation.** Neither side can back down without losing face.

### Trigger

PM Sanae Takaichi said in parliament that a Taiwan "contingency" could threaten Japan's security and necessitate military response. Beijing views this as interference in "domestic issue."

### China retaliation

| Action | Date | Details |
|--------|------|---------|
| Export ban | Jan 2026 | Dual-use equipment: sensors, semiconductors, batteries, chemicals, rare earths |
| Anti-dumping probe | Jan 2026 | Dichlorosilane (chip manufacturing chemical) — claims 31% price drop since 2022 |
| Business delegation | Canceled | Japanese leaders' visit scrapped |
| Tourism pressure | Ongoing | Travel agencies told to cancel Japan trips |
| Military posturing | Dec 2025 | Radar lock on Japanese jets; Taiwan blockade exercises |

### Japan response

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Official protest | "Absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable" |
| Takaichi stance | "Open to dialogue" but not retracting Taiwan comments |
| Defense budget | Record 9T yen ($57.4B), +3.8% |

## Analysis

### Who has the upper hand?

**China.** Professor Shigemura (Waseda): "China can exert a lot of pressure on Japanese companies, which are quite quickly going to find themselves in a difficult situation."

### Political, not trade

"This is not a trade issue for China; it is a political issue. Beijing sees Takaichi as being too conservative and they want her out of office." — Shigemura

### No off-ramp

"The chances of either side de-escalating the situation at the moment appear quite low because neither wants to lose face." — Ben Ascione (Waseda)

### Regional dynamics

Xi attempted to recruit South Korean President Lee Jae Myung for anti-Japan alliance during China visit. Lee was non-committal. South Korea watching with concern (still under THAAD-related cultural ban since 2017).

## Flashpoints

| Flashpoint | Risk |
|------------|------|
| **Taiwan contingency** | Japan could be drawn into US-China conflict |
| **Senkaku/Diaoyu** | Maritime incidents, island landing risk |
| **Military exercises** | Radar locks, close encounters |
| **Economic coercion** | Rare earths, tourism, trade restrictions |
