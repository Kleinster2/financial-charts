**China-Japan relations** — Geopolitical rivalry between Asia's two largest economies. Escalating in Jan 2026 over Taiwan comments.

---

## Current status (Jan 2026)

**Major escalation.** Neither side can back down without losing face.

### Trigger

PM Sanae Takaichi said in parliament that a Taiwan "contingency" could threaten Japan's security and necessitate military response. Beijing views this as interference in "domestic issue."

### China retaliation

| Action | Date | Details |
|--------|------|---------|
| Export ban | Jan 2026 | Dual-use equipment: sensors, semiconductors, batteries, chemicals, rare earths |
| Anti-dumping probe | Jan 2026 | Dichlorosilane (chip manufacturing chemical) — claims 31% price drop since 2022 |
| Business delegation | Canceled | Japanese leaders' visit scrapped |
| Tourism pressure | Ongoing | Travel agencies told to cancel Japan trips |
| Military posturing | Dec 2025 | Radar lock on Japanese jets; Taiwan blockade exercises |

### Japan response

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Official protest | "Absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable" |
| Takaichi stance | "Open to dialogue" but not retracting Taiwan comments |
| Defense budget | Record 9T yen ($57.4B), +3.8% |

**Allied outreach (Jan 2026):**

| Meeting | Parties | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Finance Minister Katayama | G7 counterparts (US trip) | Critical minerals discussion |
| Defense Minister Koizumi | US counterpart | Security coordination |
| PM Takaichi | South Korea's Lee Jae Myung (Jan 21-22) | Reaffirm alliance |
| PM Takaichi | Italy's Meloni (Jan 15-17) | G7 solidarity |

**Katayama:** "Fundamental consensus among G-7 nations is that it is unacceptable for countries to secure monopolies through non-market means. This poses a crisis for the global economy."

**Kihara (Chief Cabinet Secretary):** "China's export control measures on rare earths and other materials have been ongoing for some time and are having a serious impact on the global supply chain."

### Supply chain impact

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Neodymium magnet lead times | **3-4 months** (from usual 1-2) |
| Customs processing | Lengthened since end of 2025 |
| Inventory response | Japanese firms securing 6+ months |
| Overall status | Export applications still processing, but slower |

## Japan's response options

**Overall stance:** Cautious. Limited options, no appetite to escalate with largest trading partner.

### Option 1: Turn to US
- Trump offered Takaichi "anything"
- Takaichi visit to Washington possibly **as early as March**
- Joint pressure on China or deeper critical minerals cooperation

### Option 2: Exert pain on China
**Japan's leverage:**

| Sector | Japan market share |
|--------|-------------------|
| Advanced photoresist | **~90%** |
| Semiconductor packaging materials | **~90%** |

Curbing exports would hit China's chip self-sufficiency ambitions — especially if coordinated with US and Netherlands.

**Risk:** Would provoke Beijing retaliation; China has "far greater capacity to absorb and deploy economic pressure."

### Option 3: Coordinate on rare earths
Rally countries facing similar risks. Japan diversified since 2010:
- Backed [[Lynas]] (now biggest non-China mined supply)
- Recycling programs
- Built strategic stockpiles

### Option 4: Diplomatic channels
G7, UN — easy sell since other members share critical minerals concerns.

## Trade imbalance

**Japan relies far more on China:**

| Metric | Japan to China | China to Japan |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Export share | 6.3% of China imports | 4% of China exports |
| Key goods | Machinery, electronics (52%) | Critical minerals |

Japan = China's 2nd largest market, 3rd largest import source.

## Analysis

### Who has the upper hand?

**China.** Professor Shigemura (Waseda): "China can exert a lot of pressure on Japanese companies, which are quite quickly going to find themselves in a difficult situation."

### Political, not trade

"This is not a trade issue for China; it is a political issue. Beijing sees Takaichi as being too conservative and they want her out of office." — Shigemura

### No off-ramp

"The chances of either side de-escalating the situation at the moment appear quite low because neither wants to lose face." — Ben Ascione (Waseda)

### Regional dynamics

Xi attempted to recruit South Korean President Lee Jae Myung for anti-Japan alliance during China visit. Lee was non-committal. South Korea watching with concern (still under THAAD-related cultural ban since 2017).

## Historical context

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| WWII history | Unresolved resentments, textbook disputes |
| Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands | Both claim sovereignty |
| Taiwan | Japan sees as security issue; China sees as domestic |
| Trade | Deep interdependence despite tensions |

---

## Flashpoints

| Flashpoint | Risk |
|------------|------|
| **Taiwan contingency** | Japan could be drawn into US-China conflict |
| **Senkaku/Diaoyu** | Maritime incidents, island landing risk |
| **Military exercises** | Radar locks, close encounters |
| **Economic coercion** | Rare earths, tourism, trade restrictions |

## Investment implications

### Japan exposure to China pressure

| Sector | Vulnerability |
|--------|---------------|
| Electronics | Rare earth dependence |
| Autos | China market, supply chains |
| Tourism | Chinese visitors significant |
| Semiconductors | Equipment exports, materials |

### Beneficiaries of tension

| Play | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Japanese defense stocks | MHI, Kawasaki Heavy — budget increase |
| Non-China rare earths | MP Materials, Lynas |
| Japan semiconductor equipment | Decoupling beneficiary if localization |

### Losers

| Play | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Japan tourism | Chinese visitor decline |
| China-exposed Japanese firms | Sony (gaming), auto JVs |

## Signposts to watch

| Signal | De-escalation | Escalation |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Takaichi | Softens Taiwan language | Doubles down |
| China export controls | Lifted | Expanded to rare earths fully |
| Diplomatic contact | Resumed | Frozen |
| Military | Reduced exercises | Incidents |
| Xi-Japan | Dialogue overture | Continued pressure |
