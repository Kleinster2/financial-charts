# IFRS

International Financial Reporting Standards — the global accounting framework used in 140+ jurisdictions (not the US, which uses GAAP). Set by the IFRS Foundation / International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in London.

## IFRS 10: Consolidation

The standard most relevant to investing analysis. IFRS 10 requires a parent to consolidate a subsidiary when it has **control** — defined as:

1. Power over the investee (voting rights or contractual arrangements)
2. Exposure to variable returns
3. Ability to use power to affect returns

The critical threshold is typically >50% voting rights, though control can exist below 50% (de facto control) or not exist above 50% (if power is shared via a shareholders' agreement).

### Why it matters

When consolidation is triggered, the subsidiary's entire balance sheet (all assets, all liabilities) gets absorbed line-by-line into the parent's financials. This can dramatically change leverage ratios, debt covenants, and credit metrics overnight — without any change in the underlying business.

### Raizen example

[[Shell]] holds 44% of [[Raizen]]. If Shell injected enough capital to cross 50%, IFRS 10 would require Shell to consolidate [[Raizen]]'s R$76.8B gross debt ($14.3B) onto its own balance sheet. This is a key reason Shell refuses to increase its stake — the accounting consequence outweighs the strategic benefit. See [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]].

| Leases | IFRS 16 (all on balance sheet) | ASC 842 (similar post-2019) |
| Consolidation | IFRS 10 (control model) | ASC 810 (variable interest entity model) |
