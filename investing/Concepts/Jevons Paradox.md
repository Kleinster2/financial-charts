**Jevons Paradox** — Efficiency improvements in resource use increase total consumption, not decrease it. Named after William Stanley Jevons (1865) who observed coal consumption rose as steam engines became more efficient.

> **Key insight:** When something gets cheaper/more efficient, demand doesn't stay flat — it explodes. This is the core counter-argument to "efficiency will reduce GPU demand."

## The paradox explained

| Intuition | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| More efficient → less demand | More efficient → lower cost → more use cases → more demand |

**Historical examples:**

| Technology | Efficiency gain | Consumption outcome |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Steam engines | 3x efficiency | Coal use increased 10x |
| LED lighting | 80% less power | Lighting usage exploded |
| Cloud compute | 90% cost reduction | Compute usage 100x |
| Air travel | Cheaper per mile | Total miles flown soared |
| Storage | $/GB dropped 1000x | Data storage exploded |

## Application to AI compute

**The DeepSeek day debate:**

| Bear case (efficiency reduces demand) | Bull case (Jevons Paradox) |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Better algorithms → fewer GPUs needed | Cheaper inference → more AI deployed |
| MoE reduces compute per query | Lower cost → new use cases emerge |
| China proves efficiency can substitute | Total compute demand still grows |

**The resolution:** Both can be true. Compute per task falls, but number of tasks grows faster.

## Why Jevons applies to AI

| Factor | Why it increases demand |
|--------|------------------------|
| Price elasticity | Demand is elastic — cheaper = much more usage |
| Latent demand | Millions of use cases waiting for lower costs |
| Enterprise deployment | Companies deploy more AI when ROI improves |
| Consumer products | More AI features when inference is cheap |
| Agentic workloads | Agents run 100x more queries than humans |

---

## Counterargument: When Jevons doesn't apply

| Condition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Inelastic demand | Medical procedures (need-based, not price-driven) |
| Saturated market | Refrigerators (everyone already has one) |
| Regulatory limits | Carbon emissions (capped by policy) |

**Does AI fit these exceptions?** No. AI demand is highly elastic, market is unsaturated, no hard caps.

## Investment implications

**For [[Long NVIDIA]]:**
- Efficiency gains are real but don't kill the thesis
- Cheaper inference = more inference = more GPUs (eventually)
- Watch for demand elasticity evidence

**For [[DeepSeek day]] interpretation:**
- Market panicked about efficiency killing demand
- Jevons Paradox suggests panic was overdone
- Recovery confirmed this interpretation

**The key metric:** Total AI compute consumed, not compute per query.
