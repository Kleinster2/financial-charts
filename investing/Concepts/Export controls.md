U.S.-led restrictions on semiconductor technology exports to [[China]]. Central constraint shaping industry capex, supply chains, and geopolitical risk.

## Current regime (Dec 2025)

| Rule | Status | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **VEU (Validated End User)** | Revoked Dec 31, 2025 | TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs need case-by-case approval |
| **H200 exports** | Conditional | Allowed if 25% revenue goes to US govt |
| **H20 exports** | Banned then unbanned | Multiple reversals throughout 2025 |
| **Affiliate Rule** | Suspended 1 year | Exchange for China suspending rare earth controls |
| **EUV equipment** | Fully banned | No [[ASML]] EUV to China |
| **DUV equipment** | Restricted | Older tools still flowing, subsystem upgrades happening |
| **Section 301 tariffs** | 0% now → June 2027 | On top of existing 50% tariffs |

---

## Key mechanisms

### Entity List
- Restricts exports to specific Chinese companies ([[Huawei]], SMIC, etc.)
- Requires license for controlled items
- De facto ban for leading-edge

### Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR)
- Extraterritorial reach: items made with US tools/IP anywhere in world
- Forces non-US companies to comply
- [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], [[ASML]] all affected

### Validated End User (VEU)
- Expedited licensing for trusted fabs
- Revoked Dec 31, 2025 for Korea/Taiwan fabs in China
- Now case-by-case approval required (1-year terms, no expansion)

---

## Allied coordination

| Country | Stance |
|---------|--------|
| **Netherlands** | ASML EUV banned, DUV restricted |
| **Japan** | Tokyo Electron, Nikon restricted |
| **South Korea** | Caught in middle — fabs in China, US pressure |
| **Taiwan** | [[N-2 rule]] under consideration (2 generations behind for overseas) |

**Congress finding (Dec 2025)**: Despite restrictions, China remains largest market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Companies "profiting at expense of U.S. national security."

---

## Economic impact

**ITIF estimates** (full decoupling scenario):
- $77B US sales loss
- 24% R&D spending cut
- Accelerates China indigenous development

**Company exposure**:
| Company | China revenue at risk |
|---------|----------------------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Was ~25%, mostly lost |
| Qualcomm | ~60% |
| Applied Materials | Significant |
| Lam Research | Significant |
| [[ASML]] | DUV ongoing |

---

## Policy uncertainty

2025 saw multiple reversals:
- H20 banned → unbanned → restricted
- H200 banned → conditional approval
- Affiliate Rule → suspended
- VEU → revoked

**Implication**: Companies cannot plan long-term. Capex decisions complicated by regulatory whiplash.

---

## Impact by segment

### Memory (Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs)
- VEU revoked — no more blanket authorization
- New policy: 1-year approvals (can operate, can't expand/upgrade)
- Effect: Caps China memory supply, supports DRAM/NAND pricing
- SK Hynix: 30-35% DRAM, 40-45% NAND from China

### Foundry (TSMC, etc.)
- N-2 rule — Taiwan restricts TSMC from leading edge overseas
- U.S. fabs subject to tighter export/customer restrictions
- China fabs (SMIC) cut off from advanced equipment (EUV)

---

## Who benefits

| Player | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | China fabs constrained but pricing power improves |
| [[Samsung]] | Same — memory margins benefit from supply cap |
| U.S. memory buyers | Pay higher prices (the policy tradeoff) |

---

## Who loses

| Player | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Chinese fabs | Can't access advanced equipment |
| Consumers | Higher memory prices |
| Samsung/SK Hynix expansion | Can't grow China capacity |

---

## AI chips: Tiered release strategy

[[NVIDIA]] H200 exports to China resuming — but this is strategic, not relaxation:

**The calculus:**
- H200 is "previous gen" — B200 (Blackwell) is 3.1x faster
- Rubin (2026) widens gap further
- Release old tech while monopolizing cutting edge
- Ecosystem defense against Chinese chip makers

**NVIDIA China share:** 95% → ~0% under tight controls, could recover 10-25% with H200

**Performance gap persists:**
- Huawei 910C: 76% of H200 compute, 2/3 memory bandwidth
- Cambricon, Hygon even further behind
- Even "outdated" H200 beats all Chinese alternatives

**Dual ecosystem forming:**
- Training: NVIDIA (high barriers, price premium acceptable)
- Inference: Chinese chips (cost sensitive, high volume)

**China's response:** ASIC differentiation, full-stack ecosystem (hardware → software → models). TSMC access restricted, SMIC yield issues remain bottlenecks.

## Strategic implications

- Memory supply structurally constrained → supports Korean company margins
- Higher profits fund other bets ([[Advanced packaging]], foundry)
- U.S. policy inadvertently strengthens Korean balance sheets
- Creates incentive to build capacity outside China (U.S., Korea)
- AI chip tiering maintains US dominance while allowing managed competition

---

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

Bullish Korea:
- Supply constraint = pricing power
- Memory profits fund packaging/foundry expansion
- Policy tailwind, not headwind

## What to watch

- [ ] VEU case-by-case approval patterns (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Congress push for stricter allied coordination
- [ ] Rare earth control escalation risk
- [ ] H200 uptake under 25% revenue rule
- [ ] CHIPS Act guardrails enforcement
