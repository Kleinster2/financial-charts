U.S.-led restrictions on semiconductor technology exports to [[China]]. Central constraint shaping industry capex, supply chains, and geopolitical risk.

---

## Current regime (Dec 2025)

| Rule | Status | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **VEU (Validated End User)** | Revoked Dec 31, 2025 | TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs need case-by-case approval |
| **H200 exports** | **Managed access (Jan 14)** | 25% Section 232 tariff + ≤50% of US volume + verification |
| **H20 exports** | Banned then unbanned | Multiple reversals throughout 2025 |
| **Affiliate Rule** | Suspended 1 year | Exchange for China suspending rare earth controls |
| **EUV equipment** | Fully banned | No [[ASML]] EUV to China |
| **DUV equipment** | Restricted | Older tools still flowing, subsystem upgrades happening |
| **Section 232 tariff** | **25% (Jan 15, 2026)** | Advanced AI chips; escalation to 100%/legacy chips possible |
| **Section 301 tariffs** | 0% now → June 2027 | On top of existing 50% tariffs |

---

## China's counter-move: 50% domestic mandate (Dec 2025)

**The rule:** Chipmakers must use at least 50% domestically-made equipment for new capacity.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Enforcement | State approval for fab builds/expansions |
| Threshold | 50% minimum, authorities prefer higher |
| Exceptions | Advanced nodes (temporary, lithography gap) |
| Long-term goal | 100% domestic equipment |
| Verification | Procurement tenders reviewed |

**Impact on Western WFE:**
- [[ASML]], [[Applied Materials]], [[Lam Research]], [[KLA]] squeezed from both sides
- Export controls block sales + demand-side mandate blocks purchases
- China was largest equipment market — now closing

**China equipment winners:**
| Company | Segment | 2025 Performance |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| [[Naura Technology]] | Etch, deposition, cleaning | Revenue +30% H1, 779 patents filed |
| [[AMEC]] | Etch | Revenue +44% H1 |
| Domestic lithography | Exposure | 421 orders, 850M yuan |

**Self-sufficiency progress:**
- ~50% in cleaning/photoresist removal (was Japanese-dominated)
- Lithography still major gap (no EUV capability)
- Etch and deposition catching up

> "Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment. But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers."

---

## Key mechanisms

### Entity List
- Restricts exports to specific Chinese companies ([[Huawei]], SMIC, etc.)
- Requires license for controlled items
- De facto ban for leading-edge

### Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR)
- Extraterritorial reach: items made with US tools/IP anywhere in world
- Forces non-US companies to comply
- [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], [[ASML]] all affected

### Validated End User (VEU)
- Expedited licensing for trusted fabs
- Revoked Dec 31, 2025 for Korea/[[Taiwan]] fabs in China
- Now case-by-case approval required (1-year terms, no expansion)

---

## Allied coordination

| Country | Stance |
|---------|--------|
| **Netherlands** | ASML EUV banned, DUV restricted |
| **[[Japan]]** | [[Tokyo Electron]], Nikon restricted |
| **South Korea** | Caught in middle — fabs in China, US pressure |
| **[[Taiwan]]** | [[N-2 rule]] under consideration (2 generations behind for overseas) |

**Congress finding (Dec 2025)**: Despite restrictions, China remains largest market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Companies "profiting at expense of U.S. national security."

---

## Economic impact

**ITIF estimates** (full decoupling scenario):
- $77B US sales loss
- 24% R&D spending cut
- Accelerates China indigenous development

**Company exposure**:
| Company | China revenue at risk |
|---------|----------------------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Was ~25%, mostly lost |
| [[Qualcomm]] | ~60% |
| Applied Materials | Significant |
| Lam Research | Significant |
| [[ASML]] | DUV ongoing |

---

## Policy uncertainty

2025-26 saw multiple reversals:
- H20 banned → unbanned → restricted
- H200 banned → conditional approval → **Jan 2026 framework**
- Affiliate Rule → suspended
- VEU → revoked

### Jan 2026: H200 framework details

Commerce Department eased stance from "presumed denial" to case-by-case review:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Review process | Case-by-case (eased from presumed denial) |
| US shortage certification | Must certify no domestic shortage |
| **China volume cap** | **≤50% of US market production** |
| 25% revenue share | To US government |
| Applies to | NVIDIA H200, [[AMD]] chips |

**China response:** Global Times dismissed as "discriminatory" — "not applied to other US trading partners but targeted specifically at China."

**Bloomberg Intelligence (Michael Deng):** "Calibrated attempt" at maintaining US capability advantage. Combined requirements "may be overly burdensome" and "could be undermined further by opposition from Congress and Beijing."

### Jan 14, 2026: China blocks H200

Despite US easing stance, China responded by effectively blocking imports:

| Development | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Customs directive | Chinese customs told agents H200 chips "not permitted" |
| Company meetings | Tech firms summoned, told not to purchase "unless necessary" |
| Exceptions | "Special circumstances" only — university R&D labs |
| Source quote | "Wording so severe that it is basically a ban for now" |

**Strategic logic:** Beijing needs domestic chip demand to fund Huawei [[Ascend]] development. Even when US allows exports, China may block imports to protect domestic industry.

**Implication**: Companies cannot plan long-term. Capex decisions complicated by regulatory whiplash.

### Jan 14-15, 2026: Section 232 semiconductor tariff — new policy tool

**The biggest shift since export controls began.** See [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]] for full details.

The US moved from **pure restriction** to **controlled access + monetization**:

| Era | Approach | Revenue | China access |
|-----|----------|---------|----|
| Biden (2022-2024) | Pure restriction | $0 | Blocked |
| **Trump 2.0 (Jan 2026)** | **Tariff + managed access** | **$4-6B/yr** | Reopened (capped) |

**Key mechanics:**
- 25% tariff on advanced AI chips (H200, MI325X) under Section 232
- NVIDIA China sales reopened under "managed access" (≤50% of US volume)
- $250B TSMC deal: preferential treatment tied to US fab investment
- US data centers, R&D, startups **exempted** — tariff hits re-exports

**Escalation roadmap:**

| Phase | Timeline | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Jan 2026 | 25% on advanced AI chips |
| Phase 2 | If milestones missed | → 100% |
| **Phase 3** | **Jun 2027** | **Legacy/mature-node chips** |

**Phase 3 significance:** All semiconductor imports eventually tariffed. [[Automotive]], medical devices get "glide path" to domestic sourcing.

**Why this matters for export controls:** Section 232 adds a **fiscal incentive** to maintain controlled access — the government earns revenue from managed chip trade. Pure restriction generated $0. This changes the political economy of controls.

## Impact by segment

### Memory (Samsung, SK Hynix China fabs)
- VEU revoked — no more blanket authorization
- New policy: 1-year approvals (can operate, can't expand/upgrade)
- Effect: Caps China memory supply, supports DRAM/NAND pricing
- SK Hynix: 30-35% DRAM, 40-45% NAND from China

### Foundry (TSMC, etc.)
- N-2 rule — [[Taiwan]] restricts TSMC from leading edge overseas
- U.S. fabs subject to tighter export/customer restrictions
- China fabs (SMIC) cut off from advanced equipment (EUV)

### WFE (equipment makers)
- Export controls block supply
- China 50% mandate blocks demand
- Double squeeze on Western WFE China revenue
- Benefits [[Naura Technology]], [[AMEC]]

---

## Who benefits

| Player | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | China fabs constrained but pricing power improves |
| [[Samsung]] | Same — memory margins benefit from supply cap |
| [[Naura Technology]] | China domestic mandate = captive market |
| [[AMEC]] | Same — etch market share gains |
| U.S. memory buyers | Pay higher prices (the policy tradeoff) |

---

## Who loses

| Player | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Chinese fabs | Can't access advanced equipment |
| [[Applied Materials]], [[Lam Research]], [[KLA]] | Losing China market both ways |
| [[ASML]] | EUV blocked, DUV shrinking |
| Consumers | Higher memory prices |
| Samsung/SK Hynix expansion | Can't grow China capacity |

---

## SEA diversion route

Despite controls, chips may be reaching China through [[Southeast Asia]]. See [[SEA chip diversion]] for full analysis.

**[[Taiwan]] → SEA chip exports (Jan-Oct 2025):**

| Country | Imports | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Malaysia | $12B | Largest corridor |
| Singapore | $7B | Removed from NVIDIA geographic reporting |
| Thailand | $3B | Growing |
| Indonesia | $1.2B | Growing |
| **Total** | **$23B** | 17.5% of NVIDIA DC revenue |

**Enforcement gap:**
- Jensen claims "no diversion found" after sampling DCs
- US District Court (N.D. Cal) charged individuals for GPU smuggling (Jan 2026)
- NVIDIA changed geographic reporting definition twice in <1 year

**Post-DeepSeek shift:**
Chinese tech firms now building DCs directly in SEA instead of smuggling to mainland:
- Dozens of Chinese-built DCs across Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia
- Chips stay "in SEA" technically — not classified as diversion
- SEA governments welcome investment regardless of end use

**Implication:** Export controls may be less effective than assumed. SEA = major leakage route.

---

## AI chips: Tiered release strategy

[[NVIDIA]] H200 exports to China resuming — but this is strategic, not relaxation:

**The calculus:**
- H200 is "previous gen" — B200 (Blackwell) is 3.1x faster
- Rubin (2026) widens gap further
- Release old tech while monopolizing cutting edge
- Ecosystem defense against Chinese chip makers

**NVIDIA China share:** 95% → ~0% under tight controls, could recover 10-25% with H200

**Performance gap persists:**
- Huawei 910C: 76% of H200 compute, 2/3 memory bandwidth
- Cambricon, Hygon even further behind
- Even "outdated" H200 beats all Chinese alternatives

**Dual ecosystem forming:**
- Training: NVIDIA (high barriers, price premium acceptable)
- Inference: Chinese chips (cost sensitive, high volume)

**China's response:** ASIC differentiation, full-stack ecosystem (hardware → software → models). TSMC access restricted, SMIC yield issues remain bottlenecks.

## China's countermeasures

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for the full pattern.

| Category | 2024-2025 Actions |
|----------|-------------------|
| **[[Critical minerals]]** | Banned Ga/Ge/Sb sales to US (Dec 2024) |
| **Rare earths** | 7 REEs restricted (Apr 2025), 5 more added (Oct 2025) |
| **FDPR adoption** | China now uses extraterritorial controls too (Oct 2025) |
| **Military denial** | All military-affiliated buyers blocked (Dec 2025) |
| **Equipment mandate** | 50% domestic equipment requirement |
| **Targeted retaliation** | [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] response |
| **Chip subsidy package** | **$70B** under consideration (Jan 2026) |
| **H200 import block** | Customs told to block H200 imports (Jan 2026) |
| **[[Cybersecurity]] ban** | US/Israeli security software banned (Jan 2026) |

**Key escalation**: China adopted the FDPR mechanism — products made outside China require licenses if they contain Chinese-origin materials. See [[Rare earth leverage]].

**Quid pro quo**: Affiliate Rule suspended 1 year in exchange for China suspending rare earth controls (Nov 2025). Pause, not resolution.

## US AI Action Plan (July 2025)

Trump administration response to China AI competition:

| Policy | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Red tape cuts | Expedited permits for data centers |
| Power access | New energy sources for AI DCs |
| Open source | Encouraged as "geostrategic value" |
| State preemption | Threaten to withhold funds from states with burdensome AI rules |

**Trump:** "The US will do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence."

**[[OpenAI]] response (Aug 2025):** Released pair of open models — first major open-source move. Lobbying for fair use access to copyrighted training data.

> "If China's developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access, the race for AI is effectively over." — [[OpenAI]]

**Xi Jinping counter:** "AI should not be a game of rich countries."

## American AI Export Program (Jan 2026 update)

**The offensive counterpart to export controls.** While controls restrict China, the export program proliferates American tech globally. ([[Michael Kratsios]], [[David Sacks]], Davos Jan 23 2026)

### Winning metric

**Sacks:** "If in 5 years we look around the world and it's American chips and models being used everywhere, we won. If it's Huawei chips and DeepSeek models, we lost."

### Program mechanics

| Stage | Status (Jan 2026) |
|-------|-------------------|
| RFI (Request for Information) | **Closed** (late 2025) — Commerce ingesting industry input |
| RFP (Request for Proposals) | **"Very shortly"** — companies form consortia |
| Deployment | Partnering with DFC + Ex-Im Bank |
| Next milestone | **[[India AI]] Impact Summit** (Feb 2026) — more details |

### Design philosophy

**Key insight (Kratsios):** Buyers worldwide vary dramatically in sophistication.

| Buyer type | Needs |
|------------|-------|
| US Fortune 500 | Sophisticated — evaluate clouds, models, fine-tuning, custom apps |
| Most countries | "Just trying to figure out a tool for healthcare or tax collection" |

**Solution:** "Turnkey" AI packages — manageably-sized, easy to deploy.

- Most countries do NOT have capital or aspiration for large-scale training runs
- Very few will build "colossus-style training centers"
- Most need smaller data centers with **inference-related chips only**
- Packages = American models + American chips + deployment support

### Financing

| Organization | Role |
|--------------|------|
| **Development Finance Corporation (DFC)** | Export financing |
| **Export-Import Bank** | Make packages "commercially viable" in developing countries |

### The Huawei parallel

**Kratsios (first-hand from Trump I):** Huawei wasn't the best telecom technology but was "good enough" and "subsidized enough" to become default for much of the world. China now has same ambition with AI models — export across global south.

**US advantage:** Dominant in every part of the stack (models, chips, applications). Unlike telecom era, starting from position of strength. Goal: every developer worldwide fine-tunes American model on American chip.

### Ecosystem framing

**Sacks:** Great tech companies create ecosystems — most apps in app store, most developers on API, platform companies. "Biggest ecosystem wins." Need partner mindset: create value for partners, let every country derive value from AI revolution even if they don't build frontier models.

## Strategic implications

- Memory supply structurally constrained → supports Korean company margins
- Higher profits fund other bets ([[Advanced packaging]], foundry)
- U.S. policy inadvertently strengthens Korean balance sheets
- Creates incentive to build capacity outside China (U.S., Korea)
- AI chip tiering maintains US dominance while allowing managed competition
- China domestic mandate accelerates indigenous equipment development

---

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

Bullish Korea:
- Supply constraint = pricing power
- Memory profits fund packaging/foundry expansion
- Policy tailwind, not headwind

---

## For [[Long WFE]] thesis

Mixed:
- China 50% mandate = structural China revenue loss
- But: non-China capacity buildout continues
- Net effect depends on how much non-China demand offsets

---
