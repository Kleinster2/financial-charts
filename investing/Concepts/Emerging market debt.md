## Hard currency vs local currency

| Type | Currency | Risk | Vehicles |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **Hard currency** | USD-denominated | Default + US rates | EMB, VWOB |
| **Local currency** | EM currencies | Default + FX + local rates | EMLC, LEMB |

EMB = hard currency (USD). No direct FX risk but sensitive to dollar strength.

---

## Key drivers

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **US dollar** | Strong USD = EM stress (dollar debt harder to service) |
| **US rates** | Higher = competition for flows, pressure on EM |
| **Commodity prices** | Many EM are commodity exporters |
| **Global risk appetite** | Risk-on = EM inflows, risk-off = outflows |
| **China** | Largest EM, affects sentiment |
| **Country-specific** | Politics, defaults, IMF programs |

## Default risk

EM sovereigns can and do default:

| Recent defaults | Year |
|-----------------|------|
| [[Argentina]] | 2020 |
| Lebanon | 2020 |
| Sri Lanka | 2022 |
| Ghana | 2022 |
| Zambia | 2020 |

EMB diversified across ~30+ countries, limiting single-name risk.

## EM spread history

| Period | EM spread | Context |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 2007 (pre-GFC) | ~150bp | Tight |
| 2008-09 (GFC) | ~800bp | Crisis |
| 2013 (Taper Tantrum) | ~350bp | Fed scare |
| 2020 (COVID) | ~700bp | Crisis |
| 2022-23 | ~400-500bp | Rate hikes |
| 2025-26 | ~350bp | Normalizing |

---

## Dollar sensitivity

EM debt highly sensitive to USD:
- EM countries borrow in USD
- Strong dollar = higher debt burden
- Dollar weakness = EM relief

**2025 theme:** USD weakness supported EM debt returns.

## Country spotlight: India

[[India]] represents a key EM local currency market. FY2026 budget (Feb 2026) announced record borrowing:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross borrowing | ₹17.2T ($187B), +18% YoY |
| Fiscal deficit | 4.3% of GDP |
| 10Y yield | 6.73%, could push to 7% |

Pressure from supply (record issuance + state borrowing) and weak demand (pension funds, RBI FX interventions draining liquidity). See [[India FY2026 budget]].
