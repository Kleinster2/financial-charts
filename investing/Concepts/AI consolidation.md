# AI Consolidation

Big Tech acquiring AI startups through stealth deals (acqui-hires, licensing) to dodge antitrust. 2026 expected to see "Darwinian thinning" of ~40K AI startups.

## Author's thesis (Parmy Olson, Jan 7, 2026)

Big Tech will use two strategies to consolidate AI:

1. **Acqui-hires** — licensing + hiring deals that avoid triggering antitrust review
2. **Chinese acquisitions** — buying Chinese startups (avoiding outbound investment rules)

Result: Big Tech entrenches dominance, picks up talent and IP while startups struggle.

**Key quote:** "There's sadly little chance that any of them — even large ones like OpenAI and Anthropic — will unseat the so-called Magnificent Seven."

## Major acqui-hires / stealth acquisitions

| Date | Acquirer | Target | Value | Structure |
|------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Dec 2025 | [[NVIDIA]] | [[Groq]] | $20B | Licensing (backdoor) |
| Dec 2025 | [[Meta]] | Manus | $2B | Outright (Chinese startup) |
| 2025 | [[Google]] | Windsurf | $2.4B | Assets + talent |
| 2024 | [[Google]] | [[Character.AI]] | $2.7B | Acqui-hire |
| 2024 | [[Microsoft]] | Inflection | $650M | Licensing |
| 2024 | [[Amazon]] | Adept | — | Acqui-hire |

## Regulatory environment

- FTC and DOJ investigating some deals
- Trump Dec 2025 executive order: softer antitrust enforcement
- Trump wants US to win AI race vs China — may look favorably on neutralizing Chinese competition via M&A

---

## China angle

**Shift in dynamic:** China now producing innovators (vs copying in early mobile era)

- "Meta copied TikTok features... Now in the AI age, Meta purchases Manus" — Winston Ma, NYU

**Chinese AI startups positioning for US exits:**
- Manus: HQ'd in Singapore, scrubbed China links before Meta deal
- New generation of Chinese founders more globally-minded
- Potential targets: [[Zhipu]], Moonshot AI

**Exception:** [[DeepSeek]] unlikely to sell due to geopolitical sensitivity

## Investment implications

### Bullish Big Tech
- Mag 7 likely to entrench dominance
- Pick up talent and IP at distressed prices
- Regulatory environment favorable under Trump

### Bearish AI startups
- "Darwinian thinning" ahead
- Even OpenAI/Anthropic unlikely to unseat Mag 7
- Best exit may be acqui-hire, not IPO

### Historical parallel
Same pattern occurred with cloud software → PE-driven acquisitions in 2020-2021
