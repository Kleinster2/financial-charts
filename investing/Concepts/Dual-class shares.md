**Dual-class shares** — a stock structure where different classes of common stock carry unequal voting rights. Founders/insiders hold "super-voting" shares (typically 10 votes per share) while public investors get standard shares (1 vote each). Allows founders to maintain corporate control despite minority economic ownership.

## How it works

| Class | Typical holder | Votes per share | Economic rights |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Class A | Public investors | 1 | Equal |
| Class B | Founders/insiders | 10 (sometimes 20) | Equal |
| Class C (rare) | Issued later | 0 | Equal |

A founder with 15% economic ownership but 100% Class B shares can hold >60% of total votes.

### Recent IPOs (2023-2024)

| Company | IPO year | Sunset | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Klaviyo]] | 2023 | 7 years | — |
| [[Reddit]] | 2024 | Ownership-based (8% threshold) | No time-based sunset |
| [[Rubrik]] | 2024 | 10 years | — |
| ServiceTitan | 2024 | 15 years + ownership (20% threshold) | — |
| Tempus AI | 2024 | 20 years | Longest modern sunset |

Prevalence: 32% of all IPOs in 2021, 26% in 2023. Among tech IPOs specifically: 46% in 2021, 44% in 2023.

### Legacy/non-tech

| Company | Structure | Control holder |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [[Berkshire Hathaway]] | Class A (1 vote) vs Class B (1/200th vote) | [[Warren Buffett]] — enabled decades of reinvestment over dividends |
| [[Ford]] | 40% family voting via Class B | Ford family — since 1956 IPO |
| [[Nike]] | Class A (non-voting) / Class B (voting) | Knight family |
| [[Comcast]] | Super-voting Class B | Roberts family |
| [[Hershey]] | Trust controls ~80% of votes | Hershey Trust |
| [[Alibaba]] | Partnership structure (28 insiders control board nominations) | [[Jack Ma]] — listed NYSE 2014 after HKEx rejected structure |
| [[Levi Strauss]] | 10:1 Class B | Haas family |
| [[Ralph Lauren]] | 10:1 Class B | Ralph Lauren |
| New York Times | Class B controls board | Sulzberger family — editorial independence argument |

### Planned

| Company | IPO year | Structure | Founder control |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| [[SpaceX]] | 2026 (planned) | TBD | [[Elon Musk]] ~79% votes |

[[Palantir]]'s Class F is uniquely extreme — it dynamically adjusts to always equal 49.999999% of total voting power regardless of ownership changes. [[Snap]] remains the only major IPO to give public investors zero votes.

## Arguments for

- Insulates founders from short-term shareholder pressure
- Enables bold long-term moves (e.g. [[Meta]]'s $1B [[Instagram]] acquisition in 2012, initially controversial)
- US study (1980-2022): dual-class tech companies outperformed single-class peers
- Protects against hostile takeovers

## Arguments against

- Reduced accountability — entrenches management regardless of performance
- Self-dealing risk — controlling shareholders can prioritize personal interests
- Generational entrenchment — control passes to heirs without market discipline
- No mechanism to remove underperforming leadership

---

## Institutional pushback

- [[Council of Institutional Investors]]: lobbies for "one share, one vote" and sunset provisions (7-year conversion). Academic research finds dual-class valuation premium fades to a discount after ~7 years
- S&P Dow Jones Indices: banned dual-class from S&P 500 in 2017, then reversed in April 2023 — dual-class companies now eligible again. [[DoorDash]] and [[Palantir]] subsequently added to S&P 500/100
- FTSE Russell: requires minimum 5% voting rights for index inclusion
- Yale study (2024): dual-class Russell 3000 companies outperformed single-class peers across short and long term

---

## Sunset provisions

Some dual-class IPOs include time-based or event-based conversion clauses:
- Shares convert to single class after fixed period (7-10 years)
- Convert on founder death/departure
- Convert if founder's ownership drops below threshold

Not universal — [[Google]], [[Meta]], and [[Snap]] have no mandatory sunsets.

---

## SpaceX context (Feb 2026)

[[SpaceX]] weighing formal dual-class structure for its mid-2026 IPO. [[Elon Musk]] currently holds ~42% equity but ~79% voting control. A dual-class IPO would formalize this arrangement for public markets — ensuring Musk retains control of the combined SpaceX-[[xAI]] entity even after dilution from the planned $30-50B raise.

Key concern for institutional investors: Musk's "key-man risk" is amplified when that key man can't be checked by shareholders.
