**[[Cuba]]-Venezuela axis** — Venezuela has been [[Cuba]]'s economic lifeline since 2000, replacing Soviet subsidies. ~$60B in support over 20 years. Maduro's fall threatens Cuban regime survival.

---

## Why it matters

[[Cuba]] survived decades of US confrontation via:
1. **Soviet subsidies** (until 1991)
2. **Venezuelan subsidies** (2000-2026)

With Maduro captured, [[Cuba]] loses its lifeline. **Rubio's strategy:** Topple Caracas to starve Havana.

## The deal

**[[Oil]]-for-services partnership** (signed October 2000):

| Venezuela provides | [[Cuba]] provides |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Subsidized/free oil | Doctors (tens of thousands) |
| Cash transfers | Intelligence/security personnel |
| Political backing | Economic advisors |
| Petrocaribe membership | Regime protection expertise |

---

## [[Oil]] flows

| Period | Barrels/day | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 2000 | 53,000 | Initial agreement |
| 2005 | 90,000 | Peak |
| 2010s | 100,000 | Height of relationship |
| 2020s | ~30,000-35,000 | US sanctions crackdown |
| Jan 2026 | ? | Maduro captured — uncertain |

**Free oil:** ~20,000-26,000 bpd provided at no cost — "gift" worth $6-8B through 2020.

---

## Total support

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total transfers (2002-2022) | ~$60B (opposition estimate) |
| Peak annual trade | $7.3B (2014) |
| 2016 trade | $2.2B (declining) |

---

## [[Cuba]]'s vulnerability

**Before Maduro capture:**
- Already receiving only ~35,000 bpd (25% of demand)
- Economy in crisis
- Blackouts, shortages
- 2024 protests

**After Maduro capture:**
- [[Oil]] supply uncertain
- No alternative patron
- [[Russia]] distracted (Ukraine)
- [[China]] unwilling to fully replace

---

## Rubio's calculation

| If Venezuela falls... | Then [[Cuba]]... |
|----------------------|--------------|
| [[Oil]] supply cut | Energy crisis deepens |
| Cash transfers stop | Fiscal collapse |
| Political cover gone | Isolated |
| Regime change precedent | Next target |

**The play:** Venezuela is the supply line. Cut it, and [[Cuba]] falls.

---

## Historical parallel

| Patron | Period | End |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Soviet Union | 1960-1991 | USSR collapse |
| Venezuela | 2000-2026 | US intervention |
| Next? | — | None in sight |

[[Cuba]] has never survived without a patron. Venezuela was the second. There is no third.

---

## Implications

### For [[Cuba]]

- Regime survival threatened
- May need to negotiate with US
- Or face collapse like 1990s "Special Period"

### For Rubio

- Venezuela = stepping stone to [[Cuba]]
- Family history (Cuban exile)
- Long-term goal: Havana regime change

### For Venezuela

- [[Cuba]] loses influence over security apparatus
- Cuban advisors may leave
- Intelligence cooperation ends

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Marco Rubio** | Secretary of State, Cuban-American, architect |
| **[[Cuba]]** | Dependent, vulnerable |
| [[Venezuela]] | Former patron, now US-controlled |
| **Díaz-Canel** | Cuban president, weakened |
