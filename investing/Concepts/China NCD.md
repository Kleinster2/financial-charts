**China NCD** (Negotiable Certificate of Deposit) — Short-term debt instrument issued by Chinese banks. 1-year NCD yield is the key indicator of bank funding costs and liquidity conditions. Equivalent to [[CDI]] in Brazil or commercial paper in US.

---

## Definition

NCDs are standardized, tradeable certificates issued by deposit-taking institutions in China's interbank market. Introduced in 2013 to develop market-based funding for banks.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Issuers | Commercial banks (state-owned, joint-stock, city, rural) |
| Tenors | 1M, 3M, 6M, 9M, 1Y |
| Trading venue | China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) |
| Reference rate | 1-year NCD most watched |
| Outstanding | ~18 trillion yuan (~$2.5T) |

## Current level

| Date | 1-year NCD yield |
|------|------------------|
| Feb 2026 | ~1.6% |
| 2025 high | ~2.2% |

Yields near lowest in a year after record [[PBOC]] liquidity injection (1 trillion yuan net in Jan 2026).

## Why it matters

### Bank funding barometer

NCD yields reflect:
- PBOC liquidity stance
- Interbank funding stress
- Bank deposit competition
- Loan demand (inverse)

**High NCD yields** = tight funding, banks competing for deposits
**Low NCD yields** = excess liquidity, weak loan demand

### Carry trade indicator

Banks borrow short (NCDs) to buy long (government bonds). The spread between NCD yields and long-tenor CGB yields indicates:
- Incentive for duration extension
- Steepness/flatness of bank funding curve
- Risk appetite in bond market

**Feb 2026 spread:**
| Instrument | Yield |
|------------|-------|
| 1-year NCD | ~1.6% |
| 30-year CGB | ~2.3% |
| **Spread** | **~60+ bps** |

Spread near widest since 2022 — banks have strong incentive to buy long-dated bonds.

## Relationship to PBOC policy

| PBOC action | NCD impact |
|-------------|------------|
| MLF injection | Lowers NCD yields |
| Reverse repo injection | Lowers short NCD yields |
| RRR cut | Structural liquidity, lowers NCDs |
| Tightening | Raises NCD yields |

NCD yields typically trade above PBOC's 1-year MLF rate (currently 2.0%) but can compress below during excess liquidity episodes.

## Regulatory context (Jan 2026)

Chinese regulators loosened interest rate risk measures (per Basel standards) from start of 2026. This expanded banks' capacity to hold longer-duration bonds, channeling NCD-funded liquidity into the long end.

## Comparison to other benchmarks

| Country | Benchmark | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **China** | 1-year NCD | Bank funding cost |
| [[Brazil]] | [[CDI]] | Overnight interbank rate |
| US | Fed Funds / SOFR | Overnight secured/unsecured |
| Japan | TIBOR / TONA | Interbank rates |

Unlike CDI (overnight), China's NCD market is term-based, with 1-year as the key tenor for bank ALM.

## Bond market transmission

**Mechanism (Feb 2026):**

1. PBOC injects record liquidity via MLF/reverse repo
2. Bank deposits rise, loan demand stays weak
3. Banks flush with cash, NCDs yields collapse
4. 60+ bps spread to 30-year CGBs = attractive carry
5. Banks bid for long-dated government bonds
6. Long-end yields decline despite heavy issuance

This is how PBOC liquidity transmits to the bond market even without explicit bond purchases (unlike Fed QE).
