## Commodity supercycles

Historical supercycles driven by:
1. **1970s** — Oil shocks, inflation
2. **2000s** — China industrialization
3. **2020s?** — Green transition, supply underinvestment

Current debate: Are we in early stages of new supercycle driven by electrification and underinvestment?

## Contango vs backwardation

| Structure | Meaning | Impact on ETFs |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Contango** | Futures > spot | Negative roll yield (drag) |
| **Backwardation** | Spot > futures | Positive roll yield (boost) |

Most commodity ETFs hold futures, not physical. Roll yield matters for long-term returns.
