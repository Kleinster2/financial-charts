**PE-insurance convergence** — The structural trend of private equity firms acquiring or building insurance platforms to access [[Permanent capital|permanent capital]]. Every major PE firm now owns an insurer: [[Apollo]]/[[Athene]], [[KKR]]/[[Global Atlantic]], [[Blackstone]]/[[F&G Annuities]], [[Carlyle Group]]/[[Fortitude Re]], [[Brookfield]]/[[American Equity]]. Reshaping both industries.

## Why this matters

This is the most important structural shift in alternative asset management since the LBO boom. It changes what PE firms *are* — from fund managers running closed-end vehicles to financial conglomerates with permanent balance sheets.

**The numbers:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PE-owned US insurers | 139 (Jun 2025, NAIC) |
| Net new PE capital into life/annuity (since 2014) | >$31B |
| Bermuda reinsurance from US life/health | $928B (up from $205B in 2014) |
| Combined insurance AUM (top 5 PE-insurers) | >$1T |

## The thesis: why PE firms buy insurers

### 1. Permanent capital
Traditional PE: raise fund → deploy → return capital → fundraise again. 10-year cycles, J-curve, return-of-capital pressure.

Insurance: collect premiums → invest float → compound indefinitely. No redemptions, no fundraising droughts, no forced exits.

See [[Permanent capital]] for deeper treatment.

### 2. Cost of capital arbitrage
| Source | Cost of capital | Duration |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| PE fund LPs | 15-20% hurdle rate | 10 years |
| Insurance liabilities (annuities) | ~3-4% crediting rate | 20-30 years |
| Insurance float (pre-claims) | ~0% (Buffett model) | Indefinite |

PE firms borrow at 3-4% via insurance, invest in private credit at 8-12%, pocket the spread. The math only works because insurance liabilities are *long-duration* and *predictable*.

### 3. Fee income on managed assets
Apollo earns ~1.4% on assets originated through Athene vs. ~0.4% on traditional third-party AUM. Insurance = 3.5x more revenue per dollar managed.

### 4. Asset reallocation opportunity
Traditional insurers held conservative portfolios (government bonds, IG corporate credit). PE sponsors reposition into higher-yielding alternatives — private credit, infrastructure, real estate, CLOs. The yield pickup flows to earnings.

### 5. Secular tailwind: retirement
$51T global retirement protection gap (GFIA 2023). Aging demographics + defined benefit pension closures + bank retreat from lending = structural demand for annuity products and [[Pension risk transfer]].

## The flywheel

```
Issue annuities/reinsure pension liabilities
        ↓
Collect long-duration premiums/reserves
        ↓
PE sponsor manages float (private credit, infra, real estate)
        ↓
Spread income + management fees
        ↓
Capital supports more origination → repeat
```

McKinsey calls this the self-reinforcing flywheel: policy issuance at scale + differentiated asset management + capital flexibility.

## Post-GFC origins

After 2008, near-zero rates put traditional insurers underwater — annuity payouts exceeded investment-grade fixed income returns. PE spotted the mismatch:
- Insurers needed to offload liabilities
- PE firms could invest the float at higher yields
- [[Athene]] was purpose-built for this (2009)
- Others followed: KKR/Global Atlantic (2021), Brookfield/American Equity (2024)

## The landscape (2025)

| PE Firm | Insurance Platform | Assets | Relationship |
|---------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| [[Apollo]] | [[Athene]] | $430B | Merged (2022) |
| [[KKR]] | [[Global Atlantic]] | >$200B | 100% owned (2024) |
| [[Brookfield]] | [[American Equity]] | $130B | Acquired $4.3B (2024) |
| [[Carlyle Group]] | [[Fortitude Re]] | $106B | 38.5% + advisory |
| [[Blackstone]] | [[F&G Annuities]] | $71B | Sidecar partnership (2025) |

See [[Reinsurance sidecars]] for the capital structures enabling this.

## Risks and criticism

**"Trader's option" moral hazard:** PE managers earn fees on AUM but don't bear capital loss risk directly. Incentive to reach for yield with policyholder money.

**Liquidity mismatch:** Insurance liabilities are long-duration but theoretically surrenderable. Mass lapse + illiquid assets = forced selling.

**Regulatory arbitrage:** Bermuda/Cayman reinsurance affiliates face less stringent capital rules than US insurers. Regulators tightening (BMA, IAIS, JFSA reviews in 2025).

**Systemic concentration:** Five PE firms managing >$1T of insurance assets. Credit cycle downturn could hit all simultaneously.

**Berkshire's concession:** Ajit Jain (2025 shareholder meeting) — Berkshire can no longer compete because PE firms take on more leverage and credit risk.

## Investment implications

**For PE firms:** Insurance transforms economics — permanent capital, higher fee margins, recurring earnings. Explains why Apollo trades at premium multiples vs. traditional PE.

**For insurers:** Traditional insurers losing scale/relevance. Either partner with PE or compete at disadvantage on investment returns.

**For policyholders:** Higher returns enable competitive annuity rates. But concentration + private credit allocation = new tail risks.
