## Current tariff structure (Jan 2026)

| Tariff type | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| **General rate** | ~49% | Down from 59% after fentanyl tariff cut |
| **Section 301** | 25-100% | Product-specific |
| **Fentanyl-related** | 10% | Cut from 20% (Nov 2025 deal) |
| **Reciprocal** | 10% | Extended to Nov 2026 |

**Tariff stacking:** Chinese goods can face multiple overlapping tariffs (301 + fentanyl + reciprocal + MFN).

## Iran-linked tariff escalation (Jan 14, 2026)

Trump announced 25% tariff on any country "doing business with Iran" — **could push China tariffs to 74%+**.

| Current | Add-on | Potential total |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 49% (general) | +25% (Iran) | **74%+** |

**China exposure:**
- $9B+ annual trade with Iran (ex-oil)
- 90%+ of Iran's oil exports go to China (via intermediaries)
- Foreign Ministry: "No winners in a tariff war"

**Implementation unclear:** No executive action published yet. "Doing business" undefined. Relies on IEEPA (Supreme Court challenge pending).

See [[Iran]] for full context.

## Supreme Court challenge

**Case:** Challenges Trump's authority to impose tariffs via emergency powers.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Oral arguments | November 2025 |
| Expected ruling | Delayed — next opinion day Jan 14, 2026 |
| Kalshi odds | 28% tariffs survive as-is |
| Revenue at stake | $195B (FY2025) + $62B (FY2026 to date) |

**Bessent response:** Administration has backup authority via 1962 Trade Act. "What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level."

**If struck down:** Could jeopardize ~1/3 of proposed military budget.

---

## Phase One deal (2020)

China committed to purchase $200B above 2017 baseline over 2 years:

| Category | Target | Actual |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Manufacturing | $77.7B | ~60% |
| Agriculture | $32B | ~80% |
| Energy | $52.4B | ~40% |
| Services | $37.9B | ~50% |

**Result:** China fell ~40% short. Deal effectively dead but never formally terminated.

---

## Current exclusions

178 products excluded until Nov 2026:
- Solar manufacturing equipment
- Machinery components
- Electric motors
- Medical devices
- Vehicle components

## Statutory vs actual tariff rates (Jan 2026)

**Key finding (Gopinath/Neiman, Dec 2025):** Statutory tariff rates ≠ actual rates paid.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average statutory rate | 27.4% (late Sept) |
| Average rate actually paid | **~13.7%** (half statutory) |

**Why the gap:**

1. **"On the water exemption"** — shipment lags mean months pass before new tariffs apply
2. **Product/company exemptions** — specific breaks for certain goods/firms
3. **Investment incentives** — favorable treatment for US manufacturing commitments
4. **USMCA** — Canada/Mexico trade largely unaffected

**Gopinath quote:** "The peak of the storm may have passed, but as Dorothy observed in The Wizard of Oz, 'we're not in Kansas anymore.'"

**Implication:** Headline tariff rates overstate actual trade friction. Damage may take years to materialize.

---

## Trade flow impact

| Metric | 2017 (pre-war) | 2025 |
|--------|----------------|------|
| US imports from China | $505B | ~$427B |
| US exports to China | $130B | ~$145B |
| Deficit | $375B | ~$282B |

**Shift:** Some manufacturing moved to Vietnam, Mexico, India — but often Chinese-owned or Chinese-supplied.

---

## Investment implications

**Winners from tariffs:**
- US domestic manufacturers (protection)
- Mexico/Vietnam/SEA (supply chain shift)
- Tariff revenue plays (if sustained)

**SEA resilience (Jan 2026):**
- [[Vietnam Tech]]: Q4 GDP +8%, $134B trade surplus (record)
- [[Singapore Tech]]: 2025 GDP +4.8%
- Both negotiated favorable rates (~20% vs 46% initial)

**Losers:**
- US importers (higher costs)
- China-dependent retailers
- Companies with China manufacturing

**Supreme Court risk:** 28% chance tariffs invalidated → importer refund claims, policy chaos.

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **USTR** | Trade policy, Section 301 |
| **Commerce (BIS)** | Export controls |
| **Treasury (Bessent)** | Revenue, deal negotiation |
| **Supreme Court** | Constitutional challenge |
| [[China]] | Counterparty |
