US-China tariffs — Tariff policy, Section 301 duties, and trade deals. IEEPA tariffs struck down by [[Supreme Court]] on Feb 20, 2026 ([[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]]). Section 301 and Section 232 tariffs remain.

Part of [[US-China trade]] umbrella.

## Current tariff structure (post-SCOTUS, Feb 20 2026)

| Tariff type | Rate | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Section 301 | 25-100% | Survives — product-specific |
| [[Section 232 semiconductor tariff]] | 25% | Survives — AI chips |
| Section 232 (steel/aluminum) | 25% | Survives |
| ~~Fentanyl-related (IEEPA)~~ | ~~10%~~ | Struck down — [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]] |
| ~~Reciprocal (IEEPA)~~ | ~~10%~~ | Struck down — [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]] |
| ~~General IEEPA~~ | ~~varies~~ | Struck down |

Effective tariff rate on China drops substantially — IEEPA reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs eliminated. Section 301 product-specific tariffs (25-100%) remain. Net rate depends on product mix.

Pre-SCOTUS (Jan 2026): ~49% general rate. Post-SCOTUS: Section 301 rates only (25-100% on covered products, 0% on uncovered).

## [[Trade]] war timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2018 | Trump imposes Section 301 tariffs ($34B, then $200B) |
| 2019 | Escalation to $550B in tariffs, China retaliates |
| 2020 | Phase One deal — China commits to $200B purchases |
| 2021-2024 | Biden maintains tariffs, adds EV/solar duties |
| May 2025 | Trump 2.0 escalates to 145% reciprocal |
| May 2025 | Deal: both sides cut to 10% reciprocal |
| Nov 2025 | Trump-Xi meeting extends deal to Nov 2026 |

## Iran-linked tariff escalation (Jan 14, 2026)

Trump announced 25% tariff on any country "doing business with Iran" — could push China tariffs to 74%+.

| Current | Add-on | Potential total |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 49% (general) | +25% (Iran) | 74%+ |

China exposure:
- $9B+ annual trade with Iran (ex-oil)
- 90%+ of Iran's oil exports go to China (via intermediaries)
- Foreign Ministry: "No winners in a tariff war"

Implementation unclear: No executive action published yet. "Doing business" undefined. Relies on IEEPA (Supreme Court challenge pending).

See [[Iran]] for full context.

## Supreme Court ruling (Feb 20, 2026)

RULED: IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional. See [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]] for full details.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Decision | 6-3 — IEEPA does not authorize tariffs |
| Majority | [[John Roberts]], Sotomayor, Kagan, [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]], Jackson |
| Dissent | Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh |
| Revenue at risk | $175-179B collected under IEEPA (Penn-Wharton) |
| Daily revenue lost | ~$500M/day |
| Effective rate change | 16.1% → 10.4% |

Admin response: Will use Section 232, Section 301, Section 122 (15% max, 150 days), Section 338 (50% max, never used) to replace. JPMorgan trading desk: 64% odds of "struck down + immediately replaced."

Iran secondary tariffs: Also relied on IEEPA — now invalid. See [[Secondary sanctions]].

## Phase One deal (2020)

China committed to purchase $200B above 2017 baseline over 2 years:

| Category | [[Target]] | Actual |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Manufacturing | $77.7B | ~60% |
| [[Agriculture]] | $32B | ~80% |
| Energy | $52.4B | ~40% |
| Services | $37.9B | ~50% |

Result: China fell ~40% short. Deal effectively dead but never formally terminated.

## Current exclusions

178 products excluded until Nov 2026:
- Solar manufacturing equipment
- Machinery components
- Electric motors
- Medical devices
- Vehicle components

## Statutory vs actual tariff rates (Jan 2026)

Key finding (Gopinath/Neiman, Dec 2025): Statutory tariff rates ≠ actual rates paid.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average statutory rate | 27.4% (late Sept) |
| Average rate actually paid | ~13.7% (half statutory) |

Why the gap:

1. "On the water exemption" — shipment lags mean months pass before new tariffs apply
2. Product/company exemptions — specific breaks for certain goods/firms
3. Investment incentives — favorable treatment for US manufacturing commitments
4. [[USMCA]] — [[Canada]]/[[Mexico]] trade largely unaffected

Gopinath quote: "The peak of the storm may have passed, but as Dorothy observed in The Wizard of Oz, 'we're not in Kansas anymore.'"

Implication: Headline tariff rates overstate actual trade friction. Damage may take years to materialize.

---

## [[Trade]] flow impact

| Metric | 2017 (pre-war) | 2025 |
|--------|----------------|------|
| US imports from China | $505B | ~$427B |
| US exports to China | $130B | ~$145B |
| Deficit | $375B | ~$282B |

Shift: Some manufacturing moved to Vietnam, [[Mexico]], [[India]] — but often Chinese-owned or Chinese-supplied.

## Investment implications

Winners from tariffs:
- US domestic manufacturers (protection)
- [[Mexico]]/Vietnam/SEA (supply chain shift)
- Tariff revenue plays (if sustained)

SEA resilience (Jan 2026):
- [[Vietnam Tech]]: Q4 GDP +8%, $134B trade surplus (record)
- [[Singapore Tech]]: 2025 GDP +4.8%
- Both negotiated favorable rates (~20% vs 46% initial)

Losers:
- US importers (higher costs)
- China-dependent retailers
- Companies with China manufacturing

Post-SCOTUS (Feb 20, 2026): IEEPA tariffs struck down. Reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs eliminated. Section 301 product-specific tariffs remain. $175B+ in importer refund claims expected. Admin pivoting to Section 232/301 replacement tariffs. See [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]].

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| USTR | [[Trade]] policy, Section 301 |
| Commerce ([[BIS]]) | Export controls |
| Treasury (Bessent) | Revenue, deal negotiation |
| Supreme Court | Constitutional challenge |
| [[China]] | Counterparty |
