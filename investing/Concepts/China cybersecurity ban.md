## Company responses

| Company | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **CrowdStrike** | "We do not sell into China and do not have offices, hire people or host infrastructure there, and thus could only be negligibly affected." |
| **SentinelOne** | "No direct revenue exposure to China." |
| **Recorded Future** | "No business in China and no intention of doing so." |

## Strategic context

**Part of broader tech decoupling:**
- Follows [[Export controls]] on semiconductors
- Responds to US bans on Chinese tech (Huawei, TikTok)
- Parallels Kaspersky removal from US government systems (2017-2024)

**Domestic beneficiaries:**
- Chinese cybersecurity vendors gain captive market
- Similar to 50% domestic equipment mandate for semiconductors

## Historical parallel: Kaspersky

| Event | Year |
|-------|------|
| Kaspersky removed from US govt systems | 2017 |
| US sales ban | 2024 |

China now applying same logic to Western cybersecurity vendors.

## Investment implications

**Limited direct impact:**
- Most affected US/Israeli firms have minimal China revenue
- CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Recorded Future explicitly stated no exposure

**Broader signal:**
- Accelerates tech bifurcation
- Domestic Chinese cybersecurity market now protected
- Western vendors lose potential future market access
