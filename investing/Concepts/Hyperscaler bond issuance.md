**Hyperscaler bond issuance** — The wave of corporate debt issuance by [[AI hyperscalers]] to fund AI infrastructure capex that is exceeding free cash flow. Emerged as a distinct pattern in 2025, accelerating sharply in 2026.

---

## Why this matters

AI capex is now outpacing cash generation at most hyperscalers, forcing them into debt markets at scale. This creates a structural shift — tech companies that were historically net-cash are becoming leveraged borrowers.

| Company | 2026 capex | Cash from ops (est.) | Gap | LT debt |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|-----|---------|
| [[Amazon]] | $200B | $180B | -$20B | Filing signals raise |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] | $185B | $195B | +$10B (pre-buybacks) | $46.5B (4x in 2025) |
| [[Meta]] | $135B | $130B | -$5B | $60B+ (Blue Owl SPV) |
| [[Microsoft]] | ~$80B | ~$95B | +$15B | Most resilient (BNP) |
| [[Oracle]] | ~$25B+ | — | — | $93B total debt |

## Scale of the wave

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Hyperscaler bonds issued (2025) | $121B | BofA Securities (5 names: AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, ORCL) |
| Hyperscaler bonds forecast (2026) | **$400B** | [[Morgan Stanley]] |
| Total IG issuance forecast (2026) | **$2.25T** (record) | [[Morgan Stanley]] |
| Global bond issuance pace (Feb 2026) | Hit $1T in record time | Bloomberg |
| High-grade inflows (week of Feb 4) | $6.44B | 5-year high |
| TD Securities expected IG (week of Feb 10) | $80B | 2x normal pace |

The $400B hyperscaler forecast represents a 2.4x increase from 2025. If realized, hyperscaler debt alone would account for ~18% of total US IG issuance.

## Spread dynamics

Spreads remain historically tight despite the supply surge — demand is absorbing the flood:

| Deal | Initial guidance | Final pricing | Tightening |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Alphabet 2066 tranche | ~120 bps over Treasuries | ~95 bps | -25 bps |
| [[Meta]] 40-year tranche | — | T+110 | — |
| IG OAS (Feb 5) | — | 76 bps | Near cycle lows |

New issues underperformed JPMorgan US Liquid Index by 4 bps over the 10 days prior to Feb 7 — the largest underperformance since October. Early sign of indigestion.

## Skeptics

| Voice | Argument |
|-------|----------|
| [[Michael Burry]] | Alphabet [[Century Bond]] mirrors [[Motorola]] 1997 — tech dominance is fragile over 100 years |
| [[Richard Bernstein Advisors]] | "Everything bubble" — AI credit risk creates asymmetric downside for bondholders |
| Alexander Morris (F/m Investments) | "Leaves little upside and even less room for error" |
| Ali Meli (Monachil Capital) | "It doesn't take too many adverse events to create a selloff" |
| [[BNP Paribas]] | FCF at Oracle, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta "plummeting toward negative territory" |

The bull case: hyperscalers have unmatched revenue bases ($400B+ for Alphabet), massive cash generation, and AI spending is creating durable competitive moats. The bear case: credit investors bear downside risk without AI upside, and 40-year bonds on 5-10 year tech cycles is a fundamental mismatch.

## Software credit contagion (Feb 2026)

AI disruption is hitting credit markets beyond issuers — software leveraged loans fell 4% YTD through Feb 6. BDC equity index dropped 4.6% in the week of Feb 3. Average BDC software exposure exceeds 20% of portfolios ([[Barclays]]). See [[Credit markets]] for details.
