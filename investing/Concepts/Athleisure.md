# Athleisure

Activewear designed for both exercise and everyday wear. The category barely existed before 2000; by 2025 it is a ~$400-430B global market growing at ~9% CAGR. [[Lululemon]] created the category with technical yoga pants in 1998, and the trend accelerated through remote work normalization and casualization of dress codes.

## Origins and timeline

[[Lululemon]] founder Chip Wilson attended a yoga class in 1997 and noticed women wearing cotton that didn't perform well. He launched technical yoga pants in 1998 from a Vancouver studio that doubled as a yoga space at night. Key milestones:

- 1998 — [[Lululemon]] opens first store, sells nylon/Lycra yoga pants
- 2005 — Luon stretch fabric introduced; 15 stores in [[Canada]]
- 2014 — US teenagers prefer yoga pants to jeans; [[Levi Strauss]] forced to add stretch denim
- 2016 — Merriam-Webster adds "athleisure" to the dictionary
- 2017 — Lululemon yoga pants displayed at MoMA
- 2020+ — Remote work accelerates adoption; category crosses $300B

## Structural drivers

- Casualization of workplaces and dress codes (decades-long trend)
- Work-from-home normalization post-COVID
- Fabric technology (moisture-wicking, four-way stretch, compression)
- Fitness culture and wellness spending growth
- Social media driving lifestyle branding over pure performance

## Category maturation risk

US athleisure growth is slowing — [[Lululemon]] US comps were +2% in Q1 2025 vs double-digit historically. Competition is fragmenting share. [[Hugo Boss]] suffered a five-year revenue stagnation (2015-2020) as athleisure disrupted premium menswear. The category may be shifting from growth to share-fight dynamics in developed markets, while Asia-Pacific remains underpenetrated.
