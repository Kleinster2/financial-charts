# GS US Software Basket

[[Goldman Sachs]] sector basket tracking US software stocks. Not an AI disruption-specific index — includes software broadly (beneficiaries and victims).

## Performance

## What it is

A broad US software sector basket maintained by GS equity research. Referenced in Bloomberg and Reuters coverage of the Feb 3-4 selloff. Ticker likely in the GSXU family but not publicly confirmed.

**Key distinction:** This is a *sector* basket, not a *disruption* basket. It includes companies that benefit from AI (platforms, dev tools) alongside companies threatened by AI (legal, data analytics). This is why it fell -6% while purer disruption plays like [[Thomson Reuters]] fell -18%.
