Utility wildfire risk — Utilities face existential liability when their equipment sparks wildfires. Defensive response: proactive power shutoffs (PSPS), which create their own economic and political costs.

## The problem

Utility transmission and distribution lines can spark fires during hot, dry, windy conditions. When they do, utilities face inverse condemnation liability — responsible for damages regardless of negligence in some states (notably California).

| Precedent | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| [[PG&E]] Camp Fire (2018) | 85 deaths, $30B+ in liabilities, bankruptcy (2019) |
| [[Edison International]] Eaton fire (2025) | 19 deaths, hundreds of lawsuits, equipment fault detected on transmission line |
| [[Xcel Energy]] Marshall Fire (2021) | Boulder County, Colorado — $2B+ in claims |

## Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)

Utilities proactively de-energize lines when fire conditions are extreme. Pioneered by San Diego Gas & Electric, scaled by [[PG&E]] starting 2018.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PG&E weather stations | 1,600+ (reporting every 10 min) |
| PG&E PSPS customer impact (2025) | Down 64% vs 2024 |
| PG&E fast-trip outages (2025) | ~839,000 customers |
| Xcel Colorado shutoffs (Dec-Jan 2026) | 50,000+ customers, multiple rounds |
| Largest single PSPS | ~1M customers (PG&E, Oct 27 2019) |

How the call is made: Meteorology teams monitor real-time wind speed, humidity, temperature, and fuel moisture from station networks. AI/ML models predict both ignition probability and potential damage. Human meteorologists make the final call. PG&E's Scott Strenfel described it as a "man-machine mix."

The tradeoff: Shutoffs prevent fires but cause economic harm — refrigerated medicine lost, medical equipment offline, hospitals shuttered. PG&E was fined >$100M by state regulators after the Oct 2019 shutoff. But post-shutoff inspections found 550+ instances of line damage that could have sparked fires.

## Spreading beyond California

As of early 2026, PSPS programs are expanding nationally:

| Utility | Region | Context |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [[PG&E]] | Northern/Central California | Pioneer, most developed program |
| [[Edison International]] (SCE) | Southern California | Post-Eaton fire lawsuits |
| [[Xcel Energy]] | Colorado, Midwest | Multiple Boulder/Fort Collins shutoffs Dec-Jan 2026 |
| NV Energy | Nevada | Carson City shutoff before Christmas 2025 |
| Cheyenne utility | Wyoming | Prepared PSPS amid January 2026 winds |
| Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii | Maui fire aftermath |

Weather driver (2025-26): La Niña holding rain and snow at bay across US West. Fine grasses dried out across Texas, New Mexico, Colorado. Pattern projected to continue into spring 2026.

## Investment implications

For utilities:
- Wildfire liability is an existential tail risk — PG&E's bankruptcy proved this
- PSPS programs are defensive but politically costly
- Underground line burial dramatically reduces risk but costs billions and takes years
- Regulatory outcomes on fire liability define equity value

For insurers:
- Insured wildfire losses at record highs — see [[P&C Insurance]]
- Reinsurance repricing ongoing
- California FAIR Plan (insurer of last resort) under strain

Intersection with AI power demand:
- Grid stress from data center load adds complexity to fire risk management
- Utilities can't simultaneously expand capacity and reduce fire exposure without massive capex
- See [[Power constraints]]
