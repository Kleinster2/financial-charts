## Market overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Wafer share | 17% (2024) |
| Growth 2025e | +7% |
| Status | Post-boom settling |

Automotive was hot during EV hype (2021-2023), now normalizing.

## Key segments

### Silicon Carbide (SiC)

Power semiconductors for EV inverters, chargers. Higher efficiency than silicon.

**Key players:**
- STMicroelectronics — $1.1B SiC revenue (2024)
- Wolfspeed — SiC specialist
- Infineon — European leader
- onsemi — growing share

**Current state (Dec 2025):**
- STMicro: 2025 "transition year" (decline), 2026 growth but below 2024, 2027 back to 2024 levels
- Main customer (Tesla?) inventory correction
- EV penetration slower than expected 2 years ago

### Power semiconductors (Silicon)

IGBTs, MOSFETs for motor control, power management.

**Key players:**
- Infineon
- onsemi
- STMicro
- Texas Instruments

### ADAS / Autonomous

Sensors, compute for driver assistance.

**Key players:**
- Mobileye (Intel)
- NVIDIA (Drive platform)
- Qualcomm (Snapdragon Ride)

## Why it's different from AI/datacenter

| Factor | AI/Datacenter | Automotive |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Growth | Accelerating | Settling |
| Demand driver | Hyperscaler capex | Consumer EV adoption |
| Node | Leading edge (2nm, 3nm) | Mature + specialty (SiC) |
| Cycle | Structural | Cyclical + secular |

Auto doesn't compete for leading edge capacity — different fabs, different bottlenecks.

## EV adoption vs expectations

- 2021-2022: Hype peak, chip shortage, massive auto semi investment
- 2023-2024: EV growth slowed, inventory correction
- 2025-2027: Normalization, slower penetration than expected

STMicro SiC revenue trajectory tells the story:
- 2024: $1.1B (peak)
- 2025: Decline (transition)
- 2026: Growth but below 2024
- 2027: Back to 2024 levels

---

## Relationship to foundry wars

**Minimal overlap with AI/foundry themes:**
- Auto uses mature nodes (28nm+) — not leading edge
- SiC is specialty fab (not TSMC/Samsung)
- Different supply chain (Infineon, STMicro have own fabs)

**Some overlap:**
- NVIDIA Drive for autonomous
- Qualcomm auto chips (TSMC)
- Advanced ADAS compute moving to smaller nodes

## What to watch

- [ ] EV adoption rates (China, Europe, US)
- [ ] Tesla production / inventory
- [ ] SiC pricing and capacity
- [ ] ADAS compute complexity increasing
- [ ] Legacy auto chip supply/demand
