# Designer jewelry

Independent fine jewelry brands outside the major conglomerates. Positioned between costume jewelry and high jewelry houses (Cartier, Van Cleef). Often founder-led, emphasizing craft, distinctive aesthetic, and accessible luxury price points ($200-$5,000).

## Business model

**What differentiates from conglomerates:**
- Founder-led creative vision
- Smaller production runs, artisanal positioning
- DTC + selective wholesale (Bergdorf, Net-a-Porter)
- No licensing, maintain brand control
- Often self-funded or modest PE backing

**Economics:**
- Higher margins than fashion jewelry (precious metals, craftsmanship)
- Lower marketing spend than conglomerates
- Flagship stores in key markets (NYC, LA, London)

## Distribution

| Channel | Role |
|---------|------|
| Own retail | Flagships for brand experience |
| E-commerce | Growing, especially post-COVID |
| Bergdorf Goodman | Key wholesale partner for designer segment |
| Net-a-Porter | Global luxury e-commerce |
| Specialty jewelers | Independent fine jewelry stores |

## Trends

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Gender-neutral designs** | Spinelli Kilcollin, broader appeal |
| **Everyday luxury** | Jewelry for daily wear, not occasions |
| **Stacking/layering** | Multiple pieces = higher ticket |
| **DTC growth** | Margin capture, customer data |
| **Celebrity seeding** | Organic visibility without paid endorsement |

## Investment notes

Most remain private. Potential exits include:
- Acquisition by conglomerate (LVMH, Kering, Richemont)
- Private equity roll-up
- Strategic acquisition by department store groups

Alexis Bittar's path (sold to Brooks Brothers → reacquired post-bankruptcy) shows risks of conglomerate ownership for founder-driven brands.
