**Real estate cycles** — Recurring pattern of boom-bust in property markets. Historically ~18 years from peak to peak. Driven by fixed land supply capturing gains from economic expansion, followed by speculation and credit excess.

## The 18-year cycle

**Discovery:** Homer Hoyt documented in "100 Years of Land Values in Chicago" (1933) that US real estate follows ~18-year cycles since 1800.

**Structure:** Phil Anderson and Fred Harrison refined the model:
- **14 years up** — expansion, acceleration, speculation
- **4 years down** — bust, deleveraging, recovery

**Historical consistency:** Cycle has ranged 17-21 years with only two major interruptions:
1. World War II
2. 1979 Fed rate shock (mid-cycle)

## Historical peaks

| Peak | Trough | Duration | Trigger |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1818 | 1820s | ~18 yrs | Land speculation (frontier) |
| 1836 | 1840s | ~18 yrs | Canal/railroad speculation |
| 1857 | 1860s | ~21 yrs | Railroad expansion |
| 1873 | 1870s | ~16 yrs | Post-Civil War boom |
| 1893 | 1890s | ~20 yrs | Railroad overbuilding |
| 1907 | 1910s | ~14 yrs | Trust company crisis |
| 1926 | 1930s | ~19 yrs | Florida land boom |
| 1973 | 1975 | ~18 yrs | REIT crisis, oil shock |
| 1989-90 | 1992 | ~17 yrs | S&L crisis, commercial RE |
| 2006-07 | 2011-12 | ~17 yrs | Subprime, GFC |

## Foldvary's 2008 prediction

Fred Foldvary wrote in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology (1997):

> "The next major bust, 18 years after the 1990 downturn, will be around 2008, if there is no major interruption such as a global war."

Predicted the 2008 crisis 11 years in advance using cycle analysis.

## Where are we now?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last trough | 2011-2012 |
| Current year | 2026 |
| Years into cycle | ~14 |
| Cycle theory peak | ~2026-2029 |

**Harrison's forecast:** House prices peak around 2026.

**Caveat:** Cycles are patterns, not guarantees. Interest rates, policy, global events can accelerate or delay.

## Why the cycle repeats

**Mechanism:**
1. **Fixed land supply** — can't make more land
2. **Economic expansion** → rising land values → land rent captures gains
3. **Speculation** — buyers expect prices to keep rising
4. **Credit expansion** — banks lend against rising collateral
5. **Affordability crisis** — prices outpace wages
6. **Demand collapse** → prices crash → banks tighten → recession
7. **Prices bottom** → cycle restarts

**Root cause:** Henry George (1876) identified land's fixed supply as the fundamental driver. Land rent rises with prosperity, eventually choking off the economy.

## Sector-specific cycles

Different RE sectors have their own dynamics layered on the 18-year macro cycle:

| Sector | Typical cycle | Current phase (2025-26) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Residential** | 18-year | Late expansion |
| **Multifamily** | 5-7 year supply | Supply peak absorbing |
| **Office** | 10-15 year | Structural decline (WFH) |
| **Retail** | Varies | E-commerce disruption |
| **Industrial** | 5-7 year | Strong (logistics demand) |
| **Hotels** | Highly cyclical | Recovering post-COVID |

See [[Multifamily housing]], [[Hotel industry]] for sector detail.

## Investment implications

**Late-cycle positioning (year 12-16):**
- Reduce leverage
- Sell illiquid assets
- Build cash for post-bust opportunities
- Avoid peak-cycle acquisitions (see [[Lightstone Group]] Extended Stay)

**Post-bust positioning (year 1-4):**
- Deploy cash into distressed assets
- Lock in long-term financing
- Contrarian opportunity in hardest-hit sectors

---

## Extended Stay case study

[[David Lichtenstein]] bought Extended Stay Hotels for $8B in June 2007 (year 15-16 of cycle) with $7B debt. Two years later: Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

**Lessons:**
1. Peak-cycle acquisitions = maximum risk
2. Leverage amplifies cycle losses
3. "Bad boy" clauses can mean personal liability
4. Lichtenstein recovered — but took a decade

## Insights

- **18 years is remarkably consistent** — works because land supply is fixed while credit cycles are ~18 years
- **Predictions work** — Foldvary called 2008 from 1997; cycle theorists point to ~2026 for current peak
- **Leverage is the killer** — cycles are survivable without debt; leverage turns downturns into wipeouts
- **Sector timing varies** — multifamily supply cycle (5-7 years) operates within the macro 18-year cycle
