**[[EU]] Chips Act** — €43B European semiconductor initiative. Goal: 20% global chip production by 2030 (from ~10% today).

---

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total investment | €43B (~$47B) |
| Public funding | €11B |
| Private mobilization | €32B target |
| Timeline | 2023-2030 |
| Goal | 20% global production share |

**Current [[EU]] share:** ~10% of global semiconductor production (down from 44% in 1990).

---

## Three pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Funding |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Chips for Europe** | R&D, design capabilities | €3.3B |
| **Supply security** | Fabs, production capacity | €6B+ |
| **Monitoring & crisis** | Supply chain coordination | Regulatory |

---

## Key projects

| Project | Company | Location | Investment | Nodes |
|---------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| Dresden fab | [[Intel]] | [[Germany]] | €30B | Advanced |
| Dresden expansion | [[TSMC]] + partners | [[Germany]] | €10B | 28/12nm |
| Crolles expansion | [[STMicro]] + [[GlobalFoundries]] | [[France]] | €7.5B | FD-SOI |
| Catania SiC | [[STMicro]] | Italy | €2B | Silicon carbide |
| Magdeburg | [[Intel]] | [[Germany]] | €30B | **On hold** |

**Intel Magdeburg:** Originally flagship project, now paused due to Intel's financial struggles. Major setback for [[EU]] ambitions.

---

## National programs

| Country | Program | Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **[[Germany]]** | €20B+ subsidies | Intel, TSMC fabs |
| **[[France]]** | [[France]] 2030 | STMicro, sovereignty |
| **Netherlands** | Brainport | ASML ecosystem |
| **Italy** | €4B+ | STMicro SiC |

---

## Strategic rationale

| Driver | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| **Supply chain** | COVID shortages, [[Taiwan]] risk |
| **[[Automotive]]** | [[EU]] autos need chips, [[China]] EV threat |
| **Sovereignty** | Reduce US/[[Asia]] dependence |
| **[[Defense]]** | Strategic autonomy |

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Intel delays | Magdeburg on hold, credibility hit |
| Scale vs [[Asia]] | [[EU]] fabs still smaller than TSMC/[[Samsung]] |
| Talent shortage | Not enough engineers |
| Energy costs | Higher than [[Asia]]/US |
| Fragmentation | 27 countries, coordination issues |
| Leading edge | No EUV fabs planned (only ASML makes equipment) |

---

## Investment implications

**Beneficiaries:**
- [[ASML]] — Equipment for any European fabs
- [[STMicro]] — French/Italian champion, subsidies
- [[Infineon]] — German power semi leader
- Construction/infrastructure — Fab buildouts

**Risks:**
- Intel project delays hurt sentiment
- Subsidies may not translate to competitiveness
- Still dependent on TSMC for leading edge

---

## Comparison to peers

| Program | Size | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| **US [[CHIPS Act]]** | $52B | Leading edge, national security |
| **[[EU]] Chips Act** | €43B | [[Automotive]], sovereignty |
| **[[Japan]]** | $13B+ | [[Rapidus]] 2nm, TSMC fab |
| **Korea** | $450B (private) | [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]] expansion |
| **[[China]]** | $150B+ | Self-sufficiency |
