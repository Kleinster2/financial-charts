[[TSMC]]'s lock-in operates on two levels: **technical integration** and **capacity allocation**.

---

## Technical lock-in

- Apple, NVIDIA, AMD design chips around [[TSMC]]'s [[Process design kit|PDKs]]
- Engineers learn timing models, quirks, and design constraints over years
- This knowledge doesn't transfer to [[Samsung]] or [[Intel Foundry Services]]

**Example: Apple A19 (Dec 2025)**
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node only gave 4% — rest from design (2x cache density, layout efficiency)
- Years of Apple-TSMC co-optimization enabled gains beyond what the node delivers
- Competitors can't replicate this accumulated knowledge

## Ecosystem reinforcement

- EDA tools (Synopsys, Cadence) calibrated to TSMC first
- IP libraries from Arm validated on TSMC before competitors
- Switching requires re-verifying entire design flows

---

## Capacity lock-in

The biggest customers don't just choose TSMC — they **pre-book capacity**, squeezing out smaller players.

- Apple and NVIDIA have locked [[TSMC]] 2nm supply (Dec 2025)
- AMD, Google, Qualcomm forced to look elsewhere
- This is why AMD is talking to [[Samsung]] despite 40% yields — not because Samsung is good enough, but because TSMC is **full**

## Implication

[[TSMC]]'s moat isn't just "better yields" — it's:
1. Deep integration into customer workflows (technical)
2. Capacity scarcity that forces second-tier customers to competitors (allocation)

A competitor benefits not by being better than TSMC, but by being **available** when TSMC isn't.
