**Europium** — The red phosphor rare earth. Essential for displays, night vision, and emerging quantum technologies. 95%+ [[China]]-controlled. Smaller market than [[Dysprosium]] but potential quantum computing catalyst.

---

## Why europium matters

Europium produces pure red and blue luminescent colors — irreplaceable for color-accurate displays.

| Application | Share of demand | Use |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| Display phosphors | 45% | TVs, smartphones, monitors |
| Lighting systems | 15% | LEDs, fluorescent |
| Quantum technologies | 10% | Quantum dots, emerging |
| [[Defense]] | 10% | Night vision, targeting |
| Other | 20% | Anti-counterfeiting, medical |

---

## The physics

Europium's electron configuration enables:
- **Eu³⁺**: Red emission (611-615 nm) — the red in RGB
- **Eu²⁺**: Blue emission — LED phosphors

No other element produces these specific wavelengths with the same efficiency.

---

## Market size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global consumption | 400-500 tons/year |
| vs [[Dysprosium]] | ~5x smaller |
| Growth rate | 8-12% annually (displays) |
| Price | ~$30-50/kg oxide |

Small market, but high value and no substitutes for premium applications.

---

## [[China]] dominance

| Stage | [[China]] share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | ~90% |
| Processing | ~95% |
| End products | ~95% |

**Vulnerability**: [[India]] imports 95% of rare earth needs from [[China]]. US/[[EU]] similar dependency for europium specifically.

## Applications deep dive

### Displays (45% of demand)

| Technology | Europium role |
|------------|---------------|
| LCD | Red phosphor in backlight |
| OLED | Less dependent (organic emitters) |
| Quantum dot | Eu-doped QDs for wide color gamut |
| MicroLED | Phosphor conversion layers |

**Trend**: OLED reduces europium intensity per display, but quantum dots increase it. Net effect: continued demand growth.

### Night vision (defense)

| System | Europium use |
|--------|--------------|
| NVGs (night vision goggles) | Phosphor screen |
| Targeting displays | Color rendering |
| HUDs | Cockpit displays |

Europium + yttrium + terbium create the green-hued visibility in military night vision.

### [[Quantum computing]] (emerging)

| Application | Potential |
|-------------|-----------|
| Quantum dots | Color purity |
| Qubits | Research stage |
| Quantum sensors | Emerging |

Currently 5% of demand, but potential 1000% growth if quantum computing scales. Could transform europium from specialty chemical to strategic resource.

## 2025 export controls

Europium was added to [[China]]'s October 2025 rare earth restrictions:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Oct 9, 2025 | Europium added to export license requirements |
| Nov 7, 2025 | Controls suspended for 1 year |

## Europium vs Dysprosium

| Aspect | Europium | [[Dysprosium]] |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Primary use | Displays, phosphors | EV magnets |
| Crisis level | Watch | Critical |
| Market size | 400-500 t/year | ~2,000 t/year |
| Substitutes | Partial (OLED) | None |
| Growth driver | Quantum (speculative) | EVs (certain) |
| [[Defense]] use | Night vision | Guidance, motors |

**Dysprosium** is a crisis today. **Europium** could become one if quantum computing scales.

## Investment implications

**Current exposure:**
- Display panel manufacturers
- Night vision/defense optics
- LED lighting (declining)

**Future catalyst:**
- [[Quantum computing]] adoption
- Quantum dot TV proliferation
- Premium display demand

**Watch for:**
- [[Quantum computing]] commercialization timeline
- [[China]] export policy changes
- OLED vs quantum dot market share
