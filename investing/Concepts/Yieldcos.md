## How yieldcos work

```
Sponsor (Developer)              Yieldco (Public)
       │                               │
  Develops projects    ──────────►   Owns operating assets
  Takes construction risk  "dropdown"  Collects contracted revenue
       │                               │
  Gets capital back                Pays dividends (5-7%)
  Builds more projects              Low risk, predictable
```

**The deal:** Sponsor offloads completed assets → gets capital for new projects. Investors get stable income.

## Major yieldcos

| Company | Ticker | Sponsor | Yield | Assets |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| [[Brookfield Renewable]] | BEP/BEPC | Brookfield | ~5% | 35 GW, hydro-heavy |
| [[Clearway]] | CWEN | GIP/BlackRock | ~6% | 9 GW, wind/solar/gas |
| NextEra Energy Partners | NEP | NextEra | ~6% | Wind/solar |
| Atlantica Yield | AY | Algonquin | ~7% | Renewables + water |
| Hannon Armstrong | HASI | Self-sponsored | ~6% | Climate investments |

## AI/Data center relevance

**Why yieldcos matter for AI power thesis:**

| Connection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Hyperscaler PPAs | Long-term contracts with Google, Microsoft, Amazon |
| Scale | Can meet large data center demand |
| 24/7 clean energy | Hydro provides baseload |
| Predictable supply | Contracted = reliable |

**Trend:** Hyperscalers signing PPAs with yieldcos for carbon-free power.

## Yieldco vs developer vs utility

| Type | Example | Risk | Yield | Growth |
|------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| **Yieldco** | Clearway | Low | High | Moderate |
| Developer | First Solar | Higher | Low/none | Higher |
| Utility | NextEra | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

Yieldcos = income play. Developers = growth play.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Predictable, contracted cash flows
- High dividend yields
- Clean energy tailwinds
- Hyperscaler demand growing
- Inflation protection (some contracts)

**Bear:**
- Interest rate sensitivity (competes with bonds)
- Sponsor conflicts (dropdown pricing)
- Contract expiration/recontracting risk
- Complex structures
- Limited upside vs growth stocks

---

## Interest rate sensitivity

**Yieldcos trade like bonds:**
- Higher rates → lower yieldco prices
- Lower rates → higher yieldco prices

**2022-2023:** Rising rates crushed yieldco valuations.

**Watch:** Fed policy, 10-year Treasury yields.

## Sponsor relationship

**Benefits:**
- Deal flow (new assets to acquire)
- Development expertise
- Capital support

**Risks:**
- Conflicts of interest (dropdown pricing)
- Sponsor financial health matters
- Sponsor could prioritize itself
