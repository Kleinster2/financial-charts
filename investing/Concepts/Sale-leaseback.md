# Sale-Leaseback

**Sell your building, rent it back** — a financing structure where a company sells property it owns and immediately leases it back from the buyer. Converts fixed assets into cash while maintaining occupancy.

## How it works

```
Before:  Company owns building, operates in it
         ↓
Sale:    Company sells building to investor/REIT
         ↓
Leaseback: Company signs long-term lease with new owner
         ↓
After:   Company has cash, pays rent, no longer owns building
```

| Party | Gets | Gives up |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Seller/tenant** | Immediate cash | Ownership, future appreciation |
| **Buyer/landlord** | Stable rental income, property | Capital |

## Economics

### For the seller (retailer)

| Benefit | Trade-off |
|---------|-----------|
| Immediate liquidity | Lose ownership |
| Debt reduction | Now pay rent (operating expense) |
| Balance sheet improvement | No future appreciation |
| Focus on operations | Landlord controls property |

### For the buyer (investor/REIT)

| Benefit | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Predictable rental income | Tenant credit risk |
| Long-term lease (10-25 years) | Property may decline in value |
| Trophy asset | Retail structural decline |
| Below-market acquisition (distress) | Re-leasing risk at expiration |

---

## Typical terms

| Term | Range |
|------|-------|
| Lease length | 10-25 years |
| Rent escalations | 1-3% annually or CPI |
| Renewal options | Multiple 5-year options |
| Cap rate | 5-8% (varies by credit, location) |
| Triple-net (NNN) | Tenant pays taxes, insurance, maintenance |

**Cap rate math:**
```
Sale price = Annual rent ÷ Cap rate
$100M rent at 6% cap = $1.67B sale price
```

## Why retailers use sale-leasebacks

### 1. Unlock trapped capital

Many retailers own real estate worth more than their market cap. Sale-leaseback converts illiquid assets to cash.

| Company | Real estate value | Market cap | Gap |
|---------|------------------|------------|-----|
| [[Macy's]] | $5-9B (estimated) | ~$5.8B | Potential unlock |
| Kohl's | ~$8B (2022 estimate) | ~$3B | Significant |

### 2. Reduce debt / avoid bankruptcy

Distressed retailers can raise cash without traditional financing:
- Sears sold stores to Seritage Growth Properties
- JCPenney explored sale-leasebacks pre-bankruptcy

### 3. Activist pressure

Investors often push retailers to "unlock real estate value":
- Starboard at Macy's (2015): Proposed flagship sale-leaseback
- Barington/Thor at Macy's (2024): Pushed real estate separation

## The Saks counter-example

[[Richard Baker]] explicitly **rejected** sale-leaseback for the [[611 Fifth Avenue]] flagship:

| What Baker did | What sale-leaseback would have done |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Kept ownership of land + building | Sold building, leased back |
| Took $1.25B [[ground lease]] mortgage | Would have raised $2-3B+ cash |
| Retained appreciation upside | Lost appreciation to buyer |
| Building available as future collateral | No asset left to pledge |

**Baker's thesis:** The flagship would appreciate, and ownership was more valuable than immediate cash. He was right about appreciation ($1.6B → $3.6B) but wrong about the operating business surviving.

**The irony:** In [[Saks bankruptcy]], the flagship Baker kept became [[DIP financing]] collateral. If he'd done a sale-leaseback in 2014, there would have been no asset to pledge — but also $2B+ more cash to weather the storm.

## Sale-leaseback vs. other structures

| Structure | Ownership | Cash raised | Future flexibility |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sale-leaseback** | Sold | Highest | Lowest (tenant only) |
| **Mortgage** | Retained | Medium | Medium (can refinance) |
| **[[Ground lease]]** | Split | Medium | Complex |
| **JV with REIT** | Partial | Medium | Shared control |

---

## Notable retail sale-leasebacks

| Company | Deal | Outcome |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Sears** | Sold 235 stores to Seritage (2015) | Seritage struggled; Sears bankrupt anyway |
| **Walgreens** | Multiple portfolio sales | Ongoing; funds expansion |
| **CVS** | Regular sale-leaseback program | Funds acquisitions |
| **Kohl's** | Explored 2022, rejected activist plan | Kept ownership |

**Cautionary tale:** Sears raised $2.7B from Seritage sale-leaseback (2015) but still went bankrupt (2018). The cash bought time, not survival.

## Investment implications

**For retailers:**
- Sale-leaseback is a **last resort** monetization — gives up long-term value for short-term liquidity
- Works best when real estate is undervalued vs. operating business
- Often signals distress

**For REITs/buyers:**
- Retail sale-leasebacks carry [[Department store decline]] risk
- Tenant credit quality is paramount
- Re-leasing large boxes is difficult if tenant fails

**For investors watching retailers:**
- Sale-leaseback announcements can signal either financial engineering (bullish) or desperation (bearish)
- Compare sale price to intrinsic real estate value — is retailer selling cheap?
