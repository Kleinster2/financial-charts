# Port automation

The shift from manual to automated container handling at ports, driven by labor costs, efficiency gains, and throughput demands. China leads globally with 18 operational automated terminals and 27 under construction (Nov 2024).

## Why It Matters

Automated ports are:
- **Faster**: Dual-trolley quay cranes increase efficiency 50%+ vs single-trolley
- **24/7 capable**: No shift changes, fatigue, or labor disputes
- **Safer**: Fewer accidents from heavy equipment
- **Strategic**: Chokepoint control for global trade

## Key Technologies

| Component | Function | Leader |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Automated quay cranes | Ship-to-shore loading | [[ZPMC]] |
| Rail-mounted gantry cranes | Yard stacking | [[ZPMC]], Kalmar |
| Automated guided vehicles | Horizontal transport | [[ZPMC]], Konecranes |
| Terminal operating systems | Orchestration software | Navis, [[Alibaba]] Cloud |
| 5G connectivity | Real-time control | [[Huawei]] |

## Global Landscape

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| China | 18 automated terminals, 27 more building |
| US | Heavy reliance on [[ZPMC]] cranes (~80%); now investing in alternatives |
| Europe | Rotterdam, Hamburg automated; Liebherr/Kalmar equipment |
| Middle East | Jebel Ali, Khalifa expanding automation |

## Yangshan as Benchmark

[[SIPG]]'s Yangshan Phase IV is the reference implementation:
- $2.15B investment
- First port to exceed 50M TEU/year
- Full ZPMC equipment suite
- Blockchain cargo tracking (with [[Alibaba]])

## Security Dimension

Automated ports introduce cybersecurity risk:
- Remote-controllable cranes can be shut down
- China-made equipment dominates globally
- US Congressional investigation (2024) flagged [[ZPMC]] cranes as potential vulnerability
- US investing in domestic alternatives

This creates tension: automation is economically superior but may create strategic dependency.

## Investment Implications

**Beneficiaries:**
- [[ZPMC]] — dominant equipment supplier
- [[SIPG]] — operator of world's most automated port
- 5G/cloud providers serving ports (Huawei, Alibaba)

**At risk:**
- Manual terminal operators facing cost disadvantage
- Western equipment makers losing share
- Ports slow to automate

**Watch for:**
- US/EU policies on critical infrastructure sourcing
- Labor union responses to automation
- Cyber incidents at automated ports
