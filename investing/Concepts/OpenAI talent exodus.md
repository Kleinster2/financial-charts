**OpenAI Talent Exodus** — Top researchers leaving OpenAI, starting competitors. Follow the talent.

## The thesis

OpenAI's best people are leaving to build:

| Person | Left OpenAI | Started/Joined | Valuation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| [[Ilya Sutskever]] | May 2024 | [[SSI]] | $32B |
| [[Mira Murati]] | Sept 2024 | [[Thinking Machines Lab]] | $12B |
| [[John Schulman]] | Aug 2024 | TML (via Anthropic) | — |
| [[Jan Leike]] | May 2024 | [[Anthropic]] | — |

---

## Why they're leaving

| Cited reason | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| Safety concerns | OpenAI deprioritizing |
| Commercial pressure | Research → products |
| Culture change | [[Microsoft]] influence |
| Founder opportunity | Build own vision |
| Equity upside | New company = more upside |

Jan Leike: "Safety has taken a backseat to shiny products."

---

## Where they're going

| Destination | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| [[SSI]] | Safe Superintelligence (Sutskever) |
| [[Thinking Machines Lab]] | Fine-tuning/reasoning (Murati) |
| [[Anthropic]] | Safety-first (Leike) |
| Independent | Education ([[Andrej Karpathy]]) |

---

## Valuation signal

**Talent = value:**
- SSI: $32B with ~20 employees, no product
- TML: $12B, $2B seed round
- Market paying for talent alone

---

## Investment implications

**Long talent destinations:**
- [[Anthropic]] — safety researchers
- SSI, TML — when/if they go public

**OpenAI questions:**
- Talent drain sustainable?
- Culture concerns real
- Execution risk rising

**[[Meta]]-thesis:**
- AI talent = scarce resource
- Follow the researchers
- New labs = next opportunities

---

## The Anthropic pipeline

**OpenAI → Anthropic:**
- Dario Amodei (founder)
- Daniela Amodei (founder)
- Jan Leike (2024)
- Multiple researchers

Anthropic = OpenAI's safety-focused spinout.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SSI valuation | $32B (~20 employees) |
| TML seed round | $2B |
| Key departures | Sutskever, Murati, Leike |
| Pattern | Safety concerns cited |
