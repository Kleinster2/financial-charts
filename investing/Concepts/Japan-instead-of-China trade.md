# Japan-instead-of-China trade

A structural reallocation of institutional capital from [[China]] to [[Japan]] that accelerated in 2023-2026. Multi-billion dollar pension funds from North America and Europe have shifted Asia allocations toward Tokyo as China faces compounding headwinds (demographics, regulatory crackdowns, property crisis, geopolitical risk) while Japan offers governance reform, reflation, and political stability.

## The push (out of China)

- **Regulatory risk**: Xi's 2021 tech crackdowns (Alibaba, Didi, education) destroyed investor trust overnight
- **Property crisis**: [[Evergrande]], Country Garden defaults → systemic wealth destruction
- **Demographics**: China's working-age population declining faster than Japan's did
- **Geopolitical risk**: Taiwan tensions, US-China decoupling, sanctions risk on holdings
- **Capital controls**: difficulty repatriating profits, opaque regulatory environment
- **GPIF signal**: Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund ($1.7T, world's largest) switched its foreign equity benchmark to **exclude onshore Chinese shares** (Apr 2025) — massive institutional signal

## The pull (into Japan)

- [[Japan corporate governance revolution]]: TSE reforms driving ROE improvement, buybacks, cross-shareholding unwinding
- **Reflation**: 30-year deflation ending → nominal GDP growth returns
- **[[Sanae Takaichi]]** landslide: political stability + pro-growth fiscal policy
- **[[Warren Buffett]]** endorsement: [[Buffett Japan sogo shosha trade]] legitimized Japan for allocators
- **Valuation**: Nikkei at 16.2x P/E — cheaper than S&P 500 with improving fundamentals
- **Rule of law**: transparent regulatory environment, no expropriation risk
- **Currency opportunity**: weak yen (156-158/$) makes Japanese assets cheap in dollar terms

## Scale

- North American and European pension funds moving from tactical to **core long-term** Japan allocations
- Japan-focused hedge funds surging — Q2 2025 saw $7.6B in Asia-Pacific investment flows favoring Japan
- DXJ (yen-hedged Japan ETF) returned ~35% in 2025, attracting massive inflows
- [[BlackRock]] analysts call it a "structural re-rating that is only just beginning"

## The mirror image

| Factor | China | Japan |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Demographics | Declining (faster) | Declining (slower, better managed) |
| Governance | State-directed, opaque | Reforming toward shareholder value |
| Property | Crisis/deflation | Stable, reflating |
| Capital markets | Regulatory risk, VIE structures | TSE reforms, transparency |
| Geopolitics | Sanctionable, decoupling target | US ally, trade deal (Jul 2025) |
| Valuation | "Uninvestable" discount | Catch-up re-rating |

## Risks to the trade

- China stimulus surprise could reverse flows rapidly (as seen briefly in Sep 2024 when PBOC eased)
- Japan's reform could stall at the small-cap level
- Yen strengthening would hurt DXJ returns and reduce the "cheap Japan" argument
- Crowded trade risk — "everyone is long Japan" narrative building
