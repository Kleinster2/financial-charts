**AI fiber supercycle** — Explosive growth in fiber-optic demand driven by AI data center buildout. Hyperscalers signing multi-billion dollar, multi-year supply deals with optical infrastructure providers.

---

## Why AI drives fiber demand

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Data center interconnects** | AI clusters require massive bandwidth between nodes |
| **GPU-to-GPU communication** | Training requires low-latency, high-throughput links |
| **Scale of buildout** | Hyperscalers spending $200B+/year on capex |
| **Geographic distribution** | Long-haul fiber connecting data center campuses |
| **Redundancy requirements** | Multiple fiber paths for reliability |

**Key insight:** Every new AI data center needs fiber. More compute = more interconnect = more fiber.

## Landmark deals

| Date | Customer | Supplier | Value | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Jan 2026** | [[Meta]] | [[Corning]] | **$6B** | Through 2030 |
| 2025 | [[Microsoft]] | Lumen | Multi-billion | Multi-year |
| 2025 | [[Google]] | Various | — | Ongoing |
| 2025 | [[Amazon]] | Various | — | Ongoing |

The Meta-Corning deal ($6B through 2030) is the clearest signal of the supercycle — hyperscalers locking in supply.

## Corning as bellwether

[[Corning]] Optical Communications segment:
- **Q3 2025:** $1.65B revenue, **+33% YoY**
- Meta deal: Up to $6B through 2030
- CEO: Hyperscalers are "most critical growth engine"
- Stock +123% YoY, hit ATH ($114) on deal news

**Corning's advantage:** 170+ years of glass/fiber innovation, sole source for many hyperscaler specs.

## Capacity constraints

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Fiber manufacturing** | Adding capacity (Corning expanding Hickory, NC) |
| **Specialty glass** | Long lead times |
| **Skilled labor** | Fiber installation workforce limited |
| **Raw materials** | Silica, specialty chemicals |

Multi-year contracts (like Meta-Corning) lock in supply amid tight capacity.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- AI capex still accelerating ($200B+/year hyperscaler spend)
- Multi-year contracts provide revenue visibility
- Picks-and-shovels play on AI without model risk
- Fiber demand scales linearly with compute buildout
- US manufacturing advantage (domestic production)

**Bear:**
- Cyclicality if AI capex slows
- Customer concentration (hyperscalers)
- Competition from Chinese fiber makers
- Overbuild risk if AI demand disappoints

## Metrics to watch

| Metric | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| Hyperscaler capex guidance | Leading indicator |
| Corning Optical segment growth | Demand proxy |
| Fiber pricing | Supply/demand balance |
| Long-term supply agreements | Commitment level |
| Data center construction starts | Forward demand |
