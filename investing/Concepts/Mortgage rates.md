## What drives mortgage rates

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **10-year Treasury yield** | Primary benchmark (~4%+ currently) |
| **Fed funds rate** | Indirect — influences short end |
| **MBS spreads** | Risk premium over Treasuries |
| **Inflation expectations** | Higher → higher rates |
| **Economic growth** | Stronger → higher rates |
| **Supply/demand** | Fed QT reducing MBS demand |

**Key relationship:** Mortgage rates ≈ 10-year Treasury + ~150-250 bps spread.

## Fed policy link

| Fed action | Mortgage rate impact |
|------------|---------------------|
| Rate cuts | Tends to lower (but not 1:1) |
| QT (balance sheet) | Raises spreads |
| Forward guidance | Shapes expectations |

**Dec 2025 Fed projections:** Median expectation is one 0.25% cut in 2026.

**Reality:** "Fed doesn't set mortgage rates directly, but its policies and market expectations strongly influence them."

## Historical context

| Period | 30-year rate | Context |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| 2021 (low) | ~3% | COVID stimulus, Fed QE |
| 2023 (peak) | ~8% | Inflation fight |
| Jan 2026 | 6.06% | Normalizing |
| Pre-2008 average | ~6-7% | "Normal" range |

**Don't expect 3-4% rates again:** "Economists don't anticipate a dip into the 3% or 4% range in the foreseeable future."

## Housing market impact

| Rate level | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Above 7%** | Severe affordability stress |
| **6-7%** | Elevated, lock-in effect |
| **5.5-6%** | Modest relief |
| **Below 5.5%** | Refi wave triggers |

**Lock-in effect:** Homeowners with sub-4% mortgages reluctant to sell/move.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Rate path | Housing impact |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Soft landing** | 5.5-6% | Modest improvement |
