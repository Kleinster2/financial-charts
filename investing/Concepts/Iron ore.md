#concept #commodity

Iron ore — the primary input for steelmaking and the world's second most traded commodity by volume after crude oil. Benchmark pricing is set by the 62% Fe fines index (Platts IODEX), delivered to Qingdao, [[China]].

## Why iron ore matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Benchmark | 62% Fe fines CFR [[China]] |
| 2024 seaborne trade | ~1.6 billion tonnes |
| Top producers | [[Vale]], [[Rio Tinto]], [[BHP]], [[Fortescue]] |
| Top consumer | [[China]] (~70% of seaborne imports) |
| Key end use | Steel (construction, infrastructure, manufacturing) |

## Pricing dynamics

Iron ore pricing is driven almost entirely by [[China]]'s steel sector. Property construction (historically ~30% of Chinese steel demand) has been in structural decline, but infrastructure spending and manufacturing partially offset. Each US$10/t price move has outsized impact on producer profits — [[Fortescue]]'s FY2025 showed an 18% price drop driving a 41% profit decline.

Grade matters: 62% Fe is the benchmark, but premium ores (65%+, like [[Vale]]'s Carajas) command a premium while lower-grade ores (57-58%, like some [[Fortescue]] products) trade at a discount. The grade spread widens in weak markets and narrows in strong ones.

## Supply landscape

| Producer | Annual output | Key region |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| [[Vale]] | ~336 Mt | Brazil (Carajas, Minas Gerais) |
| [[Rio Tinto]] | ~330 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |
| [[BHP]] | ~290 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |
| [[Fortescue]] | ~198 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |

Simandou (Guinea) — a 120 Mtpa high-grade project backed by [[Rio Tinto]] and Chinese consortium — could reshape the supply curve when it reaches full production.
