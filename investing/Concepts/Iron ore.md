Iron ore — the primary input for steelmaking and the world's second most traded commodity by volume after crude oil. Benchmark pricing is set by the 62% Fe fines index (Platts IODEX), delivered to Qingdao, [[China]].

## Why iron ore matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Benchmark | 62% Fe fines CFR [[China]] |
| 2024 seaborne trade | ~1.6 billion tonnes |
| Top producers | [[Vale]], [[Rio Tinto]], [[BHP]], [[Fortescue]] |
| Top consumer | [[China]] (~70% of seaborne imports) |
| Key end use | Steel (construction, infrastructure, manufacturing) |

## Iron ore price (62% Fe futures, since 2020)

![[iron-ore-price-chart.png]]
*Peaked above $220/t in mid-2021 during the post-COVID supercycle, then ground lower as [[China]]'s property sector declined. Currently ~$101/t — less than half the 2021 highs. A modest bounce from mid-2025 lows (~$88/t) reflects restocking and stimulus hopes, but the structural downtrend remains intact.*

## Pricing dynamics

Iron ore pricing is driven almost entirely by [[China]]'s steel sector. Property construction (historically ~30% of Chinese steel demand) has been in structural decline, but infrastructure spending and manufacturing partially offset. Each US$10/t price move has outsized impact on producer profits — [[Fortescue]]'s FY2025 showed an 18% price drop driving a 41% profit decline.

Grade matters: 62% Fe is the benchmark, but premium ores (65%+, like [[Vale]]'s Carajas) command a premium while lower-grade ores (57-58%, like some [[Fortescue]] products) trade at a discount. The grade spread widens in weak markets and narrows in strong ones.

## 2026 outlook — weak prices, strong miners

Iron ore prices remain structurally weak — ~$101/t in February 2026, less than half the 2021 peak. [[China]]'s property sector (historically ~30% of steel demand) continues declining. ING forecasts iron ore averaging $95/t for 2026, with long-term consensus drifting toward $78/t by 2034. Simandou ramps to 40-50 Mt in 2027, adding high-grade supply.

Modest bounce from mid-2025 lows (~$88/t) reflects:
- [[China]]'s January 2026 consumption-focused stimulus (EVs, batteries, renewables require specialized steel)
- Mill inventories below historical levels, creating restocking demand
- Australian and Brazilian shipments dipped, tightening seaborne supply
- Non-property steel demand now 72% of [[China]]'s total (more resilient base)

Despite weak iron ore prices, all three major miners rallied sharply — [[BHP]] re-rated, [[Rio Tinto]] +47% in 2025, [[Vale]] +82% 52-week. MSCI Metals & Mining Index surged ~90% since start of 2025, beating semis, banks, and the Mag 7. The common thread is [[Copper]], not iron ore. Copper broke out to ~$6/lb in early 2026 (nearly tripled from 2020), driven by US tariff stockpiling, AI/data center demand (475 kt in 2026), and supply disruptions (Grasberg force majeure, Chile grade declines). All three miners are growing copper exposure: BHP at ~45% of EBITDA post-OZ Minerals, Rio at ~15% with Oyu Tolgoi ramping to 500 ktpa, Vale targeting 900 kt/year with a VBM IPO to unlock value.

Company-specific catalysts layered on top: Rio's Arcadium lithium acquisition + [[Glencore]] merger talks (collapsed Feb 2026), Vale's dam settlement clearing + record operational execution (all three commodities beat guidance highs in 2025), BHP's OZ Minerals integration. [[China]]'s 15th Five-Year Plan (Oct 2025) pivoted from real estate to advanced manufacturing/EVs/renewables, shifting the demand mix for steel and copper. All three trading at 12-13x forward P/E vs 16x industry despite the rally — valuations still cheap relative to strategic relevance.

## Supply landscape

| Producer | Annual output | Key region |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| [[Vale]] | ~336 Mt | Brazil (Carajas, Minas Gerais) |
| [[Rio Tinto]] | ~330 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |
| [[BHP]] | ~290 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |
| [[Fortescue]] | ~198 Mt | Pilbara, Western [[Australia]] |

Simandou (Guinea) — a 120 Mtpa high-grade project backed by [[Rio Tinto]] and Chinese consortium — could reshape the supply curve when it reaches full production.
