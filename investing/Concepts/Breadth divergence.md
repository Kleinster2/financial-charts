# Breadth divergence

#concept #markets #technical #indicator

**Breadth divergence** — When market indexes and breadth indicators move in opposite directions. A leading indicator of trend reversals. Divergences in 2000 and 2007 preceded major bear markets by months. Core tool for distinguishing rotation from selloff.

## The family: breadth, dispersion, rotation, divergence

These terms get used interchangeably but measure different things.

**Breadth** is the parent concept — *how many stocks are participating?* Everything below is either a measure of breadth or a pattern that emerges from it.

**Advance/Decline (A/D)** is the simplest breadth indicator — counting how many stocks went up vs down. Binary: up or down, regardless of magnitude. The cumulative A/D line tracks this over time.

**[[Single stock dispersion|Dispersion]]** is fundamentally different. It measures *how far* stocks move, not *how many*. You can have high breadth (most stocks rising) with low dispersion (all rising ~2%) or high breadth with high dispersion (some up 25%, others down 30%, but more winners than losers).

**Divergence** is a pattern, not a metric — what happens when breadth and the index disagree. Index making new highs while the A/D line makes lower highs = bearish divergence. It's a warning signal, not a market regime.

**[[Sector rotation|Rotation]]** is the mechanism that *produces* the breadth and dispersion readings. Money leaving one sector and entering another shows up as high dispersion (big moves both ways) with decent breadth (more winners than losers) while the index stays flat.

**RSP** (Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF) is the trade expression. SPY is cap-weighted ([[Mega-cap tech acronyms|Mag 7]] ≈ 30%), RSP weights every stock equally. RSP vs SPY spread is the real-time scoreboard for breadth — when RSP outperforms, the average stock is beating the mega-caps.

### How they connect

```
Rotation (mechanism)
  → produces Breadth (participation) + Dispersion (magnitude)
    → measured by A/D line, % above MA, etc.
    → expressed via RSP vs SPY spread
    → Divergence = warning pattern when breadth contradicts index
```

### Feb 2026 regime

Rotation out of tech → high breadth (7/11 sectors up) → high dispersion (20%+ moves in 1/5 of stocks) → RSP outperforming SPY → **no bearish divergence** because breadth is *confirming* the underlying strength, not contradicting it. The index is flat not because of weakness but because of cap-weight math.

## The concept

**Breadth** = participation. How many stocks are rising vs falling.

**Divergence** = index and breadth moving opposite directions.

| Scenario | Index | Breadth | [[Signal]] |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Bearish divergence** | New highs | Lower highs | Top forming, narrow leadership |
| **Bullish divergence** | New lows | Higher lows | Bottom forming, accumulation |
| **Confirmation** | Rising | Rising | Healthy trend |
| **Rotation** | Falling | Rising | Leadership change, not selloff |

---

## Why it matters

**Indexes lie.** Cap-weighted indexes can rise on a handful of mega-caps while most stocks decline. Breadth reveals the truth underneath.

> "Through decades of market cycles, one pattern consistently stands out: deterioration in market breadth nearly always precedes tops in large-cap-weighted indexes."

**The mechanism:**
1. Late-cycle rallies narrow to fewer leaders
2. Index makes new highs, but fewer stocks participate
3. Breadth indicators diverge (lower highs)
4. Eventually price catches down to breadth

## Key indicators

### Advance/Decline Line (A/D Line)

**The "granddaddy" of breadth indicators.**

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Net Advances | Advancing stocks − Declining stocks |
| A/D Line | Cumulative sum of Net Advances |

**[[Signal]]:** A/D Line making lower highs while index makes higher highs = bearish divergence.

### McClellan Oscillator

Momentum indicator for breadth (like MACD for advances/declines).

| Reading | [[Signal]] |
|---------|--------|
| Above +50 | Strong breadth thrust |
| Below −50 | Oversold breadth |
| Cross zero | Momentum shift |
| +100 point surge | Breadth thrust (bullish) |

### Percent Above Moving Averages

| Indicator | Timeframe | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| % above 50 DMA | Short-medium term | >50% bullish, <50% bearish |
| % above 200 DMA | Long term | >50% bullish, <50% bearish |

**Divergence signal:** Index rising but % above 200 DMA falling = narrowing participation.

### New Highs vs New Lows

| Reading | [[Signal]] |
|---------|--------|
| Expanding new highs | Broad strength |
| Shrinking new highs (index up) | Bearish divergence |
| Expanding new lows | Broad weakness |
| Shrinking new lows (index down) | Bullish divergence |

## Historical warnings

| Year | Divergence | Lead time | What followed |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **2000** | A/D Line peaked before index | ~3 months | Dot-com crash (−49%) |
| **2007** | A/D Line lower highs Jul-Oct | ~3 months | GFC crash (−57%) |
| **2021** | Breadth peaked Nov 2021 | ~1 month | 2022 bear market (−25%) |

### The 2007 case study

**July 2007:** NYSE Composite at highs, A/D Line makes lower high → first warning

**October 2007:** Index surges to new highs, A/D Line well below July → second warning (double divergence)

**Result:** January 2008 support breaks, bear market begins.

> "2007 provided a near-picture perfect example of a breadth divergence with the S&P 500 making a clear higher high as both S&P and NYSE A-D Lines made lower highs."

## Rotation signature

**Distinct from bearish divergence:** In rotation, index falls but breadth is positive.

| Scenario | Index | Most stocks | Meaning |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Bearish divergence** | Up | Weakening | Top forming |
| **Rotation** | Down | Up | Leadership change |
| **Selloff** | Down | Down | Risk-off |

**Jan 14, 2026 example:** S&P 500 −0.53%, but 300+ constituents rose. [[Nasdaq]] −1.0%. This is rotation — money leaving Mag 7, spreading to rest of market. Not a selloff.

See [[Sector rotation]] for current rotation dynamics.

## How to use

### For timing

| [[Signal]] | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Index highs + breadth lower highs | Reduce risk, tighten stops |
| Index lows + breadth higher lows | Accumulate, anticipate reversal |
| Index down + breadth up | Rotation — reposition, don't flee |

### Warning signs checklist

- [ ] A/D Line making lower highs while index rises
- [ ] % above 200 DMA declining while index rises
- [ ] New highs shrinking while index rises
- [ ] McClellan Oscillator negative divergence
- [ ] Fewer sectors participating in rally

### False signals

**Not every divergence leads to crash:**
- Can resolve with breadth catching up
- Divergences can persist for months
- Works better at extremes

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Indicator | Reading | [[Signal]] |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Russell 2000 vs S&P | 9-day outperformance streak | Rotation underway |
| S&P 500 breadth (Jan 14) | 300+ up on down day | Healthy rotation |
| Mag 7 vs S&P 493 | Mag 7 lagging since Oct 2025 | Leadership broadening |

**Interpretation:** Not a bearish divergence (top forming) — this is rotation (leadership change). Breadth is improving as concentration decreases.
