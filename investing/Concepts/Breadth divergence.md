# Breadth divergence

#concept #markets #technical #indicator

**Breadth divergence** — When market indexes and breadth indicators move in opposite directions. A leading indicator of trend reversals. Divergences in 2000 and 2007 preceded major bear markets by months. Core tool for distinguishing rotation from selloff.

## The concept

**Breadth** = participation. How many stocks are rising vs falling.

**Divergence** = index and breadth moving opposite directions.

| Scenario | Index | Breadth | [[Signal]] |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Bearish divergence** | New highs | Lower highs | Top forming, narrow leadership |
| **Bullish divergence** | New lows | Higher lows | Bottom forming, accumulation |
| **Confirmation** | Rising | Rising | Healthy trend |
| **Rotation** | Falling | Rising | Leadership change, not selloff |

---

## Why it matters

**Indexes lie.** Cap-weighted indexes can rise on a handful of mega-caps while most stocks decline. Breadth reveals the truth underneath.

> "Through decades of market cycles, one pattern consistently stands out: deterioration in market breadth nearly always precedes tops in large-cap-weighted indexes."

**The mechanism:**
1. Late-cycle rallies narrow to fewer leaders
2. Index makes new highs, but fewer stocks participate
3. Breadth indicators diverge (lower highs)
4. Eventually price catches down to breadth

## Key indicators

### Advance/Decline Line (A/D Line)

**The "granddaddy" of breadth indicators.**

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Net Advances | Advancing stocks − Declining stocks |
| A/D Line | Cumulative sum of Net Advances |

**[[Signal]]:** A/D Line making lower highs while index makes higher highs = bearish divergence.

### McClellan Oscillator

Momentum indicator for breadth (like MACD for advances/declines).

| Reading | [[Signal]] |
|---------|--------|
| Above +50 | Strong breadth thrust |
| Below −50 | Oversold breadth |
| Cross zero | Momentum shift |
| +100 point surge | Breadth thrust (bullish) |

### Percent Above Moving Averages

| Indicator | Timeframe | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| % above 50 DMA | Short-medium term | >50% bullish, <50% bearish |
| % above 200 DMA | Long term | >50% bullish, <50% bearish |

**Divergence signal:** Index rising but % above 200 DMA falling = narrowing participation.

### New Highs vs New Lows

| Reading | [[Signal]] |
|---------|--------|
| Expanding new highs | Broad strength |
| Shrinking new highs (index up) | Bearish divergence |
| Expanding new lows | Broad weakness |
| Shrinking new lows (index down) | Bullish divergence |

## Historical warnings

| Year | Divergence | Lead time | What followed |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **2000** | A/D Line peaked before index | ~3 months | Dot-com crash (−49%) |
| **2007** | A/D Line lower highs Jul-Oct | ~3 months | GFC crash (−57%) |
| **2021** | Breadth peaked Nov 2021 | ~1 month | 2022 bear market (−25%) |

### The 2007 case study

**July 2007:** NYSE Composite at highs, A/D Line makes lower high → first warning

**October 2007:** Index surges to new highs, A/D Line well below July → second warning (double divergence)

**Result:** January 2008 support breaks, bear market begins.

> "2007 provided a near-picture perfect example of a breadth divergence with the S&P 500 making a clear higher high as both S&P and NYSE A-D Lines made lower highs."

## Rotation signature

**Distinct from bearish divergence:** In rotation, index falls but breadth is positive.

| Scenario | Index | Most stocks | Meaning |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Bearish divergence** | Up | Weakening | Top forming |
| **Rotation** | Down | Up | Leadership change |
| **Selloff** | Down | Down | Risk-off |

**Jan 14, 2026 example:** S&P 500 −0.53%, but 300+ constituents rose. [[Nasdaq]] −1.0%. This is rotation — money leaving Mag 7, spreading to rest of market. Not a selloff.

See [[Sector rotation]] for current rotation dynamics.

## How to use

### For timing

| [[Signal]] | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Index highs + breadth lower highs | Reduce risk, tighten stops |
| Index lows + breadth higher lows | Accumulate, anticipate reversal |
| Index down + breadth up | Rotation — reposition, don't flee |

### Warning signs checklist

- [ ] A/D Line making lower highs while index rises
- [ ] % above 200 DMA declining while index rises
- [ ] New highs shrinking while index rises
- [ ] McClellan Oscillator negative divergence
- [ ] Fewer sectors participating in rally

### False signals

**Not every divergence leads to crash:**
- Can resolve with breadth catching up
- Divergences can persist for months
- Works better at extremes

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Indicator | Reading | [[Signal]] |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Russell 2000 vs S&P | 9-day outperformance streak | Rotation underway |
| S&P 500 breadth (Jan 14) | 300+ up on down day | Healthy rotation |
| Mag 7 vs S&P 493 | Mag 7 lagging since Oct 2025 | Leadership broadening |

**Interpretation:** Not a bearish divergence (top forming) — this is rotation (leadership change). Breadth is improving as concentration decreases.
