**Multifamily housing** — Residential real estate with 5+ units. Largest commercial RE sector by transaction volume. Defensive cash flows (people always need housing), but cyclical around supply waves.

---

## Why multifamily matters

| Characteristic | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| Essential demand | Recession-resistant vs office/retail |
| Homeownership gap | Rent-vs-buy spread persistent |
| Supply constraints | Zoning, NIMBYism limit new construction |
| Institutional scale | Amenable to REIT structure |

The homeownership affordability gap remains elevated — mortgage rates + home prices keep renters renting longer.

## 2025 market conditions

**Performance (YTD Aug 2025):**

| REIT | 1-Year Return |
|------|---------------|
| Mid-America (MAA) | +1.2% |
| UDR | +0.6% |
| Aimco | -0.4% |
| **Sector average** | **-5.4%** |

Multifamily REITs rank #2 among all property sectors — but still negative returns due to supply overhang.

---

## Regional divergence

| Region | 2025 Outlook | Driver |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Coastal** (NYC, SF, Boston) | Stable/positive | Supply-constrained |
| **Sun Belt** (Austin, Phoenix, Nashville) | Transitional | 2024 delivery peak still absorbing |

**Supply cliff coming:** Deliveries falling 30-40% YoY in each of 2025-2026, further 20% in 2027. Creates opportunity for 2027-2028 developments.

## Major public REITs

| REIT | Ticker | Units | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **AvalonBay** | AVB | 90K+ | Coastal (CA, NY, NJ) |
| **Equity Residential** | EQR | 80K+ | Coastal |
| **Mid-America** | MAA | 104K+ | Sun Belt |
| **Camden Property** | CPT | 60K+ | Sun Belt |
| **UDR** | UDR | 60K+ | National |
| **Essex Property** | ESS | 62K+ | West Coast |

## Private owners

| Owner | Units | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | 230K+ | Largest PE apartment owner |
| [[Lightstone Group]] | 25K+ | Diversified private RE |
| Greystar | 800K+ | Manager/developer |

## Single-family rental (adjacent)

Different sub-sector but related dynamics:

| Player | Homes | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Invitation Homes | 85K+ | [[Blackstone]] spin-off (2017) |
| American Homes 4 Rent | 60K+ | Public REIT |
| Progress Residential | 80K+ | [[Pretium]] portfolio |

**Political risk:** Trump announced plans to ban institutional single-family homebuying (Jan 2026). See [[Institutional homebuying ban]].

## Key metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **NOI** | Net operating income (revenue - operating expenses) |
| **FFO** | Funds from operations (REIT earnings proxy) |
| **Same-store growth** | Revenue growth on stabilized properties |
| **Blended lease rate** | Weighted avg of new + renewal lease growth |

Renewal lease growth (3%+) remains strong — residents prioritizing staying in upgraded units.

---

## Cycle dynamics

**Typical pattern:**
1. Strong demand → rising rents → development starts
2. 18-24 month construction lag
3. Deliveries peak → supply exceeds absorption
4. Rent growth slows/declines → development pauses
5. Absorption catches up → cycle repeats

Current phase: Supply peak (2024) → absorption (2025-2026) → trough deliveries (2027-2028).

See [[Real estate cycles]] for broader 18-year framework.

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Homeownership unaffordable → captive renter demand
- Supply cliff creates 2027-2028 development opportunity
- Renewal lease growth shows pricing power
- Defensive vs office/retail disruption

**Bear:**
- 2025 returns negative (-5.4% sector)
- Sun Belt oversupply still absorbing
- Rent control risk in some markets (CA, NY)
- Smaller REITs exploring sales (private > public valuations)
