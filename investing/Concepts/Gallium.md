**Gallium** — Critical semiconductor material. Used in chips, LEDs, [[5G]], radar. [[China]] controls 99% of refined production. Banned for US export Dec 2024, suspended Nov 2025.

## Not a rare earth

Often grouped with rare earths but fundamentally different:

| Aspect | Gallium | Rare earths |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Use | [[Semiconductors]], LEDs | Magnets |
| Form | Compound semiconductors | Permanent magnets |
| Applications | Chips, [[5G]], radar | EVs, wind, defense |
| [[China]] control | 99% refined | 60-99% by element |

Gallium is about **chips**. Rare earths are about **magnets**.

## Why gallium matters

### Compound semiconductors

Gallium compounds enable performance silicon can't match:

| Compound | Properties | Applications |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **GaAs** (Gallium Arsenide) | High frequency, low noise | [[5G]], radar, satellites |
| **GaN** (Gallium Nitride) | High power, efficiency | Power electronics, RF |
| **GaP** (Gallium Phosphide) | Light emission | LEDs |

### Key applications

| Sector | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **[[5G]]/telecom** | RF amplifiers, base stations |
| **[[Defense]]** | Radar, electronic warfare, missiles |
| **Data centers** | Power electronics (GaN) |
| **LEDs** | Lighting, displays |
| **Solar** | Thin-film cells (CIGS) |

## [[China]]'s dominance

| Stage | [[China]] share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | Byproduct of aluminum/zinc |
| Refining | **99%** |
| US import reliance | **95%** |

**Why so concentrated**: Gallium is a byproduct of aluminum smelting. [[China]] dominates aluminum production. No dedicated gallium mines exist — it's extracted from bauxite processing waste.

---

## Export control timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jul 2023 | Export licenses required |
| Dec 3, 2024 | Full ban on US exports |
| Nov 2025 | Ban suspended until Nov 2026 |

**Trigger**: Dec 2024 ban came one day after US added 140 Chinese entities to Entity List.

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]], [[Export controls]].

## Economic impact

US Geological Survey estimates:
- **$3.4B** economic hit from Ga + Ge ban combined
- ~50% from semiconductor sector
- [[Defense]] applications particularly exposed

---

## Supply chain alternatives

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[Japan]] | Small refining capacity |
| South Korea | Developing |
| [[Germany]] | Pilot scale |
| **US (ATALCO)** | **First large-scale (Jan 2026)** |

**Challenge**: Without domestic aluminum industry, US has no gallium feedstock. Would need to build from scratch.

---

## ATALCO deal (Jan 2026)

**Pentagon takes equity stake in first US large-scale gallium producer:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pentagon equity | **$150M** (preferred) |
| Pinnacle investment | $300M |
| Additional govt funding | Expected within 30 days |
| [[Target]] gallium output | **50 metric tons/year** |
| [[Target]] alumina output | 1M+ metric tons/year |
| Location | Gramercy, Louisiana |

**ATALCO (Atlantic Alumina Co.):**
- Owned by Pinnacle-owned Concord Resources Holdings
- Operating since late 1950s (bauxite → alumina)
- Will add "country's first and only large-scale gallium production circuit"
- Claims could meet "total gallium demand in the US"

**Pinnacle Asset Management:**
- $6B+ AUM
- Jason Kellman (CIO): "Investment philosophy has centered on bolstering the US supply chain for critical minerals"

**Part of Trump pattern:** Direct government equity stakes in strategic companies ([[Intel]], US Steel golden share, Kazakhstan tungsten)

---

## Who's exposed

**Semiconductor companies:**
- RF chip makers (Qorvo, Skyworks)
- GaN power semiconductor makers
- LED manufacturers

**[[Defense]]:**
- Radar systems ([[Raytheon]], Northrop)
- Electronic warfare
- Satellite communications

---

## Investment implications

**At risk:**
- US compound semiconductor makers
- [[Defense]] contractors (radar, EW)
- [[5G]] infrastructure suppliers

**Potential beneficiaries:**
- Non-[[China]] gallium refiners (rare)
- Silicon alternatives where possible
- Recycling technology
