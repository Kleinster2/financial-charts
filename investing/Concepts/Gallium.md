**Gallium** — Critical semiconductor material. Used in chips, LEDs, 5G, radar. China controls 99% of refined production. Banned for US export Dec 2024, suspended Nov 2025.

## Not a rare earth

Often grouped with rare earths but fundamentally different:

| Aspect | Gallium | Rare earths |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Use | Semiconductors, LEDs | Magnets |
| Form | Compound semiconductors | Permanent magnets |
| Applications | Chips, 5G, radar | EVs, wind, defense |
| China control | 99% refined | 60-99% by element |

Gallium is about **chips**. Rare earths are about **magnets**.

## Why gallium matters

### Compound semiconductors

Gallium compounds enable performance silicon can't match:

| Compound | Properties | Applications |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **GaAs** (Gallium Arsenide) | High frequency, low noise | 5G, radar, satellites |
| **GaN** (Gallium Nitride) | High power, efficiency | Power electronics, RF |
| **GaP** (Gallium Phosphide) | Light emission | LEDs |

### Key applications

| Sector | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **5G/telecom** | RF amplifiers, base stations |
| **Defense** | Radar, electronic warfare, missiles |
| **Data centers** | Power electronics (GaN) |
| **LEDs** | Lighting, displays |
| **Solar** | Thin-film cells (CIGS) |

## China's dominance

| Stage | China share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | Byproduct of aluminum/zinc |
| Refining | **99%** |
| US import reliance | **95%** |

**Why so concentrated**: Gallium is a byproduct of aluminum smelting. China dominates aluminum production. No dedicated gallium mines exist — it's extracted from bauxite processing waste.

## Export control timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jul 2023 | Export licenses required |
| Dec 3, 2024 | Full ban on US exports |
| Nov 2025 | Ban suspended until Nov 2026 |

**Trigger**: Dec 2024 ban came one day after US added 140 Chinese entities to Entity List.

## Economic impact

US Geological Survey estimates:
- **$3.4B** economic hit from Ga + Ge ban combined
- ~50% from semiconductor sector
- Defense applications particularly exposed

---

## Supply chain alternatives

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Japan | Small refining capacity |
| South Korea | Developing |
| Germany | Pilot scale |
| US | Minimal (no aluminum smelting) |

**Challenge**: Without domestic aluminum industry, US has no gallium feedstock. Would need to build from scratch.

---

## Who's exposed

**Semiconductor companies:**
- RF chip makers (Qorvo, Skyworks)
- GaN power semiconductor makers
- LED manufacturers

**Defense:**
- Radar systems (Raytheon, Northrop)
- Electronic warfare
- Satellite communications

---

## Investment implications

**At risk:**
- US compound semiconductor makers
- Defense contractors (radar, EW)
- 5G infrastructure suppliers

**Potential beneficiaries:**
- Non-China gallium refiners (rare)
- Silicon alternatives where possible
- Recycling technology
