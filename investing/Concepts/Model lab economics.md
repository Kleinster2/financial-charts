# Model lab economics

The unit economics of frontier AI labs — more nuanced than "all bearish."

---

## The numbers (Dec 2025)

| Lab | Revenue | Burn rate | Break-even target |
|-----|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| [[OpenAI]] | $13B | 57% of revenue | 2030 |
| [[Anthropic]] | $9B | 9% by 2027 | 2028 |

OpenAI burning **14x more cash** than Anthropic before reaching profitability.

**Key insight**: Not all labs are equal. Anthropic's path looks plausible; OpenAI's is aggressive.

---

## Why labs burn cash

1. **Compute costs** — Training runs cost $100M+, inference at scale expensive
2. **Talent wars** — Top researchers command $1M+ packages
3. **Infrastructure** — Building proprietary data centers
4. **R&D arms race** — Must keep shipping new models to stay relevant

---

## The Anthropic exception

Anthropic is more capital-efficient:
- **80% enterprise revenue** (sticky, higher margin than consumer)
- **Avoiding costly modalities** (no image/video generation)
- **Burn rate**: 57% (OpenAI) vs 9% by 2027 (Anthropic)
- **Product success**: Claude Code, Opus 4.5 have proven enterprise value
- **Coding use case**: 55% of enterprise AI spend, clear ROI

**This matters**: If coding tools work and Anthropic captures that market, the path to profitability is real.

## The OpenAI concern

OpenAI's economics are more aggressive:
- Consumer-heavy (ChatGPT subscriptions = high churn, acquisition cost)
- Expanding into costly modalities (Sora, image generation)
- $74B cumulative losses through 2028
- Microsoft dependency (49% profit share, capped)

---

## Trade implication (refined)

**Bearish (category level):**
- Generic "AI revenue" stories without margin disclosure
- Consumer-focused model labs
- Labs competing primarily on price (see [[Open source commoditization]])

**More nuanced:**
- [[Anthropic]] — capital-efficient, enterprise-focused, coding wins. Plausible path.
- [[OpenAI]] — aggressive burn, consumer-heavy. Higher risk.

**Still bullish:**
- Infrastructure (chips, memory, power) — wins regardless of which lab succeeds
- Hyperscalers — own distribution, can subsidize AI

---

## The real question

It's not "can labs build good products?" — they clearly can (Opus 4.5, Claude Code, GPT-4).

It's:
1. **Can they capture margin?** Or does open source commoditize?
2. **Do they own distribution?** Or are they dependent on hyperscalers?
3. **Can revenue outgrow burn?** Anthropic's path looks plausible; OpenAI's is uncertain.

---

## Open source pressure

The bear case: [[Open source commoditization]] erodes pricing power.

The counter: Coding tools require trust, integration, support — not just raw model quality. Enterprise pays for reliability, not benchmarks.
