**Digital infrastructure** — The physical layer of the digital economy: data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, small cells, and edge computing. A $430B market (2026) growing to $1T+ by 2035. The AI boom transformed this from steady utility-like returns to the hottest infrastructure asset class — hyperscalers plan $400B+ capex in 2026 alone.

## The five verticals

| Vertical | What it is | Key players |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Data centers** | Buildings housing servers, storage, networking | [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]], Vantage, [[Switch]], [[QTS]] |
| **Cell towers** | Macro towers for wireless coverage | [[American Tower]], Crown Castle, SBA Communications |
| **Fiber networks** | Long-haul and metro connectivity | Zayo, Lumen, [[Corning]] (materials) |
| **Small cells** | Urban densification for 5G | Crown Castle, ExteNet |
| **Edge infrastructure** | Distributed compute near end users | DataBank, AtlasEdge, [[Cloudflare]] |

## Market size and growth

| Segment | 2025 | 2030 | CAGR |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Data centers | $430B | $1.1T | 11% |
| DC support infrastructure | $70B | $109B | 12% |
| Overall digital infra | $360B | $1.06T | 24% |
| Edge computing | $232B | $300B+ | ~8% |

**AI is the accelerant.** McKinsey estimates AI-related DC infrastructure needs $5.2T by 2030.

## The AI supercycle

### Hyperscaler capex explosion

| Company | 2025 capex | 2026 capex (est) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| [[Microsoft]] | $80B | $90B+ |
| [[Google]] | $75B | $80B+ |
| [[Amazon]] | $100B | $100B+ |
| [[Meta]] | $65B | $115-135B |
| **Total Big 4** | **$320B** | **$400B+** |

### Capacity buildout

- **100GW** of new DC capacity expected 2026-2030 (doubles global capacity)
- **$1.2T** in real estate asset value creation
- Occupancy climbing from 85% (2023) to 95%+ by late 2026
- **Power, not capital**, is now the binding constraint

## Workload shift: training → inference

| Year | Training share | Inference share |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | 50% | 50% |
| 2026 | 33% | **67%** |
| 2030 | 25% | **75%** |

**Inference = distributed demand.** Training concentrates in mega-campuses; inference spreads to edge, towers, and regional DCs. Towers and fiber benefit as inference traffic flows to devices.

---

## Power: the new constraint

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Grid limitations | Can't build DCs faster than utilities add generation |
| AI rack density | 40-100kW/rack (vs traditional 5-10kW) |
| Liquid cooling | Mandatory for AI — air cooling insufficient |
| Nuclear renaissance | [[Constellation]], [[Vistra]], [[Talen Energy]] deals with hyperscalers |
| Behind-the-meter | On-site generation ([[Crusoe Energy]], [[Bloom Energy]]) |

**By 2030:** AI DCs will consume as much electricity as Canada.

- [[Blackstone]] — owns [[QTS]], diversified
- [[Brookfield]] — infrastructure arm
- [[KKR]] — growing DC portfolio
- [[Global Infrastructure Partners]] — towers, fiber

### Operators (growth equity / private)
- Vantage Data Centers (DigitalBridge portfolio)
- [[Switch]] (DigitalBridge, SoftBank in talks ~$50B)
- DataBank (DigitalBridge)
- Yondr Group (DigitalBridge)
- [[CoreWeave]] (AI-native DC/cloud)

## K-shaped divergence

**Hot:** AI data centers, hyperscale, power-adjacent

**Stagnating:** Legacy telecom, wireless access, enterprise DC

| Segment | Trend | Driver |
|---------|-------|--------|
| AI/hyperscale DC | Explosive growth | Training + inference demand |
| Towers (macro) | Steady | 5G densification, inference backhaul |
| Fiber (long-haul) | Growing | Submarine cables, DC interconnect |
| Enterprise DC | Flat/declining | Cloud migration, consolidation |
| Wireless access | Challenged | Capex cuts, 5G ROI questions |

## Key deals (2024-2026)

| Deal | Value | Parties |
|------|-------|---------|
| [[SoftBank]] → [[DigitalBridge]] | $4B | Acquires pure-play DI manager |
| [[SoftBank]] → [[Switch]] (talks) | ~$50B | Potential, would be largest DC deal ever |
| [[Blackstone]] → Aligned Data Centers | $40B | AIP consortium (GIP, MGX, Microsoft) |
| [[Project Stargate]] | $500B | OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, MGX — multi-state AI DC buildout |
| [[Meta]] → [[Vistra]] | 2.6GW | 20-year nuclear PPAs |

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- AI demand structural, multi-decade
- Power constraints = moats for existing capacity
- Hyperscaler capex commitments locked in
- Inference spreads demand across verticals

**Bear case:**
- Supply catching up in 2027+
- DeepSeek-style efficiency gains reduce compute needs
- Interest rate sensitivity (capital-intensive)
- Power/permitting delays slow buildout
