**Big MAC trade** — "Big Midterms Are Coming." Trump's affordability focus creates sector-specific policy risk through Nov 2026 elections. Financials most at risk.

---

## The thesis

**Ed Clissold (Ned Davis Research):**
> "President Trump's focus on affordability heading into midterm elections has led to a series of actions targeting oil prices, mortgage rates, credit card rates, and the fed funds rate."

**Core idea:** Trump optimizing for Republican midterm fortunes, not market stability. Policy-by-tweet creates unpredictable sector rotation risk.

## Affordability targets (Jan 2026)

| Target | Action | Sector hit |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Credit card rates** | 10% cap demand | Banks (-5%+) |
| **Mortgage rates** | $200B GSE MBS purchase | Mixed |
| **Fed funds rate** | Powell subpoenas, pressure | Uncertainty |
| **Oil prices** | Production pressure | Energy |
| **Defense** | Dividend halt demand | Defense contractors |

---

## Why financials most at risk

**Clissold:** Clearest risks to financial sector with actions targeting:
- Credit cards ([[Credit card rate cap]])
- Mortgages ([[Fannie Mae]], [[Freddie Mac]])
- Overall interest rates ([[Fed independence]])

Banks already hit: JPM, BAC, C, WFC all tumbled post-earnings despite beats.

## Midterm historical pattern

**CFRA Research:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average midterm intra-year drawdown | **-18%** |
| Avg return (unified gov't facing loss) | **+3.8%** |
| Loss probability | ~50% |

Midterm years = lower-than-average returns due to policy uncertainty.

---

## Policy chaos risk

**Tom Essaye (Sevens Report):**
> "This is a risk we need to monitor going forward because the lack of market reaction to this policy uncertainty seems to be emboldening the administration."

> "At some point, uncertainty will take a toll and while we're not there yet, we are getting closer."

---

## Trading implications

**Michael O'Rourke (Jonestrading):**
> "You don't want to come in on a daily basis and find out a stock or a sector that you're in is the one being targeted today and your shares open down five or 10%."

42 weeks until midterms = plenty of time for more sector-specific shocks.

**Risk:** Market priced for perfection. If more industries come "under siege," high valuations won't support staying invested.

---

## Single-stock vs index volatility

| Metric | Level |
|--------|-------|
| Single-stock realized vol | ~22 points above index vol |
| VVIX (vol of VIX) | Highest since November |
| S&P 500 macro impact | Still low by historical standards |

**Dennis Debusschere (22V Research):**
> "Most of the impact from headlines is being felt at the company or sector level."

---

## How to navigate

**Kimberly Forrest (Bokeh Capital):**
- Extend time horizon (3-5 years)
- Look past current political cycle
- Own quality despite short-term noise (e.g., Exxon despite Venezuela)

For short-term traders: "Good luck."

## Predecessor: TACO trade

**TACO** = Trump's tendency to threaten tariffs then "chicken out."

Big MAC succeeds TACO as dominant political risk framework for 2026.

---

## Sectors most exposed

| Sector | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Financials** | Credit cards, mortgages, rates |
| **Defense** | Dividend/buyback restrictions |
| **Energy** | Production/price pressure |
| **Healthcare** | Drug pricing (potential) |
| **Tech** | Antitrust (ongoing) |
