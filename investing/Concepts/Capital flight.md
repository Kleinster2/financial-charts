# Capital flight

The rapid movement of financial assets out of a country in response to adverse policy changes (typically tax increases, political instability, or capital controls). A key constraint on [[Wealth tax]] policy — the more mobile capital is, the harder it is to tax.

## Mechanism

Capital flight from wealth taxation follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Tax increase announced** → wealthy residents evaluate after-tax returns vs. relocation costs
2. **Threshold crossed** → when annual tax savings exceed the personal/business cost of moving, emigration accelerates
3. **Network effects** → early movers establish communities in destination countries (Swiss cantons, Dubai, Singapore), reducing friction for followers
4. **Revenue collapse** → the departed population's tax contribution disappears, often exceeding the revenue gained from higher rates on those who stay

The critical insight: wealth taxes affect the **stock** of mobile capital, not just income flows. A 1% wealth tax on a $1B fortune is $10M/year — enough to justify significant relocation costs.

## Key examples

| Country | Year | Trigger | Result |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| [[Norway]] | 2022 | Wealth tax 0.85% → 1.1% | $54B left, 500+ wealthy emigrants, -$448M net |
| [[Sweden]] | 1970s–2007 | Sustained high wealth tax | IKEA, Tetra Pak families left; tax abolished 2007 |
| [[France]] | 2012 | 75% supertax (Hollande) | ~10,000 millionaires left 2012–2016; ISF reformed 2017 |
| Venezuela | 2000s–2010s | Capital controls, nationalizations | Massive capital and human capital flight to Miami, Madrid |
| Argentina | Recurring | Wealth taxes, currency controls | Chronic capital flight to Uruguay, Miami |

## Destination countries

The primary beneficiaries of European capital flight:
- **Switzerland** — canton-level tax competition, lump-sum taxation for foreigners, proximity to Europe
- **UAE (Dubai)** — zero income/wealth tax, golden visa programs
- **Singapore** — low tax, rule of law, Asia access
- **London** — non-dom regime (being reformed), financial infrastructure
- **Monaco** — zero income tax, Mediterranean lifestyle

## Countermeasures

Governments have developed tools to limit capital flight:
- **Exit taxes** — tax unrealised gains upon emigration ([[Norway]]: 37.8%, [[France]]: 30%)
- **CRS/AEOI** — automatic exchange of financial account information between countries (reduces hiding, but doesn't prevent legal emigration)
- **Citizenship-based taxation** — only the US and Eritrea tax citizens regardless of residence
- **Narrowing the base** — France's shift from ISF (all wealth) to IFI (real estate only) kept immovable assets taxed while releasing mobile capital
