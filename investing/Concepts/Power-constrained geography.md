**Power-Constrained Geography** — Ashburn hitting limits, pushing data centers to alternative hubs.

---

## The thesis

Power constraints are reshaping data center geography:

| Hub | Status | Driver |
|-----|--------|--------|
| [[Ashburn]] | Constrained | Dominion Energy limits |
| [[Columbus Ohio]] | Growing | Cheap AEP power |
| [[Phoenix Data Hub]] | Growing | Solar abundant |
| [[Dallas Data Hub]] | Growing | ERCOT, no state tax |
| [[Querétaro]] | Emerging | Nearshoring + power |

---

## Why Ashburn is constrained

**Dominion Energy bottleneck:**
- 3+ GW already serving DCs
- Interconnection queue: years
- Transmission upgrades slow
- Grid at capacity

70% of global internet traffic can't grow forever in one place.

---

## Where growth is going

| Hub | Power advantage | Trade-off |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| Columbus | Cheap (AEP) | Less connectivity |
| Phoenix | Solar + TSMC | Water scarcity |
| Dallas | ERCOT flexibility | Grid reliability (2021) |
| Querétaro | Available + nearshoring | Infrastructure gaps |
| [[Fortaleza Data Hub]] | Cables + renewable | Emerging |

---

## Investment implications

**Long alternative hub infrastructure:**
- AEP (Columbus power)
- Pinnacle West (Phoenix)
- Vistra (Texas)
- Mexican industrial REITs

**Long diversified DC operators:**
- [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]] — multi-hub
- [[CloudHQ]] — Querétaro bet

**Neutral Ashburn-concentrated:**
- Growth limited by power

---

## The AI accelerant

**GPU clusters = power hungry:**
- H100: 700W per chip
- Blackwell: even more
- AI training clusters: megawatts
- Ashburn can't handle the growth

AI forces geographic diversification.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ashburn power | 3+ GW (maxed) |
| Columbus growth | Rapid |
| Phoenix driver | Solar + TSMC |
| Querétaro investment | $10B+ |
