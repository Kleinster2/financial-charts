**Permanent capital** — Investment capital with no fixed redemption date or return-of-capital obligation. The "holy grail" of alternative asset management. Eliminates fundraising cycles, forced exits, and J-curve drag. Insurance liabilities are the largest source; [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s float was the original model.

## Why this matters

Permanent capital is the structural advantage that separates modern PE platforms (Apollo, KKR, Blackstone) from traditional fund managers. It explains:
- Why PE firms trade at higher multiples than asset managers
- Why every major PE firm acquired an insurer (see [[PE-insurance convergence]])
- Why Berkshire Hathaway's model is being replicated at scale

## Traditional PE fund vs. permanent capital

| Dimension | Traditional Fund | Permanent Capital |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Duration | 10 years (+ extensions) | Indefinite |
| Fundraising | Every 3-5 years | Never (or continuous) |
| Forced exits | Yes (fund maturity) | No |
| J-curve | 2-3 years negative | Eliminated |
| Cost of capital | 15-20% hurdle | 3-4% (insurance) to 0% (float) |
| Fee structure | 2/20 | ~1.4% on originated (lower carry) |
| GP time on fundraising | 30-50% | Minimal |
| Investor redemptions | At fund end | None (insurance) or periodic (evergreen) |

## Sources of permanent capital

### 1. Insurance float (largest, fastest-growing)
Annuity premiums and pension buyout payments become investable capital for decades. No redemption pressure unless mass lapse.

| Platform | Source | Approximate float |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| [[Athene]] | Fixed annuities, PRT | ~$430B |
| [[Global Atlantic]] | Annuities, reinsurance | >$200B |
| [[American Equity]] | Fixed indexed annuities | ~$130B |
| [[Fortitude Re]] | In-force reinsurance | ~$106B |
| [[F&G Annuities]] | FIA, sidecar | ~$71B |

### 2. Business Development Companies (BDCs)
Publicly listed, permanent capital vehicles that lend to middle-market companies. No fund maturity.

### 3. Publicly listed vehicles
REITs, infrastructure funds, CLO equity — traded but permanent.

### 4. Evergreen/open-end funds
Perpetual private funds with periodic liquidity windows. Growing rapidly (SEC exemptive relief in 2025 for broader retail access).

### 5. Berkshire model (original)
Insurance float from GEICO + reinsurance → invested in equities and wholly-owned businesses. Buffett's innovation; PE firms are scaling it.

## Why it matters for returns

**Compounding without interruption:**
Traditional PE forces exits at 5-7 years regardless of investment quality. Permanent capital lets winners compound indefinitely — the "Amazon holding period" applied to private assets.

**Countercyclical deployment:**
No fundraising during downturns = ability to buy when others are forced sellers. Traditional PE funds raised in good times often deploy into expensive markets.

**Operating leverage:**
Fixed management costs spread over permanent, growing AUM base. No fundraising team. No placement agents. Recurring fee income.

## The cost of permanence

**For LPs/investors:**
- Less liquidity (no fund maturity exit)
- Lower carried interest (quid pro quo for permanence)
- Valuation uncertainty (no market-clearing exit events)
- GP entrenchment risk (no fundraising discipline)

**For GPs:**
- Carry timing problem: when to crystallize performance fees without exit events?
- Solved via insurance spread income, fee-related earnings, or periodic lookback mechanisms

## 2025 growth trends

- Evergreen PCVs becoming mainstream: once resisted by LPs, now actively sought
- SEC exemptive relief (Mar 2025): private BDCs can offer multiple share classes to retail
- PE firms targeting retail/HNW ($80T capital pool) via permanent structures
- Insurance remains dominant source: $928B US life/health ceded to Bermuda
