# Grid Storage

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) for utility-scale applications. Distinct market from EV batteries — different buyers, use cases, and economics.

## Why grid storage matters

| Driver | Dynamic |
|--------|---------|
| **Renewable intermittency** | Solar duck curve, wind variability |
| **Grid stability** | Frequency regulation, voltage support |
| **Peak shaving** | Avoid expensive peaker plants |
| **Resilience** | Backup during outages |
| **Transmission deferral** | Storage cheaper than new lines |

## Market segments

| Segment | Duration | Use case | Players |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Short-duration** | 2-4 hours | Peak shaving, ancillary services | [[Tesla Energy]], [[Fluence]], [[BYD]] |
| **Long-duration** | 8-100+ hours | Multi-day renewable storage | [[Form Energy]], ESS Inc |
| **Behind-the-meter** | 2-4 hours | Commercial/industrial | Tesla Powerwall, Enphase |

## Key players

| Company | Product | Technology | Scale |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| **[[Tesla Energy]]** | Megapack | LFP li-ion | 40+ GWh deployed |
| **[[Fluence]]** | Gridstack | Li-ion | Major utility contracts |
| **[[BYD]]** | Cube | LFP (Blade) | Large installations |
| **[[Form Energy]]** | Iron-air | Iron-air (100hr) | First deployments 2024 |
| **ESS Inc** | Energy Warehouse | Iron flow | Long-duration |

## Technology comparison

| Chemistry | Duration | Cost | Maturity |
|-----------|----------|------|----------|
| **Lithium-ion (LFP)** | 2-4 hours | Lowest | Dominant |
| **Iron-air** | 100+ hours | Very low $/kWh | Emerging |
| **Flow batteries** | 4-12 hours | Medium | Niche |
| **Compressed air** | 8-24 hours | Site-dependent | Limited |
| **Pumped hydro** | 8-24 hours | Lowest (at scale) | Geography-constrained |

---

## Market size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global BESS market (2024) | ~$15B |
| Projected (2030) | ~$50B |
| US installations (2024) | ~15 GW |
| Growth driver | IRA incentives, renewable mandates |

## Investment dynamics

**Bull case:**
- Renewable buildout requires storage
- IRA standalone storage credit (30-50%)
- Utility procurement accelerating
- Cost curve still declining

**Bear case:**
- Lithium price volatility
- Interconnection queues (3-5 year waits)
- Utility procurement cycles slow
- Competition intensifying (margins)
