**US-[[China]] security** — Military competition and flashpoints. Taiwan is the primary risk; South [[China]] Sea is ongoing friction.

---

## Flashpoints

### Taiwan (highest risk)

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Strategic value** | [[TSMC]] = 90% advanced chips |
| **US commitment** | Ambiguous (Taiwan Relations Act) |
| **[[China]] timeline** | Xi wants "reunification" — 2027-2035 window |
| **Deterrence** | US arms sales, carrier groups |

**Why it matters:** Taiwan controls global semiconductor supply. A blockade or invasion would be the largest economic shock since WWII.

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Status quo | Baseline | Tension but manageable |
| Blockade | Low-medium | Global chip crisis |
| Invasion | Low | WWIII risk, catastrophic |
| Negotiated settlement | Very low | Requires regime change |

### South [[China]] Sea

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **[[China]] claim** | Nine-dash line (rejected by UNCLOS) |
| **Militarization** | Artificial islands with runways, missiles |
| **US response** | Freedom of navigation ops (FONOPs) |
| **Friction** | Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia |

**[[Trade]] exposure:** ~$3.4T in annual trade transits SCS.

### Other flashpoints

| Flashpoint | Risk level | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| **Korea** | Medium | [[China]] backs North Korea |
| **[[India]] border** | Low-medium | Himalayan standoffs |
| **Pacific islands** | Low | Influence competition |

## Military balance

### Naval

| Metric | US | [[China]] |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Carriers | 11 | 3 (building more) |
| Submarines | 68 | 60+ |
| Total ships | ~290 | ~370 (world's largest) |
| Shipbuilding | Limited capacity | Massive capacity |

**Trend:** [[China]] building faster. US advantage is experience, allies, global reach.

### Missiles

| Capability | US | [[China]] |
|------------|-----|-------|
| ICBMs | ~400 | ~500+ (growing fast) |
| Hypersonics | Behind | DF-17, DF-27 operational |
| Anti-ship | Tomahawk, LRASM | DF-21D "carrier killer" |

### Cyber/space

| Domain | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Cyber | Both capable; [[China]] targets IP theft |
| [[Space]] | US ahead but [[China]] closing (ASAT, Beidou) |
| AI/autonomy | Critical for future warfare |

---

## Defense spending

| Country | 2025 budget | % GDP |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| US | ~$886B | ~3.5% |
| [[China]] | ~$230B (official) | ~1.5% |

**Note:** [[China]]'s real spending likely 2-3x official figure. PPP-adjusted gap is smaller.

---

## US alliances

| Alliance | Members | Relevance |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **AUKUS** | US, [[UK]], [[Australia]] | Nuclear subs, tech sharing |
| **Quad** | US, [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Australia]] | Indo-Pacific coordination |
| **Five Eyes** | US, [[UK]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], NZ | Intelligence |
| **US-Japan** | Bilateral | Most capable ally (see [[China-Japan relations]]) |
| **US-Philippines** | Bilateral | SCS frontline |

**[[China]] weakness:** No formal alliances ([[Russia]] is "no limits" partnership, not treaty).

## Investment implications

### Taiwan crisis hedges

| Play | Ticker | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Defense primes | [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[RTX]] | War production |
| Shipbuilders | HII, GD | Naval expansion |
| Missiles | [[RTX]], LMT | Precision munitions |
| Cyber/space | [[Palantir]], LMT, NOC | Modernization |

### Semiconductor reshoring

| Play | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| [[Intel]] | US fabs, [[CHIPS Act]] beneficiary |
| [[GlobalFoundries]] | US/[[EU]] capacity |
| [[ASML]] | Equipment regardless of location |

### Exposed companies

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Apple]] | [[China]] manufacturing, 20% revenue |
| [[NVIDIA]] | [[China]] sales restrictions |
| [[Tesla]] | Shanghai Gigafactory |
| [[Starbucks]] | [[China]] growth story |

---

## Key actors

| Role | US | [[China]] |
|------|-----|-------|
| Military | Pentagon, INDOPACOM | PLA (Xi is CMC chair) |
| Policy | NSC, State | CMC, Politburo |
| Defense industry | LMT, NOC, RTX, BA | AVIC, CSIC, [[Norinco]] |

---

## Signposts to watch

| [[Signal]] | Bullish (de-escalation) | Bearish (escalation) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Taiwan | No new red lines | Increased PLA exercises |
| SCS | Reduced FONOPs | Collision/incident |
| Arms sales | Stable | Major Taiwan package |
| Rhetoric | Diplomatic contact | "Reunification" timelines |
| Military | No mobilization | Reserve activations |
