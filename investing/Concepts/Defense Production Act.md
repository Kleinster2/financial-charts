**Defense Production Act (DPA)** — Korean War-era statute (1950, extended through September 2026) giving the president broad authority to direct private industry for national defense. Used for steel, vaccines (COVID-19), and now threatened against [[Anthropic]] for AI.

## Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Enacted | 1950 |
| Current extension | September 2026 |
| Scope | Presidential power to requisition industry for national defense |
| Recent use (COVID-19) | Ventilators, vaccines, PPE |
| Recent threat | [[Anthropic]] (Feb 2026) — AI model access |
| Key invocation | Biden EO 14110 (AI reporting and transparency) |

---

## How it works

1. **Presidential authority**: President can invoke for "national defense" (broadly defined)
2. **Priority directives**: Can order companies to prioritize government contracts
3. **Allocation powers**: Direct production allocation, materials allocation
4. **Penalties**: Criminal penalties for non-compliance
5. **Compensation**: Invoking entity typically pays market rates (not conscription)

## Recent invocations

| Event | Year | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| COVID-19 vaccine production | 2020-2021 | Prioritized vaccine manufacturing |
| COVID-19 ventilators | 2020 | Forced General Motors to retool |
| COVID-19 PPE | 2020 | Masks, gowns, gloves |
| Biden AI EO 14110 | 2023 | AI companies must report capabilities/safety testing |
| [[Anthropic]] threat | Feb 2026 | Threatened to invoke DPA to mandate AI model access |

## Strategic significance

1. **Broad definition of "defense"**: Includes infrastructure, technology, industrial capacity
2. **Low threshold for invocation**: President determines what counts as "national defense"
3. **Political tool**: Can be weaponized against private companies
4. **AI as new frontier**: [[Anthropic]] case signals extension into AI/tech policy

## Investment implications

- Tech/AI companies face regulatory risk if administration deems AI a "defense asset"
- Unpredictable invocation creates policy uncertainty for AI labs
- [[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], other labs exposed to DPA leverage
- Potential precedent: if DPA succeeds against one AI lab, others face same threat
