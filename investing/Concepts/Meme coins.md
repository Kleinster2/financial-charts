#concept #crypto #speculation

**Meme coins** — Cryptocurrency tokens with no intrinsic utility, driven purely by social momentum, virality, and speculation. The crypto equivalent of [[Meme stocks]], but with lower barriers to entry, faster cycles, and no short squeeze mechanics — just pure narrative trading.

## Why this matters

Meme coins are a leading indicator of retail risk appetite and crypto speculation cycles. When meme coins pump, it signals excess liquidity seeking returns. When they collapse, retail gets wiped out and sentiment shifts.

## The infrastructure

| Layer | Key players |
|-------|-------------|
| **Blockchain** | [[Solana]] (dominant), Base, Ethereum |
| **Launch platforms** | pump.fun (Solana), token factories |
| **Exchanges** | DEXs first, then [[Coinbase]], [[Robinhood]] if volume sufficient |
| **Tracking** | DEX Screener, Birdeye, DexTools |

**Why Solana dominates:** Low fees (~$0.001/tx) and fast finality enable high-frequency speculation. Ethereum's gas costs price out retail gamblers.

**pump.fun:** Solana-based platform that lets anyone launch a token in minutes. No code required. Handles bonding curves, liquidity, and listing. Earned >$100M in fees by late 2024.

## The new wave: AI agent coins

A 2024-2025 phenomenon — AI agents (or accounts claiming to be AI) launch tokens:

| Token | Agent | Peak | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| $GOAT | Truth Terminal | ~$1B mcap | First AI agent token; Andy Ayrey's Claude-based bot |
| $CLAWD | Clawdbot | $16M | Solana; viral AI entity; now ~$4M |
| $TURBO | GPT-4 experiment | $50M+ | "First memecoin made by AI" |

**The dynamic:** AI accounts build followings on X, sometimes receive token "gifts" from fans, prices pump on virality. Blurs line between genuine AI behavior and human manipulation.

## Celebrity and political tokens

| Token | Figure | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| $TRUMP | Donald Trump | Launched pre-inauguration Jan 2025; peaked >$10B FDV |
| $MELANIA | Melania Trump | Followed days later; smaller |
| Celebrity tokens | Various | Mostly rug pulls; Hawk Tuah ($HAWK), etc. |

**Pattern:** Celebrity announces token → insiders pre-buy → retail FOMOs → insiders dump → retail holds bags.

## Key differences from meme stocks

| Dimension | Meme stocks | Meme coins |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Barrier to create** | Requires public company | Anyone can launch in minutes |
| **Short squeeze** | Core mechanic | Doesn't exist |
| **Regulation** | SEC oversight | Minimal (offshore, pseudonymous) |
| **Cycle speed** | Weeks to months | Hours to days |
| **Institutional participation** | Some (MEME ETF) | Rare |
| **Recovery potential** | Companies can pivot | Zero intrinsic value |

## The speculation cycle

1. **Launch** — Token created on pump.fun or similar
2. **Seeding** — Insiders/devs accumulate; influencers paid to promote
3. **Viral moment** — X/TikTok/Telegram picks up narrative
4. **CEX listing** — If volume sufficient, Coinbase/Robinhood list (legitimizes)
5. **Peak** — Retail FOMO maxes out
6. **Dump** — Early holders exit; price collapses 80-99%
7. **Zombie phase** — Token trades at tiny fraction of peak indefinitely

Most coins never reach step 4. The ones that do (DOGE, SHIB, PEPE) become "blue chip memes."

## "Blue chip" meme coins

Survivors with staying power (relative term):

| Token | Origin | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Dogecoin (DOGE) | 2013 joke | [[Elon Musk]] association; $20B+ mcap |
| Shiba Inu (SHIB) | 2020 DOGE derivative | Ecosystem attempts |
| Pepe (PEPE) | 2023 | Frog meme; Ethereum-based |
| Bonk (BONK) | 2022 | Solana community coin |

These trade on brand recognition and liquidity, not fundamentals.

## Investment implications

**Not investable for serious capital** — zero fundamentals, pure greater-fool dynamics.

**Signal value:**
- Meme coin pumps = retail risk-on, excess liquidity
- Meme coin collapse = risk-off rotation
- CEX listing activity = exchange revenue/desperation indicator

**Infrastructure plays:**
- [[Solana]] benefits from meme coin fees/activity
- [[Coinbase]] earns listing fees and trading revenue
- Market makers (wintermute, etc.) provide liquidity
