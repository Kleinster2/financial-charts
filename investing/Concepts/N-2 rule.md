Taiwan's restriction preventing [[TSMC]] from producing leading-edge nodes at overseas fabs until Taiwan is **two generations ahead**.

## How it works

- If 2nm is leading edge in Taiwan, overseas fabs can only produce 5nm or older
- Arizona can't do 2nm until Taiwan has 1.4nm (or equivalent) in production
- Protects Taiwan's strategic leverage over global chip supply

## Implications

- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] is structurally constrained — not just by execution, but by policy
- Customers needing cutting-edge U.S. production may turn to [[Samsung]] or [[Intel Foundry Services]]
- Creates artificial opening for competitors despite TSMC's execution advantage

## Who benefits

- [[Samsung]] — AMD, Google reportedly exploring 2nm deals (Dec 2025)
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] — domestic alternative without N-2 constraint
- Taiwan — maintains geopolitical leverage

## Current status (Dec 2025)

- **Under active consideration** — Taiwan weighing stricter enforcement
- Japan Kumamoto Fab 2 may skip 6nm and go straight to 2nm — testing policy limits
- Response to US pressure for advanced Arizona fabs

## Open question

Will U.S. pressure force Taiwan to relax N-2? Or does Taiwan hold firm as insurance against abandonment?

## Thesis implications

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | Protects Taiwan moat, limits overseas margin dilution |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Samsung not subject to same rule — potential advantage |

- [[TSMC]] — constrained (Arizona can't do leading edge)
- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] — limited (only N-2 nodes)
- [[Samsung]] — beneficiary (no N-2 constraint)
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] — beneficiary (domestic alternative)
- [[Taiwan concentration risk]] — driver (Taiwan protects leverage)
- [[Leading edge race]] — context (creates opening for competitors)
