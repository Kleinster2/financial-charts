## Position sizing factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Conviction | Higher = larger |
| Volatility | Higher = smaller |
| Correlation | Higher = smaller |
| Liquidity | Lower = smaller |
| Portfolio size | Affects minimums |

---

## Sizing approaches

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| **Equal weight** | Same $ per position |
| **Conviction-weighted** | Best ideas largest |
| **Risk parity** | Equal risk contribution |
| **Kelly criterion** | Probability-based |
| **Fixed fractional** | % of capital risked |

---

## Typical position limits

| Position type | Range |
|---------------|-------|
| Core holding | 5-15% |
| Standard position | 2-5% |
| Speculative | 1-2% |
| Maximum single | 20-25% |

---

## Kelly criterion

| Formula | f* = (p × b - q) / b |
|---------|----------------------|
| p | Probability of win |
| q | Probability of loss (1-p) |
| b | Win/loss ratio |
| f* | Optimal fraction |

**Practical: Use half-Kelly for volatility.**

## Concentration vs diversification

| Style | Positions | Tradeoff |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Concentrated | 8-15 | High conviction, volatility |
| Moderate | 20-30 | Balanced |
| Diversified | 40-60 | Lower alpha, lower risk |
| Index-like | 100+ | Market return |

## Position sizing rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Never >20% single | Avoid catastrophic loss |
| Start small, add | Average in |
| Reduce on thesis doubt | Manage risk |
| Rebalance periodically | Control drift |
| Cut losers with broken thesis | Avoid value traps |

---

## Adding to positions

| Approach | When |
|----------|------|
| Average down | Thesis intact, price lower |
| Average up | Momentum, thesis strengthening |
| Pyramiding | Building into winners |
| Fixed dollar | Systematic |

## Risk-based sizing

| Volatility | Position size |
|------------|---------------|
| Low (σ <15%) | Standard |
| Moderate (15-25%) | Reduce 20-30% |
| High (25-40%) | Reduce 50% |
| Very high (>40%) | Minimal sizing |
