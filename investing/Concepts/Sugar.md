**Sugar** — global soft commodity. Sugarcane is dual-use: food sweetener + [[Ethanol]] feedstock. [[Brazil]] produces ~22% of global sugar and ~30% of global ethanol — mills swing production between the two based on relative pricing.

## Global production

| Producer | Share | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **[[Brazil]]** | ~22% | Centre-South region dominates; [[Raizen]] largest single producer |
| [[India]] | ~15% | Second largest; periodic export bans |
| EU | ~8% | Sugar beet (not cane) |
| Thailand | ~5% | Major exporter |
| China | ~5% | Mostly domestic consumption |

## Sugar-ethanol swing

Brazilian mills can shift sugarcane allocation between sugar and [[Ethanol]] production:

| Condition | Mill response |
|-----------|---------------|
| High sugar price, low ethanol | Maximize sugar output |
| High ethanol price, low sugar | Maximize ethanol output |
| Drought / poor harvest | Both tighten simultaneously |

This creates a price linkage between global sugar futures and Brazilian ethanol markets. [[Raizen]] operates 24 mills with this flex capability.

## Sugarcane byproducts

| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Juice** | Sugar crystals or 1G [[Ethanol]] |
| **Bagasse** | [[Biomass]] power co-generation, [[E2G]] feedstock |
| **Vinasse** | Fertilizer (potassium-rich) |
| **Filter cake** | Organic fertilizer |

The integrated biorefinery model (sugar + ethanol + power) is [[Raizen]]'s core business.
