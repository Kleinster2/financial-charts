**Crypto-to-AI Pivot** — Bitcoin miners converting to AI hosting. Better economics.

---

## The thesis

AI hosting pays more than mining:

| Metric | Bitcoin Mining | AI Hosting |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Revenue/MW | $0.5-1M/year | $1-4M/year |
| Contracts | None (spot) | Long-term PPAs |
| Capex reuse | GPUs useless | Infrastructure reusable |
| Customer | None | Hyperscalers |

---

## Why miners are pivoting

| Factor | Mining | AI |
|--------|--------|---|
| Revenue stability | Volatile (BTC price) | Contracted |
| Customer quality | None | Microsoft, CoreWeave |
| Margins | Compressing | Expanding |
| Power value | Commodity | Premium |

---

## Winners

| Company | Ticker | 2024 Return | Key Deal |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| [[IREN]] | IREN | +300% | Microsoft $9.7B |
| [[Hut 8]] | HUT | Strong | Fluidstack/Google $7B |
| [[Core Scientific]] | CORZ | Strong | CoreWeave $3.5B |
| [[Cipher Mining]] | CIFR | +230% | Pivoting |
| [[TeraWulf]] | WULF | Strong | Fluidstack 200MW |

---

## Losers

| Company | Ticker | 2024 Return | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| [[Marathon Digital]] | MARA | Underperforming | Bitcoin pure-play |
| [[Bitdeer]] | BTDR | -50% | ASIC focus |

Pure Bitcoin = underperforming.

## What miners have

**Reusable infrastructure:**
- Land
- Power contracts (cheap)
- Substations
- Cooling
- Grid connections

Everything except GPUs.

## The deals

| Miner | Partner | Deal |
|-------|---------|------|
| IREN | Microsoft | $9.7B |
| Hut 8 | Fluidstack/Google | $7B |
| Core Scientific | CoreWeave | $3.5B |
| TeraWulf | Fluidstack | 200MW |
| **TeraWulf + Hut 8 + Cipher** | **Anthropic** | **~1M TPUv7 infrastructure** |

Hyperscalers AND AI labs paying premium for powered land.

---

## Anthropic deal (Jan 2026)

**Landmark AI lab deal (per SemiAnalysis):**

| Component | Provider |
|-----------|----------|
| TPUv7 chips (~1M) | [[Broadcom]] direct to Anthropic |
| DC infrastructure | [[TeraWulf]], [[Hut 8]], [[Cipher Mining]] |
| Deployment/ops | [[FluidStack]] |

**Why this matters:**
- First major AI lab (not hyperscaler) using crypto miners
- Validates pivot thesis beyond Microsoft/Google
- Anthropic controlling own facilities, not renting cloud
- FluidStack as deployment layer (cabling, burn-in, testing)

---

## Investment implications

**Long pivoting miners:**
- IREN, Hut 8, Core Scientific
- Power infrastructure plays
- Hyperscaler validation

**Avoid pure Bitcoin:**
- Marathon, Bitdeer
- No pivot = left behind

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI hosting revenue | $1-4M/MW/year |
| Mining revenue | $0.5-1M/MW/year |
| IREN 2024 | +300% |
| Bitdeer 2024 | -50% |
