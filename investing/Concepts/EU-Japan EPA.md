## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parties | EU (27) + Japan |
| Population | 580M |
| Combined GDP | ~$21T |
| Trade covered | ~€170B/year |

## Why it worked

| Factor | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **EU-only competence** | No national parliament votes |
| **No ISDS** | Removed contentious investment chapter |
| **Low agriculture sensitivity** | Japan rice excluded, manageable |
| **Strategic timing** | Counter to Trump protectionism |
| **Like-minded partners** | Shared regulatory values |

**Key lesson:** EU-only deals ratify fast. Mixed agreements (CETA) stall.
