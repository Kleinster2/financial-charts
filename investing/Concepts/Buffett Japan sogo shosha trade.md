# Buffett Japan sogo shosha trade

[[Warren Buffett]]'s largest international bet in decades — accumulating stakes in [[Japan]]'s five major trading houses (*sogo shosha*) starting 2019, disclosed Aug 2020. By Feb 2026, [[Berkshire Hathaway]] has made **$24B** on the position.

## The five trading houses

| Company | Ticker | Business |
|---------|--------|----------|
| [[Mitsubishi Corp]] | 8058.T | Commodities, energy, food, industrials |
| [[Mitsui & Co]] | 8031.T | Energy, metals, chemicals, infrastructure |
| [[Itochu]] | 8001.T | Consumer, textiles, food, IT |
| [[Marubeni]] | 8002.T | Agriculture, energy, metals, power |
| [[Sumitomo Corp]] | 8053.T | Metals, transport, infrastructure, media |

These are massive diversified conglomerates — commodities, logistics, energy, food — essentially Japan's version of Berkshire itself. All five traded below book value when Buffett started buying.

## The structure

Buffett funded the purchases by issuing **yen-denominated bonds** — borrowing at near-zero Japanese rates to buy yen-denominated assets yielding 3-5% dividends. This created:
- **Currency hedge**: liabilities and assets both in yen (no FX risk)
- **Carry trade**: borrowing at ~0.5% to collect ~4% dividends
- **Asymmetric upside**: if Japan reflated, stocks would rise; if it didn't, dividends still covered borrowing costs

## Timeline

- **2019**: Berkshire begins accumulating ~5% stakes in all five
- **Aug 2020**: Disclosed on Buffett's 90th birthday. Markets initially shrugged
- **2023**: Buffett visits Tokyo, raises stakes to ~8.5% each, says he'd go higher. Trip catalyzed the "Japan is back" institutional narrative
- **2024**: Nikkei breaks 1989 ATH. Trading houses surge 2-3x from Buffett's cost basis
- **2026**: Position worth ~$24B in gains. Berkshire continues to hold

## Why it mattered

When the world's most famous value investor makes his biggest international bet in decades on a country everyone had written off, institutions pay attention. The Buffett endorsement:
- Legitimized Japan for a generation of allocators who hadn't looked at Tokyo since the 90s
- Coincided with [[Japan corporate governance revolution|TSE governance reforms]] that were improving exactly the metrics (ROE, buybacks, PBR) that made these stocks cheap
- Proved the "Japan is uninvestable" consensus was wrong
