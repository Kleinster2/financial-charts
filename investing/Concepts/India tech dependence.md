**India tech dependence** — India's industrial ambitions constrained by Chinese technology and low domestic R&D.

## R&D gap — 27 years of stagnation

*[[China]]*

| Metric | India | China |
|--------|-------|-------|
| R&D as % GDP (1996) | ~0.6% | ~0.6% |
| R&D as % GDP (2023) | ~0.6% | ~2.5% |
| Trend | **Flat for 27 years** | 4x growth |

India and China started at the same R&D intensity in 1996. China invested; India didn't. The gap explains why "Make in India" struggles.

## "Make in India" battery failure

| Metric | Plan | Reality |
|--------|------|---------|
| Subsidy pool | ₹181B ($2B) | — |
| Capacity target | 50 GWh | **1 GWh installed** |
| Timeline | By 2027 | 2% of target |
| Companies affected | Reliance, Adani, JSW | All pivoted to assembly |

**Why it failed:** Chinese tech licensing blocked by Beijing. Japanese/European/Korean alternatives 30-50% more expensive — uncompetitive at scale. See [[China battery leverage]].

## Battery imports

| Year | Total imports | From China |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 2018 | ~$0.4B | ~75% |
| 2025 | **$3B** | **75%** ($2.2B) |

Imports grew **2.5x** while domestic manufacturing failed to scale.

## Rare earth / magnet concerns

India announced $800M in subsidies for domestic permanent magnet production. Skeptics note:
- Significant coastal reserves exist but minimal mining
- For decades, state miner sold output to [[Japan]] (not domestic use)
- China controls 90% of rare earth processing
- Some critical minerals India doesn't have in extractable quantities

See [[Rare earth leverage]].

## Structural implications

| Sector | China dependency | Workaround |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **EV batteries** | 75% import share | Assembly only, no cell manufacturing |
| **Power equipment** | BHEL uncompetitive | Lifting 2020 curbs (Jan 2026) |
| **Semiconductors** | No advanced manufacturing | Legacy node assembly (28nm+) |
| **Telecom equipment** | Huawei/ZTE banned but alternatives expensive | Reliance Jio, Nokia, Ericsson |
| **Solar panels** | ~80% from China | Assembly, not manufacturing |

**What works:** IT services, pharma generics (though API dependence on China), infrastructure buildout.

**What doesn't work:** Capital-intensive manufacturing requiring tech transfer.
