**Token unlocks** — scheduled releases of previously locked tokens into circulation, creating sell pressure.

## Why tokens are locked

When crypto projects launch, large portions of supply are locked and vest over time:

| Recipient | Typical lock | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Team/founders | 1-4 years | Prevent dump, align long-term incentives |
| Early investors | 6-24 months | VCs can't exit immediately |
| Community/grants | Gradual | Distributed for adoption |
| Treasury | Variable | Project runway |

## Mechanics

**Cliff** — initial period with no unlocks (e.g., 12-month cliff)

**Vesting** — gradual release after cliff (e.g., linear over 36 months)

**Example schedule:**
- Launch: 15% circulating
- Month 12: Cliff ends, 10% unlocks
- Months 13-48: 2% monthly unlocks

## Price impact

Even with constant demand, more supply = lower price.

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Unlock day | Recipients often sell immediately |
| Heavy schedule | Persistent headwind regardless of fundamentals |
| Light schedule | Less dilution pressure |

**FDV vs market cap gap** shows unlock exposure:
- Market cap = circulating × price
- [[FDV]] = total supply × price
- Large gap = significant unlocks ahead

## Tracking unlocks

Sites like Token Unlocks, CoinGecko, and Messari track vesting schedules. Major unlocks often correlate with price drops.
