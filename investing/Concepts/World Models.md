**World Models** — AI paradigm focused on understanding physics and 3D environments rather than just text prediction. Emerging challenger to LLM dominance.

## Why World Models matter

The next frontier in AI — systems that understand how the physical world works:

| Approach | Focus | Key proponent |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **LLMs** | Text prediction | [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]] |
| **World Models** | Physics, causality, 3D | [[Yann LeCun]], [[Fei-Fei Li]] |

[[Yann LeCun]] predicts world models will be "the dominant model for AI architectures" within 3-5 years.

## Key players (Jan 2026)

| Company | Product | Status | Funding |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| **AMI Labs** ([[Yann LeCun]]) | VL-JEPA | In development | €500M @ €3B valuation |
| **[[World Labs]]** ([[Fei-Fei Li]]) | **Marble** | Commercial (free-$95/mo) | $230M raised, **$5B valuation** (Jan 2026) |
| **[[Google DeepMind]]** | **Genie 3** | Released | Internal |

## Three competing approaches

**1. LeCun-style (internal predictive state)**
- "World" lives inside agent as latent variables
- Transition functions predict outcomes
- Focus on reasoning about physics
- Goal: Human-like understanding

**2. Genie-style (interactive simulation)**
- Continuous, controllable video worlds
- Agents can try, fail, retry
- 720p / 24fps real-time generation
- Persistent objects across frames

**3. World Labs (spatial intelligence)**
- Large World Models (LWMs)
- Perceive, generate, interact with 3D
- Generate persistent, downloadable environments
- From text, photos, video, or 3D layouts

## Google DeepMind Genie 3

First real-time interactive world model:

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Resolution | 720p |
| Frame rate | 24 fps |
| Duration | Several minutes |
| Input | Text prompt |
| Output | Interactive 3D environment |

**Features:** Object persistence, prompt-able events ("it starts raining"), agent navigation.

## World Labs Marble

Commercial world model product:

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | Basic generation |
| Pro | $95/mo | Full features |

**Capabilities:** Generate persistent 3D environments from text, photos, videos, 3D layouts, or panoramic images.

---

## Why this matters for investing

**Use cases emerging:**
- Robotics training (simulate before deploy)
- AI training environments
- Prototyping and design
- Gaming and entertainment

**Thesis implications:**
- LLM-only approaches may hit ceiling
- Compute demand shifts (video generation is expensive)
- New hardware requirements (3D rendering + AI inference)
- Robotics enablement (train in simulation)
