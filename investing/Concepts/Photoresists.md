**Photoresists** — Light-sensitive chemicals that transfer circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Japan controls ~90% of EUV photoresists. The "other chokepoint" alongside [[ASML]] equipment.

## What photoresists do

Photolithography process:
1. **Coat** wafer with photoresist
2. **Expose** through mask using light (DUV or EUV)
3. **Develop** — exposed/unexposed areas dissolve differently
4. **Etch** — pattern transfers to underlying layer
5. **Strip** — remove remaining resist
6. **Repeat** — 50-100+ times per chip

**No photoresist = no pattern transfer = no chips.**

## Types by wavelength

| Type | Wavelength | Node | Status |
|------|------------|------|--------|
| **g-line** | 436nm | Legacy | Mature |
| **i-line** | 365nm | >250nm | Mature, automotive/IoT |
| **KrF** | 248nm | 250nm-130nm | Mature, 3D NAND |
| **ArF dry** | 193nm | 130nm-65nm | Mature |
| **ArF immersion** | 193nm | 65nm-7nm | Workhorse |
| **EUV** | 13.5nm | 7nm and below | Fastest growth |

**EUV is the frontier** — and Japan dominates it.

## Why EUV photoresists are hard

| Challenge | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Wavelength** | 13.5nm vs 193nm — completely different chemistry |
| **Absorption** | Must efficiently absorb EUV photons |
| **Sensitivity** | Lower light intensity = need higher sensitivity |
| **Outgassing** | Vacuum environment — can't release contaminants |
| **Line edge roughness** | Smaller features = tighter tolerances |
| **Stochastic defects** | Random photon absorption causes variability |

**Result:** Decades of R&D required. Can't be replicated quickly.

## Japan dominance

| Company | EUV share | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private (JIC 2024) |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | Public |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Public (diversified) |

**Top 3 Japan = ~90% of EUV photoresists.**

### Why Japan?

- **Decades of investment:** JSR, TOK founded in 1950s-60s
- **Chemistry expertise:** Deep materials science tradition
- **Customer relationships:** Co-developed with TSMC, Intel
- **Tacit knowledge:** Can't be learned from papers

## Market structure

| Segment | Size (2024) | Growth |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Total photoresist | ~$5B | 5-6% CAGR |
| EUV photoresist | ~$250M | **25%+ CAGR** |

EUV is small but fastest-growing — and most strategic.

## The chokepoint thesis

### Compared to equipment

| Chokepoint | Controller | Leverage used? |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| EUV lithography | [[ASML]] (Netherlands) | Yes — China blocked |
| EUV photoresists | Japan (JSR, TOK, Shin-Etsu) | **Not yet** |

### 2019 precedent

Japan briefly restricted photoresist exports to Korea over wartime labor dispute:
- Samsung and SK Hynix disrupted
- Korea accelerated [[Dongjin Semichem]] domestic supply
- Demonstrated Japan's latent leverage

### Strategic implications

- Japan hasn't weaponized photoresists like US weaponized equipment
- But JIC taking JSR private signals strategic awareness
- Materials could be next [[Export controls]] frontier

## China localization

### Current state (2024-2025)

| Type | China localization |
|------|-------------------|
| g-line | ~20% |
| i-line | ~20% |
| KrF | <5% |
| ArF | <5% |
| **EUV** | **~0%** |

### 2026 target

China targeting **40% photoresist self-sufficiency by 2026** (up from ~10% in 2024).

### Key Chinese players

| Company | Progress |
|---------|----------|
| **Hubei Dinglong** | ArF/KrF validated Dec 2024 |
| Wuhan Taiziwei | KrF mass production |
| Rongda | Capacity expansion |

### Challenges

- **Tacit knowledge:** Can't reverse-engineer decades of process know-how
- **Quality control:** Sub-ppb contamination requirements
- **Customer qualification:** 12-24 months to certify new supplier
- **EUV gap:** Fundamental chemistry challenges remain

**Timeline:** 5-10+ years for meaningful EUV localization, if ever.

See [[China semiconductor self-sufficiency]] for broader context.

## Investment thesis

See [[Long Japan photoresists]] for the full thesis.

**Summary:** Japan's 90% EUV share is defensible. As EUV adoption grows (25%+ CAGR), photoresist demand grows. [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] is the cleanest public pure-play.
