# PPP

**Public-Private Partnership** — Contractual arrangement where private sector finances, builds, and operates public infrastructure in exchange for user fees or government payments over a concession period (typically 20-30 years). Used globally for transport, utilities, hospitals, schools.

---

## Why PPPs matter

**Unlocks infrastructure without upfront public spending:**

- **Capital access**: Private equity/debt funds construction upfront
- **Risk transfer**: Construction, operation, demand risk shared with private sector
- **Faster delivery**: Single contractor incentivized to deliver on time
- **Lifecycle thinking**: Same party builds and maintains — aligned incentives
- **Off balance sheet**: Government debt metrics improved (controversial)

## How PPPs work

### Basic structure

```
Government ←--Concession Contract--→ SPV (Project Company)
                                        ↑
                    ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
                 Equity              Debt              Contractors
              (Sponsors)          (Banks/Bonds)        (EPC/O&M)
```

### Key parties

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Government** | Grants concession, may provide subsidies, regulates |
| **SPV** | Special Purpose Vehicle — holds concession, raises finance |
| **Equity sponsors** | Infrastructure funds, contractors, pension funds |
| **Lenders** | Banks, bondholders — project finance debt |
| **EPC contractor** | Engineering, Procurement, Construction |
| **O&M operator** | Operations & Maintenance |

### Cash flow waterfall

Revenue flows through accounts in priority order:

1. **Operating costs** — O&M, taxes, insurance
2. **Debt service** — Interest + principal to lenders
3. **Reserve accounts** — Maintenance, debt service reserves
4. **Equity returns** — Dividends to sponsors (residual)

Lenders get paid before equity — that's why PPP debt is lower risk than equity.

## PPP models

| Model | Description | Risk allocation |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BOT** (Build-Operate-Transfer) | Private builds, operates for term, transfers to government | Construction + operation risk to private |
| **BOOT** (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer) | Same as BOT but private owns asset during term | Same + ownership risk |
| **DBFOM** (Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain) | Full lifecycle responsibility | Maximum risk transfer |
| **Availability payment** | Government pays fixed amount regardless of usage | Demand risk stays with government |
| **User fee** (toll) | Private collects tolls/tariffs from users | Demand risk to private |

---

## Revenue sources

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **User fees** | Tolls, tariffs, fares | Toll roads, airports |
| **Availability payments** | Government pays if asset available | Hospitals, prisons |
| **Shadow tolls** | Government pays per user | UK roads |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of user fees + government support | [[Santos-Guarujá Tunnel]] |

## Financing

### Typical capital structure

| Source | Share | Cost | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Senior debt | 70-85% | Lower | Banks or bonds, secured |
| Mezzanine | 0-10% | Medium | Subordinated debt |
| Equity | 15-30% | Higher | Sponsors, infra funds |

### Key investors

- **Pension funds**: CPP, OMERS, AustralianSuper
- **Sovereign wealth**: GIC, ADIA, PIF
- **Infrastructure funds**: Macquarie, Brookfield, [[DigitalBridge]]
- **Development banks**: [[IFC]], IDB Invest, [[BNDES]]
- **Commercial banks**: Project finance divisions

## Government support mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Capital grant** | Upfront subsidy to make project viable |
| **Revenue guarantee** | Minimum revenue floor |
| **Tax incentives** | Tax holidays, accelerated depreciation |
| **Land provision** | Government provides right-of-way |
| **Forex guarantee** | Protection against currency risk (EM) |

## Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Construction** | Cost overruns, delays | Fixed-price EPC, liquidated damages |
| **Demand** | Lower usage than forecast | Availability payments, minimum guarantees |
| **Political** | Contract renegotiation, expropriation | Bilateral investment treaties, MIGA insurance |
| **Currency** | EM currency depreciation | USD-linked tariffs, hedging |
| **Regulatory** | Tariff changes, new requirements | Stabilization clauses |
