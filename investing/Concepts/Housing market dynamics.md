# Housing market dynamics

The relationship between housing activity (existing home sales, new construction, mortgage rates) and downstream consumer spending categories. Mattress purchases correlate strongly with existing home sales — buyers typically replace mattresses when moving. The 2022-2025 housing freeze (driven by elevated mortgage rates and limited inventory) has been a primary demand headwind for mattress companies like [[Sleep Number]], [[Tempur-Sealy International]], and [[Purple Innovation]].
