## Global production

| Country | Feedstock | Volume (2024) | Share |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **US** | Corn | ~60B liters/yr | ~54% |
| **[[Brazil]]** | Sugarcane | ~36B liters/yr | ~30% |
| EU | Wheat, sugar beet | ~6B liters/yr | ~5% |
| Rest of world | Various | ~10B liters/yr | ~11% |

## Blending mandates

| Market | Mandate | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| US | E10 (10% ethanol) standard, E15 expanding | RFS2 mandates 36B gal renewable fuel |
| Brazil | E27 (27% anhydrous ethanol) | Flex-fuel vehicles run E100 |
| EU | RED III renewable transport targets | Favoring advanced biofuels |

## 1G vs 2G

| Dimension | 1G | [[E2G|2G]] |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Feedstock | Corn, sugarcane juice | Bagasse, stover, straw |
| Cost | ~$1.82/gal | $2.17-4.55/gal |
| GHG reduction | 39-52% | ~86% |
| Scale | ~110B liters/yr | <200M liters/yr |
