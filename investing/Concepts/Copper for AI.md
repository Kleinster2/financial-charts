**Copper for AI** — The thesis that AI infrastructure buildout is creating structural copper demand. Data centers, liquid cooling, power grids, EVs all copper-intensive.

---

## The thesis

Copper is the metal of AI infrastructure:

| Use case | Why copper |
|----------|------------|
| Data center power | Dense cabling, busbars, transformers |
| Liquid cooling | Copper heat exchangers, piping |
| Grid upgrades | Transmission, distribution, substations |
| EVs | 3-4x copper vs ICE vehicles |
| Renewables | Wind, solar, storage connections |

**Key insight:** AI isn't just software — it's a physical infrastructure buildout that runs through copper.

---

## Why 2025 is different

The current copper rally differs from past cycles:

| Past rallies | 2025 rally |
|--------------|------------|
| [[China]] construction (2009) | Diversified: AI, EVs, grid, renewables |
| Cyclical | Structural — multi-year buildouts |
| GDP proxy | AI stack proxy |
| Supply could respond | Decade-long mine timelines |

**"Dr. Copper" is now diagnosing AI infrastructure, not just GDP.**

## [[S&P Global]] study (Jan 2026)

**"Copper in the Age of AI"** — landmark study co-chaired by Daniel Yergin (Vice Chairman, [[S&P Global]]).

> "Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper. Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defense are scaling all at once—and supply is not on track to keep pace. **At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.**" — **Daniel Yergin**, Vice Chairman, [[S&P Global]]

The emerging supply deficit constitutes a **"systemic risk for global industries, technological advancement and economic growth."**

> "Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems; the future availability of copper has become a matter of strategic importance." — **Carlos Pascual**, SVP Geopolitics, [[S&P Global]] (co-chair)

### Supply vs demand to 2040

| Metric | 2025 | 2040 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Demand | 28M tonnes | 42M tonnes | +50% |
| Primary production | — | 22M tonnes | — |
| Recycled copper | 4M tonnes | 10M tonnes | +150% |
| **Shortfall** | — | **10M tonnes** | 25% gap |

Production peaks at **33M tonnes in 2030**, then declines (ore grade deterioration).

### 2040 demand breakdown

| Sector | Demand | Share | [[Gap]] contribution |
|--------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Core economic (construction, transport) | 23M tonnes | 53% | — |
| Energy transition (EVs, renewables, grid) | 15.7M tonnes | 37% | — |
| **Subtotal (traditional)** | 38.7M tonnes | — | **7M tonne gap** |
| AI/data centers + defense | ~4M tonnes | 10% | +[[3M]] tonnes |
| Humanoid robots (1B-10B units) | 1.6M+ tonnes | — | Upside risk |

Global electricity demand projected to increase ~50% by 2040.

### Infrastructure scale required

- Data centers: **550 GW by 2040** (5x 2022)
- **100+ new data center projects** launched (~$61B pipeline)
- Equivalent to adding **330 Hoover Dams** or **650 nuclear reactors** annually
- [[Defense]] spending could reach **$6T by 2040**

### Supply concentration risk

| Segment | Concentration |
|---------|---------------|
| Mining production | 6 countries = 67% |
| Smelting capacity | [[China]] = 40% |
| Concentrate imports | [[China]] = 66% |

**New mine timeline: 17 years** discovery to production.

**US designated copper a "critical metal" in 2025.**

> "Bridging the impending supply gap depends not only on geology, engineering, and logistics and investment, but also on governance and policies. That translates into timeliness in permitting and consultation, a time clock on litigation and stability in governance and regulation. The alternative is uncertainty, and uncertainty comes at a hefty cost." — **Eleonor Kramarz**, Global Head Critical Minerals, [[S&P Global]]

### Market mechanism caveat

S&P notes actual deficits remain "hypothetical" — price adjustments influence consumption and supply viability. Higher prices ration demand and incentivize marginal supply. But the scale of projected gap suggests prices must rise substantially.

> "The future is not just copper-intensive, it is copper-enabled. Every new building, every line of digital code, every renewable megawatt, every new car, every advanced weapon system depends on the metal." — **Aurian De La Noue**, Executive Director Critical Minerals, [[S&P Global]]

## Supply crunch dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Mine timelines | **17 years** discovery to production |
| Production peak | 2030 at 33M tonnes, then decline |
| Underinvestment | Years of low capex now biting |
| Permitting | Environmental/community opposition |
| Concentrate shortage | Smelters paying higher fees |

**The problem:** Demand can surge in months. Supply takes nearly two decades.

---

## Demand drivers

### Data centers
- Hyperscale facilities require miles of high-capacity cabling
- Liquid cooling adoption increases copper intensity per rack
- AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) run hotter → more cooling copper
- Multi-year buildout commitments lock in demand
- **[[JPMorgan]] (Jan 2026):** Data center demand **475K tons in 2026** (up from 110K in 2025) — "inelastic demand"
- [[Wood Mackenzie]]: "When developers require copper for data centers, it is used with little concern for the copper price"

### Grid infrastructure
- AI data centers need massive grid upgrades
- Transmission bottlenecks require new lines
- Substations, transformers all copper-heavy
- [[Power constraints]] = more grid investment

### Electrification
- EVs: 50-80 kg copper per vehicle (vs 20 kg for ICE)
- Charging infrastructure
- Renewable connections
- Battery storage systems

## Price dynamics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current price (Jan 29, 2026) | **$13,900/tonne** (hit $14,500 intraday) |
| Jan 29 move | **+6.1%** (biggest single day in 16+ years) |
| April 2025 | $8,000/tonne |
| Move since April | +75% in 10 months |
| All-time high | **$14,500/t** (Jan 29, 2026 intraday) |
| S&P incentive price | $12,000+ needed for new supply |

**Jan 29 rally:** Chinese speculative frenzy (record SHFE volumes), USD at 4-year lows. But COMEX inventories topped 500K tons (record) and LME at highest since May 2025 — inventories contradict scarcity narrative. StoneX: "fundamentals certainly do not support copper at current levels."

---

## Bull case

- AI infrastructure demand is structural, not cyclical
- Supply cannot respond quickly (decade-long projects)
- Electrification adds to baseload demand
- Underinvestment catching up
- Policy tailwinds (reshoring, energy security)
- Lower rates = cheaper to hold inventory

---

## Bear case / Risks

- 1990s fiber optic parallel — capacity can overshoot
- Speculative excess in "AI metals" theme
- Demand assumptions may prove too optimistic
- Substitution if prices stay high
- Recession risk dampens industrial demand
- [[China]] slowdown (still major consumer)

**The Copper Journal's John Gross** warns of parallels to 1990s fiberoptic boom.

## Key miners

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | FCX | Largest public copper producer |
| [[Southern Copper]] | SCCO | Low-cost, high-margin |
| [[Codelco]] | State-owned | World's largest ([[Chile]]) |
| [[BHP]] | [[BHP]] | Diversified, major copper |

---

## Investment approach

**What to watch:**
1. AI infrastructure spending pace (validates demand)
2. 2026 supply crunch severity
3. New project permitting timelines
4. Substitution trends at high prices

**Strategy considerations:**
- Low-cost producers thrive across cycles
- High-cost producers vulnerable to downturns
- Royalty/streaming companies for exposure with less risk
- Copper ETFs for broad exposure

## Macro context

Copper rallying alongside gold and silver:

| Metal | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| [[Gold]] | [[Inflation]] hedge, central bank buying |
| [[Silver]] | Industrial + monetary (137% in 2025) |
| Copper | AI infrastructure + electrification |

**Dual identity:** Growth asset AND quasi-inflation hedge.
