**Copper for AI** — The thesis that AI infrastructure buildout is creating structural copper demand. Data centers, liquid cooling, power grids, EVs all copper-intensive.

---

## The thesis

Copper is the metal of AI infrastructure:

| Use case | Why copper |
|----------|------------|
| Data center power | Dense cabling, busbars, transformers |
| Liquid cooling | Copper heat exchangers, piping |
| Grid upgrades | Transmission, distribution, substations |
| EVs | 3-4x copper vs ICE vehicles |
| Renewables | Wind, solar, storage connections |

**Key insight:** AI isn't just software — it's a physical infrastructure buildout that runs through copper.

---

## Why 2025 is different

The current copper rally differs from past cycles:

| Past rallies | 2025 rally |
|--------------|------------|
| China construction (2009) | Diversified: AI, EVs, grid, renewables |
| Cyclical | Structural — multi-year buildouts |
| GDP proxy | AI stack proxy |
| Supply could respond | Decade-long mine timelines |

**"Dr. Copper" is now diagnosing AI infrastructure, not just GDP.**

---

## Supply crunch dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Mine timelines | 10+ years discovery to production |
| Underinvestment | Years of low capex now biting |
| Permitting | Environmental/community opposition |
| Concentrate shortage | Smelters paying higher fees |
| 2026 crunch | Market expects acute squeeze |

**The problem:** Demand can surge in months. Supply takes a decade.

## Demand drivers

### Data centers
- Hyperscale facilities require miles of high-capacity cabling
- Liquid cooling adoption increases copper intensity per rack
- AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) run hotter → more cooling copper
- Multi-year buildout commitments lock in demand

### Grid infrastructure
- AI data centers need massive grid upgrades
- Transmission bottlenecks require new lines
- Substations, transformers all copper-heavy
- [[Power constraints]] = more grid investment

### Electrification
- EVs: 50-80 kg copper per vehicle (vs 20 kg for ICE)
- Charging infrastructure
- Renewable connections
- Battery storage systems

## Price dynamics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 performance | ~20%+ rally |
| Context | Best year since 2009 |
| Current price | Near record highs |
| Bull target | $12,000/ton |
| Structural deficit | Widening |

---

## Bull case

- AI infrastructure demand is structural, not cyclical
- Supply cannot respond quickly (decade-long projects)
- Electrification adds to baseload demand
- Underinvestment catching up
- Policy tailwinds (reshoring, energy security)
- Lower rates = cheaper to hold inventory

---

## Bear case / Risks

- 1990s fiber optic parallel — capacity can overshoot
- Speculative excess in "AI metals" theme
- Demand assumptions may prove too optimistic
- Substitution if prices stay high
- Recession risk dampens industrial demand
- China slowdown (still major consumer)

**The Copper Journal's John Gross** warns of parallels to 1990s fiberoptic boom.

## Key miners

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | FCX | Largest public copper producer |
| [[Southern Copper]] | SCCO | Low-cost, high-margin |
| Codelco | State-owned | World's largest (Chile) |
| BHP | BHP | Diversified, major copper |
| Rio Tinto | RIO | Diversified, growing copper |
| Antofagasta | ANTO.L | Pure-play Chile |
| First Quantum | FM.TO | Cobre Panama disruption |
| Teck Resources | TECK | Copper growth story |

---

## Investment approach

**What to watch:**
1. AI infrastructure spending pace (validates demand)
2. 2026 supply crunch severity
3. New project permitting timelines
4. Substitution trends at high prices

**Strategy considerations:**
- Low-cost producers thrive across cycles
- High-cost producers vulnerable to downturns
- Royalty/streaming companies for exposure with less risk
- Copper ETFs for broad exposure

## Macro context

Copper rallying alongside gold and silver:

| Metal | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| Gold | Inflation hedge, central bank buying |
| Silver | Industrial + monetary (137% in 2025) |
| Copper | AI infrastructure + electrification |

**Dual identity:** Growth asset AND quasi-inflation hedge.
