**Drone warfare** — Military drones are reshaping defense economics. The "attritable" philosophy inverts the cost equation: cheap, expendable, AI-enabled systems vs. expensive manned platforms. Ukraine validated; now every major military is scaling.

## The cost asymmetry

| Platform | Unit cost | Philosophy |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| F-35 | ~$80M | Must survive every mission |
| Reaper (MQ-9) | ~$30M | Expensive, limited numbers |
| **Valkyrie (XQ-58)** | ~$3M | Designed to be lost |
| **Switchblade 600** | ~$50K | One-use, anti-armor |
| **FPV drone (Ukraine)** | ~$500 | Disposable, mass-produced |

**The math:** For the cost of one F-35, you get 26 Valkyries or 1,600 Switchblades. Quantity has a quality all its own.

## Ukraine as proving ground

Ukraine validated drone warfare as decisive, not supplementary:

| Lesson | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| FPV drones | $500 drones destroying $5M vehicles (10,000:1 cost ratio) |
| Switchblade | 700+ sent; mixed results but validated concept |
| Naval drones | Ukraine's sea drones sank/damaged Russian Black Sea Fleet |
| Counter-drone | Electronic warfare now as important as the drones themselves |
| Attrition math | Lose 80% of drones, still profitable if target is expensive |

**Production scale:** Ukraine producing ~50,000 FPV drones/month domestically. The "drone as munition" paradigm is established.

## Demand drivers (Jan 2026)

| Driver | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| [[Golden Dome]] | 10,000-drone threat scenario modeled; backlog driver for US drone makers |
| EU defense | **3M drones/year** needed to hold Lithuania in wider Russia war (Kubilius est.) |
| US CCA program | Collaborative Combat Aircraft — AI wingmen for manned fighters |
| Pacific contingency | Anti-access/area denial needs mass autonomous systems |
| Export demand | Allies buying loitering munitions, ISR drones |

Drone business "red hot" — backlogs surging (William Blair, Jan 2026).

## Key players

### US

| Company | Focus | Valuation (Jan 2026) |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| [[AeroVironment]] | Small UAS (Puma, Raven), loitering munitions (Switchblade) | $312, 90x 2026E |
| [[Kratos]] | Attritable tactical drones (Valkyrie), hypersonic targets | $114, 106x 2027E |
| [[Anduril]] | Autonomous systems (Fury, Altius), AI software | Private, ~$30B |
| General Atomics | Large MALE drones (MQ-9 Reaper, MQ-1C Gray Eagle) | Private |
| Shield AI | Autonomous aircraft (V-BAT) | Private |

### Europe

| Company | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[Helsing]] | AI-powered drones (HX-2), autonomous combat vehicles | €12B, manufacturing 6,000 for Ukraine |
| Baykar (Turkey) | Bayraktar TB2/Akinci — pioneered affordable combat drones | Private, iconic Ukraine role |
| Dassault/Airbus | Eurodrone MALE program | Development |

### China

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Humanoid/drone exhibitors at CES 2026 | **21 of 38** were Chinese |
| Drone patents (5 years) | **7,705** (vs US 1,561) |
| Companies | 150+ in military/commercial drone space |
| DJI global commercial share | ~70% (sanctions pressure growing) |

China leads in patent volume and manufacturing scale. Military drone exports to Middle East, Africa, SE Asia growing rapidly.

## Categories

| Type | Examples | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **Loitering munitions** | Switchblade, Harop, Lancet | One-way attack, anti-armor/personnel |
| **Attritable tactical** | Valkyrie, Fury, Loyal Wingman | AI wingman, expendable mass |
| **ISR/reconnaissance** | Puma, Raven, ScanEagle | Persistent surveillance |
| **MALE** | MQ-9 Reaper, Akinci, Eurodrone | Long-endurance strike/ISR |
| **Swarm** | Developmental | Coordinated mass, overwhelm defenses |
| **Naval/maritime** | Ukrainian sea drones | Anti-ship, mine countermeasures |
| **Counter-drone** | EW systems, laser interceptors | Drone-on-drone defense |

## Counter-drone problem

Every drone capability creates counter-drone demand:

| Approach | Technology | Players |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Electronic warfare | GPS/comms jamming | L3Harris, Northrop |
| Directed energy | Laser/HPM | RTX, Lockheed |
| Kinetic | Small missiles, shotguns | RTX (Coyote), Rafael (Iron Dome) |
| Detection | Radar, RF sensing, acoustic | Multiple |

**Cost asymmetry inverts:** A $500 FPV drone shouldn't be countered with a $1M missile. Counter-drone economics favor EW and directed energy.

## Investment lens

**Bull:**
- Ukraine validated drone warfare as decisive capability
- Golden Dome + CCA driving US backlogs
- EU needs 3M drones/year — current capacity is a fraction
- Attritable concept expanding from drones to other platforms
- AI autonomy makes drones increasingly capable without operators

**Bear:**
- Valuations extreme (AVAV 90x, KTOS 106x — pricier than NVIDIA)
- Counter-drone tech could neutralize drone advantage
- Primes entering market (Boeing, Northrop, Lockheed)
- Export controls limit market access
- Technology commoditizing (China's patent/manufacturing lead)

**Sector performance:** Defense +55% past year. Drone pure-plays outperforming even that.
