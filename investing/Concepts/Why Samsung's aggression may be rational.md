[[Samsung]]'s "leapfrog" behavior reflects structural position, not organizational dysfunction.

## The math of being #2

- ~12% market share vs [[TSMC]]'s ~60%
- Incremental improvement cannot close this gap
- Customer switching costs favor the incumbent

## Viable paths to relevance

1. **Radical cost advantage** — unlikely given similar equipment costs
2. **Node leadership** — risky but potentially game-changing
3. **Geopolitical constraints on TSMC** — exogenous but real option

## Conglomerate advantage

Samsung's foundry can pursue high-variance strategies because:
- Memory/display divisions absorb losses
- Patient capital from profitable siblings
- No existential threat from foundry failure

## Reframing

The [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] looks like recklessness. It may be **rational asymmetric betting** — the only play available from Samsung's position.
