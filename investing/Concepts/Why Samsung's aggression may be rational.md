#concept #strategy #samsung

[[Samsung]]'s "leapfrog" behavior reflects structural position, not organizational dysfunction. And TSMC's capacity constraints are now validating this bet.

> **Key insight:** Being #2 in foundry requires high-variance strategies. Patience from #2 position = permanent irrelevance.

---

## The math of being #2

| Metric | Samsung | TSMC |
|--------|---------|------|
| Market share | ~12% | ~60% |
| Advanced logic share | ~5% | ~90% |
| Customer switching costs | Work against you | Work for you |
| Optimal strategy | Offense | [[Defense]] |

Incremental improvement cannot close this gap. Only asymmetric bets can.

## Viable paths to relevance

1. **Radical cost advantage** — unlikely given similar equipment costs
2. **Node leadership** — risky but potentially game-changing (SF2 push)
3. **Geopolitical constraints on TSMC** — exogenous but real option
4. **TSMC capacity overflow** — now happening (Jan 2026)

## The overflow opportunity (Jan 2026)

TSMC's capacity constraints are creating "spill-off" customers:

| Customer | Product | Why Samsung |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| [[Meta]] | MTIA ASICs | TSMC bottlenecked |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Mobile SoCs | Diversification |
| [[AMD]] | CPUs/GPUs | Capacity access |

**What's happening:**
- TSMC raising 2nm prices + demand surge
- Customers can't get capacity on time
- Samsung SF2 process now "a serious option"
- [[Intel]] 18A/14A also seeing interest

**The thesis validation:** Samsung's aggression positioned them to capture overflow. Patience would have meant missing this window.

---

## Conglomerate advantage

Samsung's foundry can pursue high-variance strategies because:
- Memory/display divisions absorb losses
- Patient capital from profitable siblings
- No existential threat from foundry failure

---

## SF2 process status

| Metric | SF2 (Samsung 2nm) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Architecture | GAA (Gate-All-Around) |
| Status | Ramping 2026 |
| Yields | Improving (still behind TSMC) |
| [[Target]] customers | TSMC overflow |

---

## Reframing

The [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] looks like recklessness. It may be **rational asymmetric betting** — the only play available from Samsung's position.

**Jan 2026 evidence:** Meta, Qualcomm, AMD exploring Samsung = the bet is paying off.

---

## Investment implications

**For Samsung:**
- Overflow customers = validation of aggressive strategy
- SF2 yields are the key variable
- Even partial success changes the narrative

**For TSMC:**
- Capacity constraints = pricing power but customer frustration
- 2nm price increases may accelerate diversification
- Still dominant, but monopoly cracking at edges

**For [[Intel]]:**
- 18A/14A also seeing interest from same dynamic
- US-based manufacturing attractive to US fabless
- Execution still the question mark
