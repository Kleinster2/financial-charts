**Private markets** — Companies that haven't gone public. Historically outperformed public markets but inaccessible to retail. Tokenization changing this.

## Why private markets matter

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Performance | Private equity outperformed public for 25 years |
| Access | Historically limited to institutions, accredited |
| AI companies | Best AI companies are private (OpenAI, Anthropic) |
| Staying private longer | Companies IPO later, retail misses growth |

---

## The access problem

**Retail locked out of wealth creation:**

| Stage | Who benefits |
|-------|--------------|
| Seed/Series A | VCs, angels |
| Growth rounds | PE, growth equity |
| Pre-IPO | Institutions, secondaries |
| IPO | Finally retail — but insiders cashing out |

**Quote:** "Retail gets the exhaust."

| Tokenization | [[Robinhood]], Republic | Retail (derivative) |

## Tokenization disruption

**New approach for retail access:**
- Not actual equity — derivative exposure
- [[Robinhood]] offering OpenAI/SpaceX tokens (Europe)
- [[Republic]] SpaceX token
- Lower minimums, tradeable

## Why companies stay private

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Disclosure burden | SEC filings, transparency |
| Quarterly pressure | Short-term focus |
| Cost | Compliance, legal, accounting |
| Control | Founders retain power |
| Capital available | Plenty of private capital |

**Result:** Best companies stay private longer → retail locked out.

## Regulatory framework

| Regulation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Reg D | Accredited investors only |
| Reg CF | Crowdfunding, up to $5M |
| Reg A+ | Mini-IPO, up to $75M |
