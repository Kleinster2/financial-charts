# Small cap rotation 2026

**"Great Rotation"** — Money flowing from large cap tech into small caps. Russell 2000 +5.8% YTD vs Nasdaq +2.0%. Strongest small cap start in a decade.

## The setup

| Metric | Small caps (R2K) | Large caps (S&P) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Forward P/E | 18x | 26x |
| Valuation gap | **25-year extreme** | — |
| YTD 2026 | +5.8% | +3% |
| Rate sensitivity | High | Low |

Small caps had been left behind during 2023-2025 AI rally. Valuation gap widened to levels not seen since dot-com era.

---

## Catalysts

### 1. AI disruption fears (Feb 2026)

[[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026]] triggered $285B selloff in software/tech. Large cap tech exposed to AI displacement narrative. Small caps largely immune.

| Index | Feb 3-4 move |
|-------|--------------|
| Nasdaq | -1.7% |
| Russell 2000 | +0.5% |

**Same catalyst, opposite trades.**

### 2. "America First" industrial policy

Trump administration emphasis on domestic manufacturing, defense spending:
- Defense contractors (Kratos, etc.)
- Domestic manufacturing
- Reshoring beneficiaries

Small caps = more domestic revenue exposure.

### 3. Fed accommodation

Small caps more rate-sensitive. Fed pause/cuts benefit:
- Higher leverage ratios
- More floating rate debt
- Regional bank exposure

### 4. Valuation mean reversion

25-year valuation gap was unsustainable. Historical pattern: after extended large cap outperformance, small caps catch up (see 2000-2006).

## Historical parallels

| Period | Setup | Outcome |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 2000-2006 | Post dot-com, tech crashed | R2K +80%, S&P +15% |
| 2016-2017 | Post-election rotation | R2K led for 6 months |
| **2026** | Post-AI bubble rotation? | TBD |

## Bull case

- Valuation gap at 25-year extreme — mean reversion overdue
- AI disruption narrative benefits "old economy" names
- Domestic policy tailwinds (tariffs, reshoring)
- Fed accommodation helps rate-sensitive names
- Rotation has room to run (historically lasts 2-3 years)

## Bear case

- Economic slowdown hits small caps harder (higher leverage)
- ADP miss (+22K) suggests labor weakness
- Small caps more exposed to regional bank stress
- Rotation could reverse if AI fears fade
- Quality tilt still favors large caps
