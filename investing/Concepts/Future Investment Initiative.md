## Significance

FII serves as Saudi Arabia's primary platform for global investor engagement — the soft-power complement to PIF's hard capital. Regular attendees include CEOs of [[BlackRock]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Citigroup]], and other major financial institutions. The 2018 edition was boycotted by many Western executives after the Khashoggi killing, but attendance has since recovered.

FII PRIORITY Miami launched as a secondary event, with the 2025 edition inaugurated by President Trump.
