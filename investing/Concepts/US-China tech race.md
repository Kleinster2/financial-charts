| **2026E** | +15% | **+20%** |
| **2027E** | +15% | **+22%** |

**2026 = crossover** — China tech earnings growth overtakes Mag 7 for first time since 2022.

China Tech 8: [[Alibaba]], [[Baidu]], [[Tencent]], NetEase, PDD, [[Xiaomi]], JD, [[Meituan]]

### Drivers
- [[TSMC]] revenue beat
- [[Samsung]] Q4 profit tripled (record)
- Chinese AI IPOs ([[Zhipu]], [[MiniMax]])
- Big Tech capex: +34% to ~$440B (benefits [[Asia]] supply chain)

### Analyst views
- **[[Goldman Sachs]]:** Overweight [[Asia]] tech
- **Citi:** Global long-term investors accumulating
- **Pepperstone:** "US tech is like a mature gold mine... Asian tech is an under-explored mine"
