**Thermal Limits** — Air cooling hitting physical limits. Liquid cooling becoming mandatory for AI.

---

## The thesis

AI chips are too hot for air:

| Chip | TDP | Cooling need |
|------|-----|--------------|
| H100 | 700W | Pushing air limits |
| Blackwell | 1000W+ | Liquid required |
| Next gen | Higher | Liquid standard |

---

## Why liquid cooling?

| Factor | Air | Liquid |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Heat transfer | 1x | 10-100x better |
| Density | Limited | More GPUs/rack |
| Efficiency | PUE 1.4+ | PUE <1.2 |
| Noise | Loud | Quieter |
| Cost | Lower upfront | Lower operating |

---

## Winners

| Company | Ticker | Angle |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Modine Manufacturing]] | MOD | Liquid cooling specialist (+150% 2024) |
| [[Vertiv]] | VRT | DC infrastructure |
| [[Super Micro Computer]] | SMCI | Liquid-cooled servers |
| [[Schneider Electric]] | SBGSY | Power + cooling |

---

## The inflection

**2024-2025:**
- Modine +150%
- Supermicro leading on liquid racks
- Hyperscalers mandating liquid
- Retrofit demand rising

---

## Data center impact

**Operators must adapt:**
- Retrofit existing DCs
- New builds = liquid-ready
- Plumbing infrastructure
- Maintenance complexity

---

## Investment implications

**Long liquid cooling:**
- [[Modine Manufacturing]] — pure play
- [[Vertiv]] — broad DC exposure
- Cooling specialists

**Risks for:**
- Air-cooled only DC operators
- Legacy infrastructure
- Water-scarce locations (Phoenix, [[Querétaro]])

---

## Water challenge

**Liquid cooling = water use:**
- Some systems use water
- Water-scarce regions concerned
- Closed-loop systems emerging
- [[Trade]]-off: thermal vs water

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| H100 TDP | 700W |
| Blackwell TDP | 1000W+ |
| Modine 2024 | +150% |
| Liquid vs air | 10-100x better cooling |
