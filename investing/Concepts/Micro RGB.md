# Micro RGB

**Micro RGB** — Samsung's new LCD backlighting technology. Uses individual red, green, and blue backlights instead of white/blue. Announced CES 2026.

## How it works

**Traditional LCD:**
- White or blue backlight behind panel
- Color filters create RGB colors
- Limits color purity and realism

**Micro RGB:**
- Individual R, G, B backlights
- Smaller, discrete light sources
- Each color generated directly
- Improved color accuracy and gamut

## Products (CES 2026)

| Size | Price | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 115-inch | **$30,000** | Available (Sept 2025) |
| 55-130 inch | TBD | Coming 2026 |

Still premium-priced above OLED and Neo QLED (Mini LED).

## Technology positioning

| Technology | Backlight | Price tier |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| LCD | White/blue | Budget |
| Mini LED (Neo QLED) | Mini LED zones | Mid-premium |
| **Micro RGB** | Individual RGB | Premium |
| OLED | Self-emissive pixels | Premium |
| Micro LED | Self-emissive micro LEDs | Ultra-premium |

Micro RGB sits between Mini LED and OLED — better color than Mini LED, different tradeoffs vs OLED.

## vs OLED

| Factor | Micro RGB | OLED |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Color accuracy | Excellent | Excellent |
| Black levels | Good (LCD limitation) | Perfect (pixels off) |
| Brightness | Very high | Improving (35%+ YoY) |
| Burn-in risk | None | Possible |
| Price | High | High |

**Samsung's pitch:** Micro RGB offers OLED-like color without OLED's burn-in risk.

## Investment relevance

**Samsung differentiation:**
- Proprietary technology
- Competes with LG's OLED dominance
- Could expand to other display applications

**Early stage:** Currently very expensive. Mass market impact TBD.
