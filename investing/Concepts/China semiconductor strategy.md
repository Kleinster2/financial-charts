**China semiconductor strategy** — China's dual approach to semiconductor self-sufficiency: **defensively** building a domestic ecosystem to withstand foreign sanctions, and **offensively** leveraging mature-node manufacturing to create new global dependencies. Powered by >$150B in state-directed capital through the "Big Fund" and broader industrial policy.

## The dual strategy

| Mode | Goal | Mechanism |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Defensive** | Self-reliant ecosystem | Domestic foundries ([[SMIC]]), memory (YMTC, CXMT), equipment ([[NAURA Technology]], AMEC) |
| **Offensive** | Global mature-node dominance | Flood market with mature-node capacity for EVs, renewables, consumer electronics |

Full self-sufficiency in leading-edge by 2030 is **impossible**. But dominance in mature segments (28nm+) is achievable and strategically potent — these chips go into everything from cars to industrial equipment.

## Made in China 2025

Launched 2015 by Premier Li Keqiang. Semiconductors categorized under "advanced information technology" as a technology of paramount importance.

- **Target:** 70% domestic self-sufficiency in core components by 2025
- **Reality:** Target widely acknowledged as unattainable in original timeframe
- **Impact:** Served as signal of intent, triggering massive resource mobilization

Xi Jinping (2014): semiconductors are a "core technology that China should produce domestically."

## The Big Fund

The National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund — the financial engine. Equity stakes in domestic companies rather than direct subsidies.

| Phase | Period | Capital | Focus |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| I | 2014-2019 | **$21.8B** | Manufacturing scale. 60-70% to front-end wafer fab. [[SMIC]], YMTC, CXMT |
| II | 2019-2024 | **$35B** | More targeted — equipment, materials, packaging. Conservative after Phase I failures |
| III | 2024-2029 | **$47.5B** | Bottlenecks: equipment, advanced materials, [[HBM]]. Response to escalating US restrictions |
| **Total** | | **>$95B** | + catalyzed multiples more in provincial/private investment |

The influence extends far beyond direct capital — Big Fund investments signal state backing, unlocking additional private and provincial capital.

## China's semiconductor market

| Year | Market size | Growth |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2024 | **$227.2B** | +21.9% YoY |
| 2029 (projected) | **$413.6B** | Nearly doubles |

Accounts for over half of the entire Asia-Pacific semiconductor market.

## Key domestic players

| Company | Role | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[SMIC]] | Foundry (leading domestic) | Several generations behind [[TSMC]] |
| YMTC | NAND memory | Under US entity list restrictions |
| CXMT | DRAM memory | Ramping domestic capacity |
| [[NAURA Technology]] | Equipment (etch, deposition, thermal) | National champion, ~50% YoY growth |
| AMEC | Equipment (etch) | Growing but still small vs global leaders |

## The self-sufficiency math

Full semiconductor self-sufficiency (all steps from EDA to testing) would cost **$900B-$1.2T** in R&D + capex — **6× the total industry R&D + capex in 2019**. This is why global cooperation remains the economically rational solution, and why the US-China tech war is so costly for both sides.

## The paradox for Western equipment makers

US export controls create a short-term bonanza for companies like [[Lam Research]] (China = 35% of revenue) as Chinese fabs rush to buy tools before restrictions tighten. But the long-term goal of China's investment is to **replace** these foreign suppliers with domestic alternatives. The current revenue surge may be a "sugar high" masking strategic risk.
