**Wearable AI** — The race to put AI on your face, finger, and body. Meta leads in smart glasses, but 70+ Chinese companies are chasing. Form factors: glasses, rings, health monitors, gesture controllers.

## The thesis

AI is moving from phone to body:

| Form factor | Use case | Leaders |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Smart glasses | Always-on AI assistant, camera, display | [[Meta]] (Ray-Ban), Google |
| Smart rings | Health, gestures, translation | Chinese startups, Samsung |
| Health monitors | Continuous biometrics | Apple, Oura, Chinese |
| Gesture controllers | Hands-free computing | Various |

**Key insight:** Wearables enable AI to see/hear what you see/hear — unlocks context that phones can't provide.

## Meta's smart glasses strategy

**Ray-Ban Meta (2023+):**
- Partnership with EssilorLuxottica
- Camera + audio + Meta AI
- Best-selling smart glasses ever
- Consumer-friendly form factor

**Orion (prototype):**
- Full AR glasses with holographic display
- Developer/demo stage
- Years from consumer release

**Strategy:** Start with audio/camera glasses → graduate to full AR.

## China's 70+ wearable entrants

CNBC reports 70+ Chinese companies developing AI wearables:

| Device | Company | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| DingTalk A1 | Alibaba/DingTalk | Voice notes, transcription, 26ft range |
| Native Language Star | Le Le Gaoshang | Chinese-English translation for education |
| Various smart glasses | Multiple | Meta clones + differentiated |

**China's edge:**
- Manufacturing expertise
- Lower costs
- Faster iteration
- Huge domestic market
- AI integration focus

---

## Emerging form factors

**Smart rings** may beat glasses:

| Advantage | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Social acceptance | No camera pointing at people |
| Always-on | Sleep, shower, exercise |
| Health sensors | Pulse ox, temperature, HRV |
| Gesture control | Natural interaction |
| Translation | Discreet use |

Pulse oximeters already use finger contact — ring is natural evolution.

## Google Glass lesson

Google Glass (2012-2015) failed because:
- Too nerdy/conspicuous
- "Glasshole" social stigma
- Camera creepiness
- Too expensive ($1,500)
- No killer app

**What's different now:**
- Ray-Ban Meta looks like normal glasses
- AI provides actual utility
- Camera is expected (phones everywhere)
- Lower prices possible

---

## Investment angles

**Direct plays:**
| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Meta]] | Ray-Ban glasses, Orion AR |
| [[Apple]] | Vision Pro, Watch, future glasses |
| [[Google]] | Glass history, Android XR |
| EssilorLuxottica | Meta partner |
| Qualcomm | AR/VR chips |

**Picks & shovels:**
| Component | Companies |
|-----------|-----------|
| Micro-displays | Sony, BOE |
| Sensors | ST, Bosch, TDK |
| Audio | Knowles, Cirrus |
| Batteries | Various |
| AI chips | Qualcomm, MediaTek |

---

## Bull case

- Always-on AI assistant = killer app
- Camera context enables new use cases
- China competition drives innovation/lower prices
- Health monitoring creates stickiness
- Enterprise applications (translation, field service)
- Form factor innovation (rings, patches)

---

## Bear case

- Social acceptance still uncertain
- Privacy concerns (always-on cameras)
- Battery life constraints
- Display technology not ready for all-day
- Phone may remain primary device
- Google Glass failure fresh in memory

---

## China vs Meta

| Factor | China | Meta |
|--------|-------|------|
| Manufacturing | Advantage | Dependent |
| Cost | Lower | Premium |
| Speed | Faster iteration | Slower |
| AI integration | Focus area | Leading |
| Brand | Weak globally | Strong |
| Distribution | China + emerging | Global |

**Risk for Meta:** Chinese devices good enough at half the price.

## What to watch

1. Ray-Ban Meta sales trajectory
2. Orion timeline to consumer
3. Apple glasses launch
4. Chinese entrant breakout (the "DeepSeek of wearables")
5. Enterprise adoption
6. Ring form factor traction
