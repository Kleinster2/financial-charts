## Scale

| Unit | Equivalent | Typical use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| kWh | 1,000 Wh | Household electricity bill |
| MWh | 1,000 kWh | Commercial/industrial |
| GWh | 1,000 MWh | Power plant output |
| **TWh** | **1,000 GWh** | **National grids, hyperscaler demand** |

## Context (2024-2025)

| Reference point | TWh |
|-----------------|-----|
| US total electricity generation | ~4,200 TWh/yr |
| Global electricity generation | ~30,000 TWh/yr |
| Global data center electricity | ~500 TWh/yr (growing ~15-20%/yr) |
| [[Raizen]] biomass co-generation | 2.1 TWh/yr |
| Single 1 GW nuclear plant | ~7.9 TWh/yr (at 90% capacity factor) |

1 GW running continuously for a year = ~8.76 TWh.
