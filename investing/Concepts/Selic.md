**Selic** — Brazil's policy interest rate, set by COPOM ([[Banco Central do Brasil|BCB]]'s monetary policy committee). The overnight rate on government securities repos. [[CDI]] tracks Selic closely. Among highest real rates globally.

---

## Definition

Selic (Sistema Especial de Liquidação e de Custódia) has two related meanings:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Selic target** | Policy rate set by COPOM (8 meetings/year) |
| **Selic effective** | Actual overnight rate on gov't securities repos |

The effective rate typically equals the target. BCB conducts open market operations to maintain alignment.

---

## Current level

| Date | Selic target |
|------|--------------|
| Feb 2026 | 15.00% |

COPOM hiked aggressively through 2024-2025 (10.75% → 15%) and is now holding. No easing imminent — COPOM signaling any future cuts will be cautious and data-dependent. Market consensus expects ~12% by year-end 2026, but election-year fiscal uncertainty clouds the path. See [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]] for corporate impact.

## COPOM (Monetary Policy Committee)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Members | 9 (BCB president + 8 directors) |
| Meetings | 8 per year (every ~45 days) |
| Decision | Majority vote |
| Communication | Statement same day, minutes 6 days later |
| Guidance | Forward guidance on likely path |

COPOM targets IPCA inflation (headline CPI). Current target: 3% ± 1.5pp.

## Historical context

| Period | Selic | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 1999 | 45% | Post-Real Plan crisis |
| 2003 | 26.5% | Lula transition |
| 2012-2013 | 7.25% | Historical low |
| 2016 | 14.25% | Dilma impeachment |
| 2020 | 2.00% | COVID emergency cut |
| 2022-2023 | 13.75% | Post-COVID tightening |
| 2025-2026 | 12-15% | Inflation fighting cycle |

Brazil has never had sustained low rates — structural factors (fiscal, indexation) keep real rates high.

## Relationship to other rates

| Rate | Relationship to Selic |
|------|----------------------|
| [[CDI]] | Tracks Selic very closely (few bp below) |
| [[Cupom cambial]] | Selic minus expected FX depreciation |
| DI futures | Market expectations of future Selic path |
| IPCA+ bonds | Real rate = nominal Selic expectation minus inflation |

### Why CDI ≈ Selic

Both are overnight unsecured interbank rates:
- **Selic**: Repos collateralized by government securities
- **CDI**: Unsecured interbank deposits

Spread is minimal because credit risk between major banks is negligible overnight.

## Impact on markets

### Equities

High Selic = headwind for equities:
- Risk-free rate competes with equity returns
- Higher discount rate reduces valuations
- Debt service costs rise for leveraged companies

### Fixed income

High Selic = attractive carry:
- Foreign investors earn high nominal yields
- But currency risk offsets (BRL volatility)
- [[Cross-currency basis]] affects hedged returns

### Derivatives

DI futures at [[B3]] = most liquid interest rate market in LatAm:
- Curve extends 10+ years
- Hedge funds actively trade rate expectations
- Volume rises with volatility

## Real rate context

Brazil's real rate (Selic minus inflation) among highest globally:

| Country | Policy rate | Inflation | Real rate |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| [[Brazil]] | 15.00% | ~4.3% | ~10.7% |
| [[Mexico]] | 10.00% | ~4% | ~6% |
| US | 4.50% | ~3% | ~1.5% |

High real rates reflect:
- Fiscal credibility concerns
- Inflation indexation legacy
- History of default/restructuring
- Shallow domestic savings

---

## Forward guidance

COPOM provides explicit forward guidance:
- "Expects to raise rates by X bp at next meeting"
- "Sees need for significantly contractionary policy"
- "Will remain vigilant on inflation expectations"

Markets react sharply to guidance changes — COPOM communication is key event.
