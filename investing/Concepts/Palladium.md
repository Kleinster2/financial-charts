**Palladium** — industrial precious metal, primarily used in gasoline vehicle catalytic converters. Had a parabolic run from $500 (2016) to $3,000 (2022), now back to ~$950.

## Key dynamics

### Supply concentration

| Country | Share |
|---------|-------|
| Russia | ~40% |
| South Africa | ~35% |
| Canada | ~10% |
| US | ~5% |

**Russia dominance:** Norilsk Nickel produces ~40% of global supply. Sanctions fears drove the 2022 spike, though Russian supply has continued flowing.

### Demand breakdown

| Use | Share |
|-----|-------|
| Autocatalysts | ~85% |
| Electronics | ~5% |
| Dental | ~3% |
| Other | ~7% |

Far more concentrated in autos than platinum — makes it highly levered to gasoline vehicle production.

### The 2016-2022 supercycle

| Year | Price | Driver |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2016 | $500 | Base |
| 2018 | $1,100 | Tightening emissions standards |
| 2020 | $2,700 | COVID supply disruption |
| 2022 | $3,000 | Russia invasion fears |
| 2024 | $1,000 | Substitution, EV transition |
| Current | ~$950 | Normalization |

**What happened:** Gasoline vehicles need 2-4g palladium per car. Tightening emissions standards (China 6, Euro 6d) increased loadings just as supply struggled. Russia invasion fears spiked prices further.

### Substitution to platinum

At $3,000/oz, automakers accelerated platinum substitution:
- Takes 2-3 years to re-engineer catalysts
- Now cost-competitive with platinum at ~$950
- Some demand permanently lost

### EV transition headwind

Same structural issue as platinum — EVs don't need catalysts. But palladium is MORE exposed:
- 85% of demand is auto (vs 40% for platinum)
- No hydrogen fuel cell upside (platinum has this)
- Gasoline vehicles declining faster than diesel in some markets

### Deficit/surplus dynamics

Palladium ran deficits for years, depleting above-ground stocks. Now:
- Substitution reducing demand
- Russian supply still flowing
- Moving toward surplus
