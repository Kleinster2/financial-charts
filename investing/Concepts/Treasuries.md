# Treasuries

US Treasury securities—the benchmark "risk-free" asset class. Backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, they set the floor for all other yields and serve as the global safe haven in risk-off episodes.

## Security types

| Type | Maturity | Coupon | Auction frequency |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| T-bills | ≤ 1 year (4, 8, 13, 17, 26, 52 weeks) | Zero (discount) | Weekly |
| T-notes | 2-10 years (2, 3, 5, 7, 10) | Semi-annual | Monthly |
| T-bonds | 20-30 years | Semi-annual | Monthly |
| TIPS | 5, 10, 30 years | Real + inflation adjustment | Quarterly |
| FRNs | 2 years | Floating (T-bill + spread) | Monthly |

**T-bills** are sold at a discount and mature at par—the difference is your return. **Notes and bonds** pay coupons semi-annually.

## Market size

The Treasury market is ~$30 trillion—the deepest, most liquid bond market in the world.

**2025 issuance:** ~$29.7 trillion across 444 auctions. Quarterly borrowing estimates:
- Q3 2025: $1.007 trillion
- Q4 2025: $590 billion

## The yield curve

The relationship between yields at different maturities. The shape signals economic expectations.

### Shapes

| Shape | What it means | Economic signal |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Normal (upward)** | Long yields > short yields | Growth expected, stable economy |
| **Flat** | Similar yields across maturities | Uncertainty, transition |
| **Inverted** | Short yields > long yields | Recession warning |

**Why longer maturities usually pay more:** Investors demand compensation for locking up money longer and bearing more interest rate risk. Historically, 20-year bonds yield ~2% more than 3-month bills.

### Key spreads

| Spread | What it tracks |
| ------ | -------------- |
| **10Y-2Y (T10Y2Y)** | Most-watched recession indicator |
| **10Y-3M** | NY Fed's preferred recession model |
| **30Y-10Y** | Long-end steepness |

The 10Y-2Y spread inverted before the 2001, 2008, and 2020 recessions. It was negative from Oct 2022 to Dec 2024.

## Why Treasuries matter

**Risk-free rate:** All other assets are priced as a spread over Treasuries. When Treasury yields rise, discount rates rise, and asset valuations fall.

**Safe haven:** In [[Risk-on risk-off|risk-off]] episodes, capital flows to Treasuries, pushing yields down. Exception: [[Sell America trade]] when even Treasuries get sold.

**Fed policy transmission:** The Fed controls short-term rates directly (fed funds). Long-term Treasury yields reflect market expectations for future Fed policy plus term premium.

**Global reserve asset:** Foreign central banks and investors hold ~$8 trillion in Treasuries as reserve assets and dollar liquidity.

## Foreign holdings

Foreigners hold ~30% of outstanding Treasuries (~$9 trillion as of late 2025).

| Holder | Amount | Share |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| [[Japan]] | $1.2T | 12.4% |
| [[UK]] | ~$750B | 8.4% |
| [[China]] | $759B | 8.9% |

Foreign flows matter: net selling pressures yields higher regardless of Fed policy. This is a key [[Sell America trade]] dynamic.

## Auction dynamics

Treasury announces a tentative auction schedule quarterly (first Wednesday of Feb, May, Aug, Nov).

**Auction metrics to watch:**
- **Bid-to-cover ratio:** Demand indicator (higher = stronger)
- **Tail:** Difference between auction yield and when-issued yield (positive tail = weak demand)
- **Direct vs indirect bidders:** Indirect often proxies foreign central banks

Weak auctions (low bid-to-cover, large tail) can spike yields across the curve.

## Term premium

The extra yield investors demand for holding long-duration bonds beyond expected future short rates. When term premium rises, long yields rise even if Fed expectations are unchanged.

**Drivers:**
- Inflation uncertainty
- Fiscal deficit concerns
- Supply/demand imbalance
- Safe-haven status erosion

2025 saw elevated term premium on deficit fears and Moody's downgrade.
