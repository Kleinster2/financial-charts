## The trade

**SPXFP = S&P 500 Futures Excess Return Index**

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Tracks S&P 500 futures | Equity exposure |
| **Subtracts** short-term rate | Rate sensitivity |
| Omits dividends | Cleaner hedging |

**Result:** Performs best when stocks rise AND rates fall.

---

## Why it's popular

**Goldilocks bet:**
- Stocks up = equity gains
- Rates down = index boost (subtracting lower rate)
- Best outcome = both

**For issuers (banks):**
- Cleaner hedging (no dividend, rate variables)
- Lower manufacturing cost
- Can offer better terms to investors

**What SPXFP demand signals:**

| View | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| Rates falling | Fed continues cutting into 2027 |
| Stocks rising | Soft landing / no recession |
| Trump Fed pressure | More aggressive cuts possible |
| Goldilocks | Best of both worlds |

Buying SPXFP = betting on soft landing + dovish Fed.

## Risks

**Aaron Brachman (Steward Partners):**
> "I would guess that not everybody really understands the risks, and it is the reaching for yield that will harm them if interest rates move higher or if the market moves lower."

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Rates rise | Index underperforms (subtracting higher rate hurts) |
| Stocks fall | Equity losses (beyond buffer) |
| Both | Double whammy |
| Inflation sticky | Fed pauses/hikes, rates stay high |
| Valuations stretched | Equity downside risk |

**Brachman's firm:** "Pitched to us multiple times and we've said no every time."

## Banks issuing (Jan 2026)

At least 7 banks active:

## Context: Fed path

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Fed rate cuts | Ongoing, expected through 2027 |
| Trump/Powell | Pressure for more aggressive cuts |
| Job market | Resilient (slowing cut expectations) |
| Inflation | Above 2% target (risk to thesis) |

---

## Investment implications

**If you believe Goldilocks:**
- SPXFP notes = levered expression
- Upside participation + downside buffer

**If skeptical:**
- Complexity risk
- Rate reversal could hurt
- Equity valuations stretched
- "Reaching for yield" danger
