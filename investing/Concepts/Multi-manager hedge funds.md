**Multi-manager hedge funds** — Hedge fund structure where capital is allocated to dozens or hundreds of independent portfolio manager teams ("pods"). Also called "pod shops." Pioneered by [[Millennium]] (1989), now the dominant model among large hedge funds.

---

## Structure

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Pods** | Independent teams (10-350+ per fund) |
| **Autonomy** | Each pod runs own P&L, strategy, analyst team |
| **Risk limits** | Strict drawdown triggers (typically -5% to -10%) |
| **Capital allocation** | Dynamic — performers get more, losers get cut |
| **Pass-through fees** | Operating expenses charged directly to LPs |
| **PM economics** | Keep 15-20% of profits (vs traditional 20% fund-level) |

The central firm provides: capital, risk infrastructure, operations, compliance, technology. PMs provide: alpha generation.

---

## Why it works

**Diversification**: 300+ uncorrelated strategies in one fund = textbook portfolio theory. No single PM can blow up the fund.

**Talent identification**: Performance is immediately visible. Capital flows to winners, losers get cut quickly. Darwinian selection.

**Risk containment**: Strict drawdown limits prevent large losses. If a pod hits -5%, they're cut or terminated before it becomes -20%.

**Consistency**: [[Millennium]] has 1 losing year in 35. [[Citadel]] Wellington: 19% annualized since 1990. The model produces steady, high-Sharpe returns.

## Key players

| Firm | AUM | Pods | Founder | Notes |
|------|-----|------|---------|-------|
| [[Millennium]] | $79B | 300+ | [[Izzy Englander]] | Pioneer (1989), 2.5 Sharpe |
| [[Citadel]] | $65B+ | 350+ | [[Ken Griffin]] | Largest profits in HF history |
| [[Point72]] | $35B+ | 150+ | [[Steve Cohen]] | SAC successor |
| [[Balyasny]] | $21B+ | 100+ | Dmitry Balyasny | |
| [[Schonfeld]] | $15B+ | 80+ | | |
| [[ExodusPoint]] | $12B+ | | Michael Gelband (ex-Millennium) | |

## Fee structure

Traditional hedge fund: 2% management + 20% performance.

Pod shop: **Pass-through + incentive allocation.**

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Management fee | 0-2% |
| Performance fee | 20-30% |
| Pass-through expenses | 5-10%+ of AUM (salaries, tech, data, prime brokerage) |
| Effective fee | Can exceed 10% of AUM in high-expense years |

LPs accept this because returns (net of fees) still beat alternatives.

---

## Talent wars

Pod shops compete aggressively for top PMs:

| Tactic | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Guaranteed comp | Multi-year guarantees ($10-50M+) to poach PMs |
| Sign-on bonuses | $5-20M+ for proven performers |
| Higher payout | 18-22% vs 10-15% at traditional funds |
| Infrastructure | Best tech, data, risk systems |

This creates a flywheel: best talent → best returns → most capital → can pay more for talent.

The losers: traditional single-manager funds can't compete on comp. Boutiques struggle to launch.

## Convergence risk (2025)

In 2025, pod shop returns converged toward industry average:

| Year | Citadel | Millennium | Industry avg | Spread |
|------|---------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 2020 | +26% | +25% | +5% | +21pp |
| 2022 | +38% | +5% | -5% | +17pp |
| 2024 | +15% | +15% | +8% | +7pp |
| 2025 | +10% | +10.5% | +8% | **+2pp** |

**Possible causes:**
- Model commoditized (too many pod shops chasing same trades)
- Talent pool diluted across more platforms
- Trump H1 2025 volatility hurt market-neutral strategies
- Rising gross leverage = less alpha per dollar

**Open question:** One bad year, or structural commoditization?

See [[Hedge fund capital concentration]] for the capital flow dynamics.

## Criticisms

| Criticism | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Fee drag** | Pass-through + performance can exceed 10% of AUM |
| **Crowding** | 300+ pods across 6 firms = correlated positions |
| **Short squeeze risk** | Crowded shorts vulnerable to squeezes |
| **Commoditization** | Returns converging as model proliferates |
| **Talent mercenaries** | PMs chase highest guarantee, no loyalty |

---

## Who it displaced

The pod model absorbed capital from:

- **Single-manager funds** — Can't match comp, struggling to raise
- **Macro funds** — Discretionary macro underperformed for a decade
- **Long-biased** — Until 2025, when [[TCI]] broke Citadel's profit record

New fund launches contracted for 4 consecutive years (2021-2024) as capital concentrated into pod shops.
