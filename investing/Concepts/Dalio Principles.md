## Origin: The 1982 near-bankruptcy

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Year | 1981-82 |
| Prediction | US lent more to foreign countries than could be repaid; depression coming |
| What occurred | Mexico crisis happened (Aug 1982), but marked market trough |
| Fed response | Eased — 18-year bull market began |
| Dalio's outcome | "Dead wrong" — lost everything, borrowed $4K from father |

### Lessons that became Principles

| Lesson | What it became |
|--------|----------------|
| Fear of being wrong | "How do I know I'm right?" → Radical truth |
| Need for challenge | Built culture of challenging assumptions → Radical transparency |
| Diversification | Could reduce risk 80% without reducing returns → All Weather |
| Systematize | Codify decisions into algorithms → Believability-weighted |

**Dalio quote**: "In retrospect, my crash was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it gave me the humility I needed to balance my aggressiveness."

## Core principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Radical truth** | Pursue truth above all else — even when uncomfortable |
| **Radical transparency** | Share everything openly — all meetings recorded |
| **Believability-weighted** | Weight opinions by track record, not seniority |
| **Meritocracy of ideas** | Best idea wins, regardless of who proposes it |
| **Systematic thinking** | Codify decisions into algorithms where possible |

---

## Radical truth

The foundation of the system.

**What it means:**
- Pursue truth, not comfort
- Acknowledge reality, even when painful
- "Don't let loyalty stand in the way of truth"

**Implementation:**
- Direct, honest feedback expected at all times
- No sugarcoating bad news
- Challenge every assumption

---

## Radical transparency

**What it means:**
- Information should flow freely
- Hidden information creates bad decisions
- Everyone should see everything

**Implementation at Bridgewater:**

| Practice | How it works |
|----------|--------------|
| All meetings recorded | Anyone can review any meeting |
| Open access | Junior employees can see senior decisions |
| No back-channel | Discussions happen openly |
| Public feedback | Criticism given in front of others |

---

## Believability-weighted decisions

**The problem it solves:** Democratic voting treats all opinions equally. But some people have better track records than others.

**How it works:**
- Track everyone's accuracy over time
- Weight opinions by demonstrated competence
- Not one-person-one-vote, but weighted by believability
- Creates "meritocracy of ideas"

**Example:** A junior analyst who's been right 80% of the time on a topic gets more weight than a senior executive who's been right 50%.

## The Dot Collector

Bridgewater's proprietary tool for implementing believability-weighting.

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| Real-time ratings | Colleagues rate each other during meetings |
| Categories | Rated on specific traits (analytical, open-minded, etc.) |
| Public scores | Everyone can see everyone's ratings |
| Weighted voting | Decisions weighted by accumulated ratings |

**Controversy:** Some employees find it stressful, surveillance-like. Others say it creates true meritocracy.

---

## Systematic/algorithmic thinking

**The principle:** Decisions that can be systematized should be.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Codify rules | Write down decision criteria |
| Back-test | Test rules against historical data |
| Algorithm-assisted | Use systems to flag when rules apply |
| Human override | Humans can override, but must explain why |

**Application:** Bridgewater's investment process is highly systematized — models flag opportunities, humans validate.

| **Surveillance** | Transparency is the point — no hidden agendas |
