# AI-Native Enterprise Learning

The corporate learning & development (L&D) market is shifting from static LMS platforms to AI-native experiences — personalized, interactive, generated on-the-fly rather than pre-recorded and broadcast.

## The shift

**Legacy model (LMS era):** Upload SCORM packages, track completion rates, one-size-fits-all video courses. Dominated by [[Cornerstone OnDemand]], Docebo, SAP SuccessFactors.

**AI-native model:** Two distinct value propositions emerging:

1. **Knowledge access** — AI avatars as the interface to internal knowledge bases. Instead of searching wikis, intranets, and Confluence pages, employees interact with an avatar that can surface and explain company-specific information conversationally. The avatar becomes the enterprise search layer.

2. **Upskilling** — Interactive, personalized training. AI avatars deliver content in any language, AI tutors answer questions mid-lesson, role-play simulations test comprehension. Video becomes conversational rather than broadcast.

[[Synthesia]] is pursuing both: Riparbelli (FT, Feb 2026) frames it as the "$100B question" — what does video look like when it's truly AI-native? The answer isn't just better training videos, it's a new interface for how employees interact with enterprise knowledge entirely.

## Market size

- Global LXP market: ~$3.7B (2025), projected $32B by 2032 (17% CAGR)
- Corporate e-learning overall: ~$400B by 2030
- Managed Learning Services: projected $8.9B by 2033

## Key dynamics

**Cost collapse** — AI-generated training video costs approach zero vs. $5-50K per traditional corporate video. Time-to-produce drops from weeks to minutes. This doesn't just replace existing content — it enables content that was never economically viable (hyper-specific role training, real-time policy updates, per-employee onboarding).

**Knowledge access as the wedge** — Enterprises sit on massive internal knowledge (wikis, SOPs, policies, product docs) that employees can't find. AI avatars become the conversational interface to that corpus — combining RAG with a human-like delivery layer. This is a different market than L&D: it competes with enterprise search (Glean, Guru) and internal chatbots.

**Personalization at scale** — Same training, different versions: language, pace, examples, difficulty. AI tutor layer means the learner can pause and ask questions, something impossible with pre-recorded video.

**Compliance & regulated industries** — Healthcare, finance, and manufacturing have mandatory training cycles. AI-native platforms can generate audit trails, adapt to regulatory changes automatically, and role-play scenarios (customer complaints, safety incidents).

**The incumbents' dilemma** — Legacy LMS vendors (Cornerstone, Docebo, Workday Learning) have distribution but lack generative AI capabilities. AI-native entrants have the tech but need enterprise trust and compliance certifications. Meanwhile, enterprise search players ([[Glean]], Guru) lack the video/avatar layer.

## Players

| Company | Approach | Stage |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Synthesia]] | AI avatar video + interactive tutors | $4B val, $150M ARR, 60K customers |
| [[HeyGen]] | AI avatar video, translation/dubbing | $500M val (2024) |
| Descript | AI video editing + transcription | $553M raised |
| Docebo | Traditional LMS adding AI features | Public (DCBO) |
| Cornerstone OnDemand | Legacy LMS, acquired by Clearlake | Private |
| Udemy Business | Marketplace model for enterprise | Public (UDMY) |

## Investment angle

The bet is that **AI-native platforms eat LMS from below** — starting with L&D teams that need multilingual training at scale (Synthesia's 60% Fortune 100 penetration), then expanding into interactive/personalized formats that legacy platforms can't match.

Risk: incumbents bolt on AI features fast enough to retain enterprise contracts. LMS switching costs are high (deep HR system integrations, compliance audit trails).
