## Components

| Ticker | Name | Why it's in the AI trade |
|--------|------|-------------------------|
| NVDA | NVIDIA | GPU monopoly, AI training/inference |
| ORCL | Oracle | Cloud AI infrastructure, data centers |
| GOOGL | Alphabet | AI capex, cloud, models |
| CRWV | CoreWeave | Neocloud, GPU-as-a-service |
| (other neoclouds) | Lambda, etc. | Same thesis as CoreWeave |

## What's NOT in the AI trade

| Ticker | Name | Why excluded |
|--------|------|-------------|
| MSFT | [[Microsoft]] | Too diversified — Office, Windows, gaming dilute AI exposure |
| AMZN | [[Amazon]] | Too diversified — retail, logistics dilute AI exposure |
| AAPL | [[Apple]] | [[Consumer]] hardware, not AI infrastructure play |

These have AI exposure but aren't clean proxies for "AI is big" thesis.
