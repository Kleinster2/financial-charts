**Consumer AI** — AI products for end users (not enterprise). ChatGPT, AI assistants, wearables, creative tools. High volume, lower margins than enterprise.

## Why consumer AI matters

| Metric | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Volume | Billions of potential users |
| Data | Training signal from usage |
| Distribution | Winner-take-most dynamics |
| Brand | Mindshare matters |

## Key consumer AI products

| Product | Company | Users |

## Consumer vs Enterprise AI

| Aspect | Consumer | Enterprise |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Revenue model | Freemium, subscriptions | Contracts, API |
| Margins | Lower | Higher |
| Volume | High | Lower |
| Churn | Higher | Lower |
| Examples | ChatGPT, wearables | Claude API, Copilot for Business |

**Enterprise more profitable:** [[Anthropic]] is 80% enterprise for a reason.

## Monetization challenges

**Hard to charge consumers:**
- Free alternatives abundant
- Willingness to pay limited
- Ads may be necessary
- China especially resistant to paying

---

## Wearables as distribution

**AI moving to body:**
- Smart glasses (Meta Ray-Ban)
- Smart rings
- Always-on assistants
- Context-aware AI

See [[Wearable AI]] for deep dive.

## China consumer AI

| Product | Company | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Quark | [[Alibaba]] | 150M MAU |
| Doubao | [[ByteDance]] | TikTok-integrated |
| Kimi | Moonshot | Popular chatbot |
| [[Liangzhu]] apps | Indie devs | Lifestyle AI |

China = high volume, low willingness to pay.

## Investment angle

| Approach | Vehicles |
|----------|----------|
| Platform winners | GOOGL, META, MSFT |
| Pure-play | AAPL (if AI succeeds) |
| Picks & shovels | NVDA (GPUs for training) |
| Private | OpenAI, Anthropic |

**Caveat:** Consumer AI may not be profitable — enterprise may be better bet.
