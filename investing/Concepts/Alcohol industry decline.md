# Alcohol industry decline

Global beer, wine, and spirits stocks have shed **$830B in market value** since June 2021 — a 46% drop across ~50 major producers tracked by Bloomberg. The decline reflects converging secular and cyclical forces, with Gen Z's reduced drinking as the most visible cultural shift.

*@stats_feed, Feb 2026. The $830B figure is market cap decline (Bloomberg), not revenue loss.*

## The forces

### 1. Gen Z sobriety (secular)
Gen Z drinks significantly less than prior generations at the same age. Drivers:
- **"Sober curious" / wellness culture** — health consciousness, fitness, mental health awareness
- **Social media** — nobody wants to be filmed drunk. Instagram/TikTok culture favors control
- **Cannabis substitution** — legal in many US states, preferred by some younger consumers
- **Information access** — Gen Z grew up with health data on alcohol harm readily available

### 2. GLP-1 drugs (secular)
Ozempic, Wegovy, and other GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce alcohol cravings as a side effect. Early studies show 30-50% reduction in alcohol consumption among users. With 15M+ Americans on GLP-1s and growing, this is a structural headwind for alcohol volumes that the industry didn't see coming.

### 3. Post-Covid normalization (cyclical)
June 2021 was peak pandemic revenge spending — alcohol stocks were at inflated valuations alongside all consumer staples. The decline partly reflects mean reversion from an unsustainable high.

### 4. Rising rates / multiple compression (cyclical)
Higher interest rates crushed consumer staples valuations broadly (2022-2024). Alcohol stocks traded at premium multiples pre-2022; those compressed as risk-free rates rose.

### 5. China demand slowdown (cyclical/secular)
Same dynamic as [[China luxury boom and bust]] — Chinese consumer spending weakened as property crisis destroyed household wealth. Affects premium spirits and wine brands especially.

### 6. Input cost inflation (cyclical)
Grain, glass, aluminum, logistics costs all spiked 2022-2023, squeezing margins before companies could fully pass through pricing.

## Key data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Market cap loss | $830B (Jun 2021 → late 2025) | Bloomberg |
| Decline from peak | -46% | Bloomberg |
| Jim Beam | Halting some production (2026) | Forbes |
| Gen Z drinking less | Multiple surveys confirm | Various |
| GLP-1 users (US) | 15M+ and growing | IQVIA |

## Affected companies

Major producers in the Bloomberg index include:
- [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] (BUD) — world's largest brewer
- [[Diageo]] (DEO) — Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Smirnoff
- [[Pernod Ricard]] — Absolut, Jameson
- [[Constellation Brands]] (STZ) — Corona, Modelo
- [[Rémy Cointreau]] — cognac
- [[Beam Suntory]] — Jim Beam, Maker's Mark (halting production 2026)

## Investment implications

**Bear case (structural decline):**
- Gen Z sobriety + GLP-1s are permanent demand destroyers, not cyclical
- Alcohol is the next tobacco — cultural stigma building, regulation tightening
- Cannabis legalization provides direct substitute
- Premium/craft may hold up but volume decline is secular

**Bull case (oversold, cyclical recovery):**
- $830B decline is mostly multiple compression, not revenue collapse — companies still profitable
- Emerging market growth (India, Africa) offsets developed market decline
- Premiumization trend — people drink less but spend more per drink
- M&A consolidation opportunities at depressed valuations
- "Sober curious" could plateau — every generation rebels against the previous one

**Template:** Like [[Diamond market collapse]], this is a story of converging forces hitting an industry that assumed demand was permanent. Unlike diamonds, alcohol companies have real cash flows and pricing power — the question is whether the volume decline is cyclical or structural.
