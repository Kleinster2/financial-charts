## Supply dynamics

**Structural tightness:**
- Average mine-to-production lead time: **17 years** ([[IEA]])
- 2026 mine production: +2.3% to 23.86M MT
- 2026 refined production: +0.9% to 28.58M MT
- 2026 refined consumption: +2.1% to 28.73M MT
- Result: **150K MT deficit** by year-end

**Recent disruptions:**
- Grasberg (Indonesia) mudslide — force majeure, closed until Q2 2026
- Quebrada Blanca ([[Chile]]) — guidance downgrade

## Demand drivers

| Driver | Share of growth |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Grid/power infrastructure** | >60% of growth to 2030 |
| **EVs and batteries** | Significant |
| **AI/data centers** | Growing |
| **Construction** | Mature, China slowing |

Grid buildout for electrification is the dominant growth driver.

## Key relationships

| Factor | Impact on copper |
|--------|------------------|
| **China demand** | 50% of global consumption |
| **[[US dollar]]** | Strong USD = lower prices |
| **Global growth** | Cyclically sensitive |
| **Green capex** | Structural tailwind |
| **Mine supply** | Constrained, long lead times |

## US tariff risk

Commerce Department recommendation on copper tariffs expected by **June 2026**. Goldman base case: 25%+ refined copper tariff shortly after.

Impact: Accelerated US stockpiling ahead of tariffs, potential price divergence between US and global markets.
