**Copper** — Industrial metal critical to electrification, construction, and manufacturing. Called "Dr. Copper" for its economic sensitivity — demand tracks global activity, so rising copper signals expansion, falling copper warns of recession. Primary vehicle: CPER (United States Copper Index Fund).

**2026 distinction:** Current rally driven more by AI infrastructure + supply constraints than traditional macro signaling.

## Current status (Jan 29, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LME copper | **$13,900/t** (hit $14,500 intraday) |
| Daily move | **+6.1%** (biggest in 16+ years) |
| 2026 forecast range | $9,800-$12,500/t (now exceeded) |
| Market balance | ~330K MT deficit expected |
| YTD performance | ~+40% |
| COMEX inventories | **500K+ tons** (record high) |
| LME inventories | Highest since May 2025 |

**Jan 29 rally drivers:** Chinese speculative frenzy (record SHFE volumes), USD at 4-year lows, AI/data center demand narrative. But inventories at record highs contradict scarcity story — StoneX: "fundamentals certainly do not support copper at current levels."

## Price forecasts (2026)

| Bank | 2026 avg forecast |
|------|-------------------|
| J.P. Morgan | $12,075/t (Q2 peak $12,500) |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | <$11,000/t (surplus view) |
| BMI/Fitch | $11,000/t |
| [[Bank of America]] | $11,313/t |

Wide dispersion reflects uncertainty on tariffs and China demand.

## Supply dynamics

**Structural tightness:**
- Average mine-to-production lead time: **17 years** ([[IEA]])
- 2026 mine production: +2.3% to 23.86M MT
- 2026 refined production: +0.9% to 28.58M MT
- 2026 refined consumption: +2.1% to 28.73M MT
- Result: **150K MT deficit** by year-end

**Recent disruptions:**
- Grasberg (Indonesia) mudslide — force majeure, closed until Q2 2026
- Quebrada Blanca ([[Chile]]) — guidance downgrade

## Demand drivers

| Driver | Share of growth |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Grid/power infrastructure** | >60% of growth to 2030 |
| **EVs and batteries** | Significant |
| **AI/data centers** | **475K tons in 2026** (up from 110K in 2025) |
| **Construction** | Mature, China slowing |

Grid buildout for electrification is the dominant growth driver. [[JPMorgan]]'s Shearer: Data centers create "inelastic demand" — developers buy regardless of price.

**EV copper intensity:**

| Vehicle type | Copper |
|--------------|--------|
| ICE car | ~23 kg (~50 lbs) |
| Hybrid | ~39 kg (~85 lbs) |
| BEV | **82+ kg (180+ lbs)** |

**Data center intensity:** Single hyperscale DC requires 20,000-40,000 tonnes copper.

## Key relationships

| Factor | Impact on copper |
|--------|------------------|
| **China demand** | 50% of global consumption |
| **[[US dollar]]** | Strong USD = lower prices |
| **Global growth** | Cyclically sensitive |
| **Green capex** | Structural tailwind |
| **Mine supply** | Constrained, long lead times |

## US tariff risk

Commerce Department recommendation on copper tariffs expected by **June 2026**. Goldman base case: 25%+ refined copper tariff shortly after.

Impact: Accelerated US stockpiling ahead of tariffs, potential price divergence between US and global markets.
