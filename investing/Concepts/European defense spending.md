## Structural changes

| Shift | Implication |
|-------|-------------|

| **Joint procurement** | EU coordination improving |

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Multi-year spending cycle (not one-time)
- Order backlogs provide visibility
- Ammunition shortfall = years of catch-up
- Rheinmetall = "European defense consolidator"
- Trump pressure keeps spending elevated

**Bear:**
- Already priced in? (400% runs)
- Peace could reduce urgency
- Execution on production ramp uncertain
- European fragmentation
