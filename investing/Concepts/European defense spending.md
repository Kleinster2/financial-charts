**European defense spending** — Ukraine war triggered historic military spending increase. NATO 2% target now floor, not ceiling.

## Overview

| Metric | 2021 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| EU defense spending | €214B | €280B+ | +30% |
| NATO Europe % GDP | 1.6% | 2.1% | +50bps |
| Countries at 2% | 6 | 23 | +17 |

**Trigger:** Russia's Ukraine invasion (Feb 2022) shattered post-Cold War assumptions.

## Germany: Zeitenwende → Schuldenbremse

"Zeitenwende" (turning point) — Chancellor Scholz's Feb 2022 speech. Followed by [[Schuldenbremse reform]] in 2025 under Merz — constitutional change enabling unlimited defense borrowing.

| Initiative | Amount | Year |
|------------|--------|------|
| Special fund | €100B one-time | 2022 |
| Annual budget | €52B → €72B target | 2022 |
| **Defense exemption** | **Unlimited** (above 1% GDP) | 2025 |
| F-35 purchase | 35 aircraft | 2022 |

**2025 shift:** Schuldenbremse reform exempts all defense spending above 1% GDP from constitutional debt limits — effectively no ceiling on German military spending.

**Beneficiaries:** [[Rheinmetall]], Hensoldt, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.

| **Air defense** | IRIS-T, Patriot | Diehl, [[RTX]] |
| **Artillery** | 155mm shells | Rheinmetall, Nexter |
| **Naval** | Frigates, subs | Thales, Naval Group |

## European defense stocks

| Company | Country | Focus | Performance |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [[Rheinmetall]] | Germany | Armor, ammo | **+400%** since 2022 |
| Thales | France | Electronics, missiles | +150% |

| Saab | Sweden | Gripen, subs | +200% |
| Hensoldt | Germany | Sensors, radar | +150% |
| Dassault | France | Rafale jets | +60% |

## Ammunition crisis

NATO discovered it had ~2 weeks of ammunition for a conventional war.

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 155mm shell production | 2M/year target (was 300K) |
| Wait times | 2-3 years for orders |
| Rheinmetall | Building 5 new ammo plants |
| EU initiative | €2B joint procurement |

---

## Structural changes

| Shift | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **2% floor, not ceiling** | Spending to stay elevated |
| **Ukraine industrial demand** | Long-term order books |
| **European production** | Reduce US dependence |
| **Joint procurement** | EU coordination improving |
| **Trump factor** | US pressure for burden-sharing |

## 2025-2026 escalation

**NATO target upgrade (Jun 2025):** 2% → **5% of GDP by 2035.** This transforms the spending profile from catch-up to structural expansion.

| Development | Value | Date |
|-------------|-------|------|
| **NATO target** | **5% GDP** by 2035 | Jun 2025 |
| STOXX Aerospace & Defense | **+65%** in 2025 | Dec 2025 |
| **DTCP "Project Liberty"** | **€500M** — Europe's largest defense VC fund | Jan 2026 |
| **EU EDF 2026** | **€1B** for defense R&D | 2026 budget |
| [[Helsing]] valuation | **€12B** — Europe's most valuable defense startup | Jun 2025 |
| Germany Uranos KI | AI targeting system, deploy 2026 | Jan 2026 |

**Kubilius estimate (EU defense commissioner):** EU would need **3M drones/year** just to hold Lithuania in wider Russia war. Current capacity is a fraction of this.

**2026 theme:** Defense tech startups must prove they can scale manufacturing. Rheinmetall, BAE may acquire VC-backed defense tech to accelerate.

**Pistorius (German DefMin):** €35B for space security 2026-2030.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Multi-year spending cycle (not one-time)
- Order backlogs provide visibility
- Ammunition shortfall = years of catch-up
- Rheinmetall = "European defense consolidator"
- Trump pressure keeps spending elevated

**Bear:**
- Already priced in? (400% runs)
- Peace could reduce urgency
- Execution on production ramp uncertain
- European fragmentation
