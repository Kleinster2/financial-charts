**European defense spending** — Ukraine war triggered historic military spending increase. NATO 2% target now floor, not ceiling.

---

## Overview

| Metric | 2021 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| [[EU]] defense spending | €214B | €280B+ | +30% |
| NATO Europe % GDP | 1.6% | 2.1% | +50bps |
| Countries at 2% | 6 | 23 | +17 |

**Trigger:** [[Russia]]'s Ukraine invasion (Feb 2022) shattered post-Cold War assumptions.

## Germany: Zeitenwende → Schuldenbremse

"Zeitenwende" (turning point) — Chancellor Scholz's Feb 2022 speech. Followed by [[Schuldenbremse reform]] in 2025 under Merz — constitutional change enabling unlimited defense borrowing.

| Initiative | Amount | Year |
|------------|--------|------|
| Special fund | €100B one-time | 2022 |
| Annual budget | €52B → €72B target | 2022 |
| **Defense exemption** | **Unlimited** (above 1% GDP) | 2025 |
| F-35 purchase | 35 aircraft | 2022 |

**2025 shift:** Schuldenbremse reform exempts all defense spending above 1% GDP from constitutional debt limits — effectively no ceiling on German military spending.

**Beneficiaries:** [[Rheinmetall]], Hensoldt, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.

## Country breakdown

| Country | 2025 % GDP | Key programs |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Poland** | 4.0%+ | Largest [[EU]] spender (% GDP) |
| **[[UK]]** | 2.3% | Nuclear, carriers |
| **Germany** | 2.1% | Zeitenwende catch-up |
| **[[France]]** | 2.1% | Nuclear, Rafale |
| **Italy** | 1.6% | Naval, [[Leonardo]] |
| **Spain** | 1.3% | Behind target |

## Key spending areas

| Area | Priority | Beneficiaries |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Ammunition** | Critical shortage | [[Rheinmetall]], Nammo |
| **Armor** | Tank modernization | Rheinmetall (Leopard), KNDS |
| **Air defense** | IRIS-T, Patriot | Diehl, [[RTX]] |
| **Artillery** | 155mm shells | Rheinmetall, Nexter |
| **Naval** | Frigates, subs | [[Thales]], Naval Group |

## European defense stocks

| Company | Country | Focus | Performance |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [[Rheinmetall]] | Germany | Armor, ammo | **+400%** since 2022 |
| [[Thales]] | [[France]] | Electronics, missiles | +150% |
| [[Leonardo]] | Italy | [[Aerospace]], naval | +100% |
| [[BAE Systems]] | [[UK]] | Full spectrum | +80% |
| [[Saab]] | Sweden | Gripen, subs | +200% |
| Hensoldt | Germany | [[Sensors]], radar | +150% |
| Dassault | [[France]] | Rafale jets | +60% |

## Ammunition crisis

NATO discovered it had ~2 weeks of ammunition for a conventional war.

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 155mm shell production | 2M/year target (was 300K) |
| Wait times | 2-3 years for orders |
| Rheinmetall | Building 5 new ammo plants |
| [[EU]] initiative | €2B joint procurement |

---

## Structural changes

| Shift | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **2% floor, not ceiling** | Spending to stay elevated |
| **Ukraine industrial demand** | Long-term order books |
| **European production** | Reduce US dependence |
| **Joint procurement** | [[EU]] coordination improving |
| **Trump factor** | US pressure for burden-sharing |

---

## 2025-2026 escalation

**NATO target upgrade (Jun 2025):** 2% → **5% of GDP by 2035.** This transforms the spending profile from catch-up to structural expansion.

| Development | Value | Date |
|-------------|-------|------|
| **NATO target** | **5% GDP** by 2035 | Jun 2025 |
| STOXX [[Aerospace]] & Defense | **+65%** in 2025 | Dec 2025 |
| **DTCP "Project Liberty"** | **€500M** — Europe's largest defense VC fund | Jan 2026 |
| **[[EU]] [[EDF]] 2026** | **€1B** for defense R&D | 2026 budget |
| [[Helsing]] valuation | **€12B** — Europe's most valuable defense startup | Jun 2025 |
| Germany Uranos KI | AI targeting system, deploy 2026 | Jan 2026 |

**Kubilius estimate ([[EU]] defense commissioner):** [[EU]] would need **[[3M]] drones/year** just to hold Lithuania in wider [[Russia]] war. Current capacity is a fraction of this.

**2026 theme:** Defense tech startups must prove they can scale manufacturing. Rheinmetall, BAE may acquire VC-backed defense tech to accelerate.

**Pistorius (German DefMin):** €35B for space security 2026-2030.

## Structural imbalance (Feb 2026)

[[Germany]]'s Bundeswehr budget could reach **$189B by 2029** — dwarfing every other European country. Merz has openly stated he wants Germany as Europe's **leading military power**, unprecedented for a postwar chancellor.

| Country | Projected defense budget | Constraint |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Germany** | $189B by 2029 | None (Schuldenbremse reform) |
| **France** | Cannot match | Debt/GDP pressure |
| **Italy** | Cannot match | ~140% debt/GDP |
| **Spain** | Cannot match | Low interest in spending |

**The debt trap:** France, Italy, and Spain can only match German spending through EU common debt issuance. But the EU SAFE lending package (~EUR 160B) is smaller than Germany's projected national budget alone. And who decides on common debt? Germany.

**[[Poland]] hedging:** 4-5% of GDP on defense — driven not just by Russia threat but by distrust of Germany's reliability as a security partner. Poland doesn't believe the Bundeswehr will show up.

**Merz-Meloni axis:** Germany and [[Italy]] positioning as manufacturing/defense partners. [[Leonardo]] as potential collaboration partner for [[Rheinmetall]]/[[Airbus]], partly because [[Dassault Aviation]] is being uncooperative on FCAS technology sharing with Airbus.

**European army logic:** Combined European spending already ~2x Russia's. A single force could have full-spectrum capability (nuclear, space, cyber, naval). No national budget — not even Germany at $189B — can achieve this alone. Historical precedent: the 1950s European Defense Community (joint Franco-German army) was rejected by French parliament in 1954; NATO membership was the fallback. The question of a common European force is back on the horizon.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Multi-year spending cycle (not one-time)
- Order backlogs provide visibility
- Ammunition shortfall = years of catch-up
- Rheinmetall = "European defense consolidator"
- Trump pressure keeps spending elevated

**Bear:**
- Already priced in? (400% runs)
- Peace could reduce urgency
- Execution on production ramp uncertain
- European fragmentation
