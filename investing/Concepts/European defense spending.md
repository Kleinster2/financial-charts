**European defense spending** — Ukraine war triggered historic military spending increase. NATO 2% target now floor, not ceiling.

## Overview

| Metric | 2021 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| [[EU]] defense spending | €214B | €280B+ | +30% |
| NATO Europe % GDP | 1.6% | 2.1% | +50bps |
| Countries at 2% | 6 | 23 | +17 |

**Trigger:** [[Russia]]'s Ukraine invasion (Feb 2022) shattered post-Cold War assumptions.

## Germany: Zeitenwende → Schuldenbremse

"Zeitenwende" (turning point) — Chancellor Scholz's Feb 2022 speech. Followed by [[Schuldenbremse reform]] in 2025 under Merz — constitutional change enabling unlimited defense borrowing.

| Initiative | Amount | Year |
|------------|--------|------|
| Special fund | €100B one-time | 2022 |
| Annual budget | €52B → €72B target | 2022 |
| **Defense exemption** | **Unlimited** (above 1% GDP) | 2025 |
| F-35 purchase | 35 aircraft | 2022 |

**2025 shift:** Schuldenbremse reform exempts all defense spending above 1% GDP from constitutional debt limits — effectively no ceiling on German military spending.

**Beneficiaries:** [[Rheinmetall]], Hensoldt, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.

## Country breakdown

| Country | 2025 % GDP | Key programs |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Poland** | 4.0%+ | Largest [[EU]] spender (% GDP) |
| **[[UK]]** | 2.3% | Nuclear, carriers |
| **Germany** | 2.1% | Zeitenwende catch-up |
| **[[France]]** | 2.1% | Nuclear, Rafale |
| **Italy** | 1.6% | Naval, [[Leonardo]] |
| **Spain** | 1.3% | Behind target |

## Key spending areas

| Area | Priority | Beneficiaries |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Ammunition** | Critical shortage | [[Rheinmetall]], Nammo |
| **Armor** | Tank modernization | Rheinmetall (Leopard), KNDS |
| **Air defense** | IRIS-T, Patriot | Diehl, [[RTX]] |
| **Artillery** | 155mm shells | Rheinmetall, Nexter |
| **Naval** | Frigates, subs | [[Thales]], Naval Group |

## European defense stocks

| Company | Country | Focus | Performance |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [[Rheinmetall]] | Germany | Armor, ammo | **+400%** since 2022 |
| [[Thales]] | [[France]] | Electronics, missiles | +150% |
| [[Leonardo]] | Italy | [[Aerospace]], naval | +100% |
| [[BAE Systems]] | [[UK]] | Full spectrum | +80% |
| [[Saab]] | Sweden | Gripen, subs | +200% |
| Hensoldt | Germany | [[Sensors]], radar | +150% |
| Dassault | [[France]] | Rafale jets | +60% |

## Ammunition crisis

NATO discovered it had ~2 weeks of ammunition for a conventional war.

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 155mm shell production | 2M/year target (was 300K) |
| Wait times | 2-3 years for orders |
| Rheinmetall | Building 5 new ammo plants |
| [[EU]] initiative | €2B joint procurement |

---

## Structural changes

| Shift | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **2% floor, not ceiling** | Spending to stay elevated |
| **Ukraine industrial demand** | Long-term order books |
| **European production** | Reduce US dependence |
| **Joint procurement** | [[EU]] coordination improving |
| **Trump factor** | US pressure for burden-sharing |

## 2025-2026 escalation

**NATO target upgrade (Jun 2025):** 2% → **5% of GDP by 2035.** This transforms the spending profile from catch-up to structural expansion.

| Development | Value | Date |
|-------------|-------|------|
| **NATO target** | **5% GDP** by 2035 | Jun 2025 |
| STOXX [[Aerospace]] & Defense | **+65%** in 2025 | Dec 2025 |
| **DTCP "Project Liberty"** | **€500M** — Europe's largest defense VC fund | Jan 2026 |
| **[[EU]] [[EDF]] 2026** | **€1B** for defense R&D | 2026 budget |
| [[Helsing]] valuation | **€12B** — Europe's most valuable defense startup | Jun 2025 |
| Germany Uranos KI | AI targeting system, deploy 2026 | Jan 2026 |

**Kubilius estimate ([[EU]] defense commissioner):** [[EU]] would need **[[3M]] drones/year** just to hold Lithuania in wider [[Russia]] war. Current capacity is a fraction of this.

**2026 theme:** Defense tech startups must prove they can scale manufacturing. Rheinmetall, BAE may acquire VC-backed defense tech to accelerate.

**Pistorius (German DefMin):** €35B for space security 2026-2030.

## Structural imbalance (Feb 2026)

[[Germany]]'s defense budget set to reach **€162B ($191B) by 2029** — dwarfing every other European country. [[Friedrich Merz]] has openly stated he wants Germany as Europe's **leading military power**, unprecedented for a postwar chancellor. Berlin recently criticized [[France]] for not spending enough on weapons — a barb that ignores Germany's decades of underspending and free-riding under the Western nuclear umbrella.

| Country | Projected defense budget | Constraint |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Germany** | €162B ($191B) by 2029 | None (Schuldenbremse reform) |
| **France** | Cannot match | Debt/GDP pressure |
| **Italy** | Cannot match | ~140% debt/GDP |
| **Spain** | Cannot match | Low interest in spending |

**NATO Europe aggregate target:** €831B/year by 2035 — but a purely national approach sacrifices scale, interoperability, and capability.

**The debt trap:** France, Italy, and Spain can only match German spending through EU common debt issuance. But the EU SAFE lending package (~EUR 160B) is smaller than Germany's projected national budget alone. And who decides on common debt? Germany. Merz opposes joint European borrowing, which Macron sees as the path to European self-reliance.

**Bundesbank shift:** Even Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel — hardly a monetary dove — has made the case for mutual European defense debt. Notable given German institutional resistance to debt mutualization since the euro crisis.

**"Involuntary hegemony":** Liana Fix (Council on Foreign Relations) describes Germany's combined accumulation of economic and military power as "involuntary hegemony" — a concentration that European partners may want to constrain. The dynamic echoes euro crisis fights, now transposed to NATO precincts.

**[[Poland]] hedging:** 4-5% of GDP on defense — driven not just by Russia threat but by distrust of Germany's reliability as a security partner. Poland doesn't believe the Bundeswehr will show up.

**Merz-Meloni axis:** Germany and [[Italy]] positioning as manufacturing/defense partners. [[Leonardo]] as potential collaboration partner for [[Rheinmetall]]/[[Airbus]], partly because [[Dassault Aviation]] is being uncooperative on [[FCAS]] technology sharing with Airbus.

**Germany First risk:** Berlin eyeing its own fighter jet program (beyond [[FCAS]]) and its own satellite constellation, plus preference for German arms manufacturers — risks turning the "European defense union" into national procurement. Former [[Airbus]] CEO Tom Enders dismissed a domestic German fighter as "national hubris." A solo satellite network cannot compete with [[Starlink]].

**European army logic:** Combined European spending already ~2x Russia's. A single force could have full-spectrum capability (nuclear, space, cyber, naval). No national budget — not even Germany at €162B — can achieve this alone. Historical precedent: the 1950s European Defense Community (joint Franco-German army) was rejected by French parliament in 1954; NATO membership was the fallback. The question of a common European force is back on the horizon.

**Grand bargain proposal:** French willingness to share its nuclear deterrent with Germany in return for German willingness to contemplate joint defense financing. Poll (Internationale Politik): 73% of Europeans believe the continent must ensure its own defense.

## Investment thesis

**Bull:**
- Multi-year spending cycle (not one-time)
- Order backlogs provide visibility
- Ammunition shortfall = years of catch-up
- Rheinmetall = "European defense consolidator"
- Trump pressure keeps spending elevated

**Bear:**
- Already priced in? (400% runs)
- Peace could reduce urgency
- Execution on production ramp uncertain
- European fragmentation
