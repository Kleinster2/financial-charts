~90% of advanced semiconductor production is concentrated in [[Taiwan]], mostly at [[TSMC]]. This represents one of the largest single points of failure in the global economy.

> **Key insight:** [[Taiwan]] risk is priced as an externality, not an execution flaw. Geographic diversification benefits customers more than foundries. The tail risk may be underpriced.

## The concentration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Taiwan]] share of advanced logic (<7nm) | ~90% |
| TSMC share of [[Taiwan]] production | ~85% |
| TSMC share of global advanced logic | ~75-80% |
| Distance from mainland [[China]] | ~100 miles |

**What "advanced" means:** The chips that power AI, smartphones, data centers, military systems.

## Why it matters

**Scenarios that would halt global chip supply:**

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [[China]] invasion | Low but non-zero | Catastrophic |
| Blockade | Higher than invasion | Severe |
| Infrastructure attack | Medium | Severe |
| Major earthquake | Low-medium | Moderate-severe |
| Power grid failure | Has happened | Moderate |
| Pandemic/logistics | Proven possible | Moderate |

**Who depends on [[Taiwan]]:**

| Customer | [[Taiwan]] exposure |
|----------|-----------------|
| [[Apple]] | ~100% of iPhone chips |
| [[NVIDIA]] | ~100% of GPUs |
| [[AMD]] | ~100% of CPUs/GPUs |
| [[Qualcomm]] | ~90%+ of mobile chips |
| US military | Critical systems |

## Mitigation attempts

**Geographic diversification efforts:**

| Project | Capacity | Timeline | Limitation |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] | ~5% of TSMC | 2025-28 | 1-2 nodes behind [[Taiwan]] |
| [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] | New 2nm capacity | 2026+ | Execution uncertain |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Domestic option | 2025+ | Unproven at leading edge |
| [[Japan]] fabs (TSMC, [[Sony]]) | Specialty | 2024-25 | Mature nodes only |

**The math problem:**
- TSMC [[Taiwan]]: ~15M wafer starts/year (advanced)
- TSMC Arizona (all 3 phases): ~1M wafer starts/year
- [[Gap]]: Still 90%+ in [[Taiwan]] for years

---

## The "insurance" problem

Arizona fabs are framed as "insurance" but:

| [[Insurance]] assumption | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Insured asset survives | [[Taiwan]] fabs would be destroyed/inaccessible |
| Replacement possible | Arizona = 5-10% of capacity |
| Premium is acceptable | $40B+ capex for partial coverage |
| Claim is straightforward | Geopolitical chaos, allocation fights |

**The uncomfortable truth:**
- A real [[Taiwan]] contingency would be existential for TSMC's current form
- Arizona provides *continuity for some customers*, not replacement
- The "insurance" narrative may overstate protection

---

## [[China]]'s calculus

**Why [[China]] might not invade:**
- Economic interdependence ([[China]] needs TSMC too)
- Military cost and uncertainty
- Global economic retaliation
- Fabs would be destroyed/unusable in conflict

**Why the risk is non-zero:**
- Xi has stated reunification goal
- 2027-2030 often cited as risk window
- Blockade is less destructive than invasion
- Accidents and miscalculation possible

---

## How markets price this

| Approach | Current state |
|----------|---------------|
| TSMC valuation | ~15-20x P/E (discount to peers) |
| Customer behavior | Diversification efforts underway |
| [[Insurance]] markets | Political risk insurance exists |
| Derivatives | [[Taiwan]] risk not explicitly priced |

**The discount question:** Is TSMC cheap because of [[Taiwan]] risk, or despite it?

---

## Investment implications

**For TSMC investors:**
- [[Taiwan]] risk is the bear case
- Discount may be permanent until resolved
- Upside if tensions ease

**For customers:**
- [[GlobalFoundries]] as hedge (US-based, specialty)
- [[Samsung]] as alternative (if execution improves)
- Inventory strategies (buffer stock)

**For the ecosystem:**
- Equipment suppliers less exposed (sell to all)
- Fabless companies most exposed (no alternative)
- Memory less concentrated (Samsung, [[SK Hynix]], [[Micron]])
