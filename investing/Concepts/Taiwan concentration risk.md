~90% of advanced semiconductor production is concentrated in [[Taiwan]], mostly at [[TSMC]]. This represents one of the largest single points of failure in the global economy.

> **Key insight:** [[Taiwan]] risk is priced as an externality, not an execution flaw. Geographic diversification benefits customers more than foundries. The tail risk may be underpriced.

## The concentration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Taiwan]] share of advanced logic (<7nm) | ~90% |
| TSMC share of [[Taiwan]] production | ~85% |
| TSMC share of global advanced logic | ~75-80% |
| Distance from mainland [[China]] | ~100 miles |

**What "advanced" means:** The chips that power AI, smartphones, data centers, military systems.

---

## Why it matters

**Scenarios that would halt global chip supply:**

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [[China]] invasion | Low but non-zero | Catastrophic |
| Blockade | Higher than invasion | Severe |
| Infrastructure attack | Medium | Severe |
| Major earthquake | Low-medium | Moderate-severe |
| Power grid failure | Has happened | Moderate |
| Pandemic/logistics | Proven possible | Moderate |

**Who depends on [[Taiwan]]:**

| Customer | [[Taiwan]] exposure |
|----------|-----------------|
| [[Apple]] | ~100% of iPhone chips |
| [[NVIDIA]] | ~100% of GPUs |
| [[AMD]] | ~100% of CPUs/GPUs |
| [[Qualcomm]] | ~90%+ of mobile chips |
| US military | Critical systems |

---

## Mitigation attempts

**Geographic diversification efforts:**

| Project | Capacity | Timeline | Limitation |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] | ~5% of TSMC | 2025-28 | 1-2 nodes behind [[Taiwan]] |
| [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] | New 2nm capacity | 2026+ | Execution uncertain |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Domestic option | 2025+ | Unproven at leading edge |
| [[Japan]] fabs (TSMC, [[Sony]]) | Specialty | 2024-25 | Mature nodes only |

**The math problem:**
- TSMC [[Taiwan]]: ~15M wafer starts/year (advanced)
- TSMC Arizona (all 3 phases): ~1M wafer starts/year
- [[Gap]]: Still 90%+ in [[Taiwan]] for years

---

## The "insurance" problem

Arizona fabs are framed as "insurance" but:

| [[Insurance]] assumption | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Insured asset survives | [[Taiwan]] fabs would be destroyed/inaccessible |
| Replacement possible | Arizona = 5-10% of capacity |
| Premium is acceptable | $40B+ capex for partial coverage |
| Claim is straightforward | Geopolitical chaos, allocation fights |

**The uncomfortable truth:**
- A real [[Taiwan]] contingency would be existential for TSMC's current form
- Arizona provides *continuity for some customers*, not replacement
- The "insurance" narrative may overstate protection

---

## [[China]]'s calculus

**Why [[China]] might not invade:**
- Economic interdependence ([[China]] needs TSMC too)
- Military cost and uncertainty
- Global economic retaliation
- Fabs would be destroyed/unusable in conflict

**Why the risk is non-zero:**
- Xi has stated reunification goal
- 2027-2030 often cited as risk window
- Blockade is less destructive than invasion
- Accidents and miscalculation possible

---

## How markets price this

| Approach | Current state |
|----------|---------------|
| TSMC valuation | ~15-20x P/E (discount to peers) |
| Customer behavior | Diversification efforts underway |
| [[Insurance]] markets | Political risk insurance exists |
| Derivatives | [[Taiwan]] risk not explicitly priced |

**The discount question:** Is TSMC cheap because of [[Taiwan]] risk, or despite it?

---

## Investment implications

**For TSMC investors:**
- [[Taiwan]] risk is the bear case
- Discount may be permanent until resolved
- Upside if tensions ease

**For customers:**
- [[GlobalFoundries]] as hedge (US-based, specialty)
- [[Samsung]] as alternative (if execution improves)
- Inventory strategies (buffer stock)

**For the ecosystem:**
- Equipment suppliers less exposed (sell to all)
- Fabless companies most exposed (no alternative)
- Memory less concentrated (Samsung, [[SK Hynix]], [[Micron]])

## NYT Investigation (Feb 24, 2026)

A major New York Times investigation by Tripp Mickle — based on document reviews, chip plant visits, and 60+ interviews — revealed previously unreported details about how Washington tried and largely failed to move the industry:

### The classified briefings

| Date | Setting | Participants | Key message |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Fall 2021 | White House, Washington | Top semiconductor executives incl. Pat Gelsinger (Intel) | Blockade/invasion could halt chip manufacturing |
| Feb 2022 | White House call | Executives | Russia's Ukraine invasion proved autocrats will seize territory even if it harms their economy |
| Jul 2023 | Secure briefing room, Silicon Valley | Tim Cook (Apple), Jensen Huang (NVIDIA), Lisa Su (AMD), Cristiano Amon (Qualcomm, via video) | CIA's Burns + DNI Haines: China's military spending could mean a move on Taiwan in 2027 |

**Tim Cook said afterward he "slept with one eye open."** But companies still didn't place significant new orders for US chips.

### SIA/McKinsey confidential report (2022)

Commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association, previously unreported:
- Cutting Taiwan chip supply = **largest economic crisis since the Great Depression**
- US GDP would fall **11%** (2x the 2008 recession)
- China GDP would fall **16%**
- Bloomberg Economics estimates a conflict would cost **>$10 trillion** globally
- Taiwan enables ~$10T of world GDP
- Most US tech companies would have "enough semiconductors for several months" before collapse

Treasury Secretary Bessent (Davos, Jan 2026): *"97% of high-end chips are made in Taiwan. If that island were blockaded, that capacity were destroyed, it would be an economic apocalypse."*

### The collective action failure

Despite $52B CHIPS Act, $200B in planned US fab spending through 2030, and repeated classified warnings:
- US will still account for **only 10% of global semiconductor production in 2030** — same as 2020
- US-made chips cost **25%+ more** than Taiwan equivalents
- Arizona fabs are a **generation behind** Taiwan (unofficial rule: cutting-edge goes to Taiwan first)
- Intel and Samsung couldn't find customers → CHIPS Act grants **cut by $2.3B combined**
- McKinsey's Bill Wiseman: *"Executives think, 'If we're screwed, everyone else is screwed,' so they don't take action."*

### The Lutnick gambit (early 2025)

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick met TSMC CEO C.C. Wei at Cantor Fitzgerald's NY office with an ultimatum: **invest in Intel and operate Intel's fabs, or build more TSMC plants in the US.** This followed Intel leadership visiting Lutnick requesting $50-70B ($25B from government).

Meanwhile, Trump told Jensen Huang in the Oval Office that Xi "breathes heavily" when discussing Taiwan, and urged him to make chips in America. Nvidia subsequently committed to buying from TSMC's Arizona plants.

Raimondo's parting move before leaving office: sent Intel and TSMC a letter saying the government would support their working together, and warned Lutnick directly that "Intel needed help."
