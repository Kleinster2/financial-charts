~90% of advanced semiconductor production is concentrated in Taiwan, mostly at [[TSMC]].

## Why it matters

- Blockade, invasion, or infrastructure destruction could halt global chip supply
- Single earthquake or power grid failure creates worldwide shortage
- U.S./China tensions make this risk non-negligible

## Mitigation attempts

- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] — but only ~5% of capacity
- [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] — U.S.-based production
- [[CHIPS Act]] subsidies driving domestic buildout

## The "insurance" problem

Arizona fabs are framed as "insurance" but:
- Insurance assumes the insured asset survives
- Arizona cannot *replace* Taiwan, only provide continuity for a subset
- A real Taiwan contingency would be existential for TSMC's current form

## Investor implications

- Taiwan risk is priced as an externality, not an execution flaw
- Geographic diversification benefits customers more than foundries
- The tail risk may be underpriced
