**Banking concentration** — [[Market structure]] where few large banks dominate. Creates high barriers to entry, wide spreads, and excess profitability. Not corruption — but raises competition policy questions.

---

## Why banking concentrates

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Economies of scale** | IT, compliance, branch networks have high fixed costs |
| **Regulatory barriers** | Capital requirements, licensing favor incumbents |
| **Deposit stickiness** | Customers rarely switch banks |
| **Too big to fail** | Implicit government backstop for large banks |
| **[[Network effects]]** | Payments, ATMs, correspondent banking |

## How to measure

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CR5** | Share of assets held by top 5 banks |
| **HHI** | Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (sum of squared market shares) |
| **NIM** | Net interest margin — wider in concentrated markets |
| **Spread** | Lending rate minus funding cost |

---

## Country comparison

| Country | CR5 | NIM | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Brazil** | ~80% | 4-5% | Highest spreads globally |
| **Canada** | ~85% | 2-3% | "Big 5" oligopoly, stable |
| **[[Australia]]** | ~75% | 2% | "Big 4" dominance |
| **[[UK]]** | ~70% | 1.5-2% | Big 4 + challengers |
| **US** | ~45% | 3% | More fragmented (regional banks) |
| **[[Germany]]** | ~30% | 1% | Fragmented (Sparkassen, co-ops) |

## Brazil — extreme case

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Big 5 share | ~80% of banking assets |
| Net interest margin | 4-5% |
| [[Consumer]] loan spreads | 40-100%+ above Selic |
| Credit card rates | 300-400%+ APR |
| ROE (Itaú, [[Bradesco]]) | 15-20%+ |

**The Big 5:**

| Bank | Type | Assets |
|------|------|--------|
| [[Itaú Unibanco]] | Private | ~$450B |
| [[Bradesco]] | Private | ~$350B |
| Banco do Brasil | State | ~$400B |
| Caixa Econômica | State | ~$350B |
| Santander Brasil | Foreign (Spain) | ~$200B |

**Why spreads are so high:**

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Concentration** | Few competitors = price power |
| **Historical inflation** | High nominal rates normalized; spreads stayed wide as inflation fell |
| **Credit risk** | High default rates justify some spread — but not 400% credit cards |
| **Judicial recovery** | Collateral enforcement historically slow (improving) |
| **Information asymmetry** | Credit bureaus less developed than US |

**Fintech disruption:**
- [[Nubank]] — 90M+ customers, pressuring fees
- PIX — instant payments reduced interchange revenue
- Inter, [[PicPay]], C6 — digital challengers
- Incumbents adapting (Itaú → Iti, [[Bradesco]] → Next)

Spreads compressing but oligopoly intact — incumbents have scale, funding cost advantage.

## Canada — stable oligopoly

| Bank | Assets (CAD) |
|------|--------------|
| RBC | ~$2T |
| TD | ~$1.9T |
| Scotiabank | ~$1.4T |
| BMO | ~$1.2T |
| CIBC | ~$900B |

**Why it persists:**
- Regulatory preference for "national champions"
- Foreign bank entry restricted historically
- Stable, profitable — no political will to disrupt
- Avoided 2008 crisis → validated model

---

## Investment implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **High ROE** | Concentrated banks are profitable |
| **Defensive** | Oligopolies have pricing power in downturns |
| **Regulatory risk** | Competition policy could force spread compression |
| **Fintech threat** | Varies by market — Brazil more exposed than Canada |
| **Valuation** | Often trade at premium to fragmented markets |

**The trade-off:** Concentration = stability + profitability for shareholders, but higher costs for consumers/borrowers.

## Concentration vs cronyism

| | Banking concentration | [[Bank cronyism]] |
|--|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Mechanism** | [[Market structure]], barriers | Self-dealing, extraction |
| **Legality** | Legal | Illegal (fraud, theft) |
| **Who benefits** | Bank shareholders | Connected insiders |
| **Who loses** | Borrowers (high rates) | Depositors, taxpayers |
| **Bank survival** | Bank thrives | Bank fails |
| **Example** | Itaú's 18% ROE | [[Ayandeh Bank]] looting depositors |

Brazilian state banks (BNDES, Caixa) → [[Bank cronyism]] / [[Brazilian cronyism]].
Brazilian private banks (Itaú, [[Bradesco]]) → concentration (competition issue).

Different problems, different solutions.
