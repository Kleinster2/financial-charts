**1.4nm race** — The next frontier in leading-edge logic after 2nm. [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], and [[Intel]] competing for 2027+ production.

---

## Competitive landscape

| Player | Node name | Target |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[TSMC]] | A14 (1.4nm) | 2027-2028 |
| [[Samsung]] | SF1.4 | 2027 |
| [[Intel]] | 14A | 2027 (ambitious) |

---

## Key enablers

- [[ASML]] High-NA EUV lithography required
- Gate-all-around (GAA) transistors mature
- Backside power delivery (BSPDN)
- [[Advanced packaging]] integration

---

## Why it matters

- Diminishing returns on pure node scaling
- Cost per transistor may stop declining
- Packaging and chiplets becoming more important than monolithic scaling
- See [[Leading edge race]]
