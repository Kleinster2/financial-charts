**1.4nm race** — The next frontier in leading-edge logic after 2nm. [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], and [[Intel]] competing for 2027+ production.

---

## Competitive landscape

| Player | Node name | [[Target]] |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[TSMC]] | A14 (1.4nm) | 2027-2028 |
| [[Samsung]] | SF1.4 | 2027 |
| [[Intel]] | 14A | 2027 (ambitious) |

---

## Key enablers

- [[ASML]] High-NA EUV lithography required
- Gate-all-around (GAA) transistors mature
- Backside power delivery (BSPDN)
- [[Advanced packaging]] integration
- **Heavy rare earths** ([[Dysprosium]], [[Terbium]]) for EUV stage magnets

---

## Rare earth dependency

High-NA EUV machines require Dy/Tb magnets for wafer/reticle stage positioning. [[China]] controls 99% of processing.

**Risk**: REE export restrictions could bottleneck High-NA EUV production — constraining the very equipment needed for 1.4nm ramps.

**Mitigation**: REAlloys $21M SRC deal (Dec 2025) to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027.

## Why it matters

- Diminishing returns on pure node scaling
- Cost per transistor may stop declining
- Packaging and chiplets becoming more important than monolithic scaling
- See [[Leading edge race]]
