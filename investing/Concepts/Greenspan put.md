**Greenspan put** — Market expectation that the [[Federal Reserve]] will cut rates or provide liquidity to rescue falling asset prices. Named for [[Alan Greenspan]]'s response to 1987 crash.

## Mechanism

| Phase | Fed action | Market effect |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Market stress | Cut rates, inject liquidity | Limits downside |
| Recovery | Slow to tighten | Encourages risk-taking |
| Next cycle | Repeat | Asymmetric payoff profile |

Moral hazard: investors take more risk knowing the Fed will cushion falls.

| Event | Fed Chair | Response |

| 1998 LTCM | Greenspan | Rate cuts |

## Warsh tension (Jan 2026)

[[Martin Sandbu]] argues the real challenge for [[Kevin Warsh]] isn't monetary policy but navigating the tension between:
- His "tough love" instinct (let markets correct)
- Trump's expectation of a "turbocharged Greenspan put" at first sign of trouble

> "That tension, rather than monetary policy, may be the real challenge Warsh will sooner or later have to face."
