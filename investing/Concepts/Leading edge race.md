Tracking the 2nm node competition (2024-2026).

---

## TSMC

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Taiwan ramp | 2025 |
| Arizona | 2028 (constrained by N-2 rule) |
| Yields | **65%**, targeting 75% |
| Capacity | Locked by Apple/NVIDIA |

The benchmark. See [[TSMC]], [[TSMC Arizona expansion]].

*Update 2025-12-29: N-2 rule restricts leading-edge overseas. AMD/Google may turn to Samsung.*

---

## Samsung

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Taylor target | 2026-2027 |
| Yields | **40%** (Dec 2025) |
| Key customer | Tesla ($16.5B deal) |
| Potential | AMD EPYC Venice (decision Jan 2026) |

High variance bet. See [[Samsung]], [[Samsung Taylor pivot]].

*Update 2025-12-29: Yields lower than previously reported. AMD in talks for 2nm EPYC — would be major win.*

---

## Intel

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Intel 18A target | 2025 |
| Yields | **55%**, targeting 65-70% Q4 2025 |
| Key milestone | Fab 52 (Arizona) producing Panther Lake |

Make-or-break node. See [[Intel Foundry Services]], [[Will Intel Foundry Services succeed]].

*Update 2025-12-29: Yields improving. Gelsinger resigned Dec 1.*

---

## Rapidus (Japan)

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Target | 2027 (small volume) |
| Yields | Unknown (pilot line) |
| Technology | IBM 2nm GAA process |
| Model | Small batch (not high-volume) |

National champion bet. See [[Rapidus]].

*Added 2025-12-29: Optimistic sentiment at SEMICON Japan. Suppliers confident in 2027. Different model — small batch, metrology-heavy.*

## Timeline

```
2025 Q1  TSMC 2nm ramp (Taiwan)
2025 ??  Intel 18A target (slipping?)
2026-27  Samsung 2nm (Taylor)
2027     Rapidus 2nm (small volume)
2028     TSMC 2nm (Arizona)
```

## What to watch

- [ ] TSMC 2nm yield reports
- [ ] Samsung Taylor production start
- [ ] Intel 18A delay announcements
- [ ] Rapidus pilot line progress / first wafers
- [ ] First major customer wins at 2nm (non-TSMC)
