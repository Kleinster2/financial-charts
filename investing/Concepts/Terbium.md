**Terbium** — The dual-role rare earth. Works as both a [[Dysprosium]] substitute in magnets AND produces green phosphors. 99% China-controlled. Bridges the magnet-phosphor divide.

---

## Why terbium is unique

Terbium is the only heavy REE with critical roles in BOTH major applications:

| Application | Role | Substitutes |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Magnets** | Dy substitute for thermal stability | Only Dy |
| **Phosphors** | Green color in displays/LEDs | Limited |

This dual role makes terbium strategically distinct from [[Dysprosium]] (magnets only) and [[Europium]] (phosphors only).

---

## Magnet applications

### Dysprosium substitute

Terbium can replace dysprosium in NdFeB magnets to improve high-temperature performance:

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Thermal stability | Maintains magnetism at 150-200°C |
| Coercivity | Prevents demagnetization |
| Interchangeability | ~1:1 with Dy in many applications |

**Trade-off**: Terbium is more expensive than dysprosium ($450-600/kg vs $300-400/kg). Used when Dy is unavailable or for premium applications.

### End uses

| Sector | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| EVs | Traction motor magnets |
| Wind turbines | Generator magnets |
| Defense | Guidance systems, motors |
| Aerospace | High-temp environments |
| **Semiconductor equipment** | High-NA EUV stage magnets |

### Semiconductor equipment angle

Terbium (alongside [[Dysprosium]]) is used in precision magnets for [[ASML]] High-NA EUV lithography:

- Wafer/reticle stage positioning
- Nanometer-precision actuators
- High-temperature stability in cleanroom operation

**REAlloys deal (Dec 2025)**: $21M SRC investment targets Tb/Dy for semiconductor equipment — scaling North American output 300% by 2027 to support [[1.4nm race]] ramps.

## Phosphor applications

### Green phosphor

Terbium produces the green component in RGB displays:

| Technology | Terbium role |
|------------|--------------|
| LED lighting | Green phosphor (Tb³⁺) |
| Displays | Color rendering |
| Night vision | Green-hued visibility |
| Medical imaging | Scintillators |

Works alongside [[Europium]] (red) and yttrium (blue) to create full-color displays.

## China dominance

| Stage | China share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | ~90% |
| Processing | ~99% |
| Magnets | ~99% |

**Same vulnerability as Dysprosium**: Near-total Chinese control of heavy rare earth processing.

---

## Supply alternatives

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Browns Range, Australia | One of few non-China Tb sources |
| Greenland | Exploration stage |
| Canada | Small projects |
| Recycling | Early stage |

Browns Range (Northern Minerals) is notable as one of the only operating non-Chinese heavy rare earth projects.

## 2025 export controls

Terbium was targeted in China's April 2025 restrictions:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Apr 4, 2025 | Terbium added to export license requirements |
| Nov 7, 2025 | Controls suspended for 1 year |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for full timeline.

## Future demand

Wind energy alone will drive massive Tb demand growth:

| Timeframe | Projected demand increase |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| By 2040 | **20x current levels** |
| vs Dysprosium | Tb grows faster (20x vs 13x) |
| vs Neodymium | Tb grows faster (20x vs 16x) |

Terbium may face the tightest supply-demand squeeze of any rare earth by 2040.

## Terbium vs Dysprosium vs Europium

| Aspect | Terbium | [[Dysprosium]] | [[Europium]] |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Primary use | Both | Magnets | Phosphors |
| Magnet role | Dy substitute | Primary | None |
| Phosphor role | Green | None | Red |
| Price | $450-600/kg | $300-400/kg | $30-50/kg |
| 2040 demand growth | 20x | 13x | Moderate |
| China control | 99% | 99% | 95% |

**Terbium's unique position**: If Dysprosium runs short, Terbium is the only fallback. But Terbium is also needed for phosphors. Double squeeze potential.

---

## Investment implications

**Strategic value:**
- Dual magnet/phosphor demand
- Dy substitute = insurance policy
- Fastest projected demand growth
- Extremely limited non-China supply

**Watch for:**
- Browns Range production ramp
- Terbium-Dysprosium price spread
- Wind turbine magnet specifications
- China export policy changes
