# Short interest

#concept #markets #signals

**Short interest** — Percentage of shares sold short as a fraction of free float. Contrarian indicator: low short interest after a parabolic run can signal crowded longs with no one left to buy; high short interest can signal skepticism or set up squeezes.

## What short interest tells you

| Level | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| **High** (>5-10%) | Bearish conviction, potential squeeze setup |
| **Rising** | Growing skepticism, hedging activity |
| **Low** (<1%) | Consensus bullish, bears capitulated |
| **Falling after run-up** | Shorts covering, capitulation |

## Interpretation framework

### Low short interest + parabolic run = caution signal

When a stock 3-4x's and short interest *falls*, it suggests:
- Bears have given up
- Thesis is consensus (everyone agrees)
- Crowded long positioning
- **Who's left to buy?**

Not necessarily bearish — could mean fundamentals are bulletproof. But worth monitoring.

### High short interest = potential energy

High short interest creates:
- Squeeze risk (forced buying on rallies)
- Natural buying pressure if thesis plays out
- Contrarian opportunity if shorts are wrong

## TSMC case study (Jan 2026)

See [[TSMC]] for full quarterly history. Summary:

| Period | SI % | Stock | Context |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 2010-11 | **1.5-1.7%** | NT$60-80 | Historical peak |
| 2023 avg | 0.3-0.5% | NT$400 | Pre-AI baseline |
| **Q1 2026** | **0.5%** | NT$1,600+ | ATH, 4x run |

**The puzzle:** Stock 4x'd, short interest stayed flat/low.

**Interpretation:**
- AI monopoly thesis is consensus — no one wants to fight it
- Taiwan geopolitical risk NOT being hedged via shorting (surprising)
- Could be crowded, or could be that fundamental case is bulletproof

**Watch for:** Rising short interest = emerging skepticism on AI demand or Taiwan risk.
