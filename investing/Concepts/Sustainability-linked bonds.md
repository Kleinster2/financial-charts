**Sustainability-linked bonds** (SLBs) — Bonds with financial terms tied to achieving sustainability targets (KPIs). Coupon steps up if targets missed. Contrasts with [[Green bonds]] where proceeds must fund green projects.

## How SLBs work

**Performance-based, not use-of-proceeds:**

1. Issuer sets Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs)
2. KPIs measured at specified dates
3. If targets missed → coupon increases (typically 25-75 bps)
4. Proceeds can be used for any corporate purpose

## SLB vs Green Bond

| Feature | [[Green bonds]] | **SLBs** |
|---------|------------|------|
| Proceeds | Restricted to green projects | General corporate use |
| Verification | Use-of-proceeds tracked | KPI achievement verified |
| Financial penalty | None | Coupon step-up if target missed |
| Best for | Companies with defined green capex | Companies improving operations |
| Criticism risk | Greenwashing if projects weak | Target-washing if KPIs easy |

---

## Common KPIs

| Category | Example KPIs |
|----------|--------------|
| Emissions | Scope 1+2 reduction %, carbon intensity |
| Energy | Renewable energy %, [[PUE]] improvement |
| Water | Water intensity, recycling rate |
| Social | Diversity targets, safety metrics |
| Circular | Recycled content %, waste reduction |

---

## Why SLBs matter

**Flexibility with accountability:**

- **General use**: Proceeds not restricted to green capex
- **Whole-company**: Incentivizes enterprise-wide sustainability
- **Skin in the game**: Financial cost for missing targets
- **Growth**: $70B+ annual issuance

## Criticism

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Weak targets | KPIs sometimes set below business-as-usual trajectory |
| Low penalties | 25 bps step-up is immaterial for many issuers |
| Verification | Third-party verification quality varies |
| "Target-washing" | Easy KPIs chosen to avoid step-up |

## Brazil context

**[[Scala Data Centers]] chose green debentures over SLBs** for its BRL 2B issuance (Dec 2022) because:

- Already operating sustainably (not just future targets)
- 100% renewable energy, zero water, [[PUE]] <1.40
- Green debenture validated existing performance
- SLB would have required future improvement targets
