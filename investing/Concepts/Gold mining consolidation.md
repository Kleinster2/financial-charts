**Gold mining consolidation** — Record gold prices ($5,000+/oz) are driving a wave of M&A as miners chase reserves. Large producers prefer acquiring proven assets over developing new mines.

---

## Why consolidation is accelerating

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Record gold prices** | Boosted margins + cash flows fund deals |
| **Reserve depletion** | Majors need to replace depleting mines |
| **Development costs** | Easier to buy than build (permitting, capex) |
| **Equity valuations** | Strong share prices = acquisition currency |
| **China expansion** | [[Zijin Mining]] aggressively acquiring globally |

## Consolidation dynamics

### Buyers

| Type | Strategy | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Chinese majors** | Global expansion, reserve security | [[Zijin Mining]] |
| **Western majors** | Portfolio optimization, synergies | [[Newmont]], [[Barrick Gold]] |
| **Mid-tiers** | Growth via acquisition | [[Agnico Eagle]] |

### Targets

- African assets (Zijin focus)
- Latin American projects
- Australian/Canadian juniors
- Distressed assets from majors trimming portfolios

---

## Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Top-of-cycle pricing** | Buying at peak valuations destroys value |
| **Integration challenges** | Geographies, cultures, operations |
| **Cost inflation** | Labor, energy, equipment costs rising |
| **Political risk** | African/LatAm jurisdictions |
| **Overpaying** | Competitive bidding inflates prices |

**Historical warning:** Previous gold booms (2011-2012) saw miners make expensive acquisitions that weighed on returns for years.

## Investment implications

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Majors acquiring | Bullish on gold price outlook |
| Premium valuations | Reserves scarce, competition intense |
| Chinese buyers active | Strategic + commercial drivers |
| Divestitures by majors | Portfolio optimization, not bearish |
