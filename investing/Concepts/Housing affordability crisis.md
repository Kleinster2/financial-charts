**Housing affordability crisis** — Structural breakdown in housing economics. Median home now 5x median income (vs 3x traditional threshold). 75% of households can't afford median-priced new home. Root cause of institutional homebuying ban and GSE reform pressure.

## How bad is it?

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Price-to-income ratio | **5x** | Traditionally 3x = affordable |
| Housing cost share of income | **47%** | Atlanta Fed, mid-2025 |
| Households priced out | **75%** (100.6M) | Can't afford median new home |
| Home prices since 2019 | +60% | |
| Mortgage payment vs rent | **+$1,091/month** | Starter homes |

**NAHB (2025):** Median new home price $459,826 at 6.5% mortgage rate prices out 3 in 4 households.

## The math

**What $100K income could afford:**

| Year | Share of listings |
|------|-------------------|
| 2019 | 65% |
| 2025 | **37%** |

**Since 2000:**
- Home prices: **+177%** (nominal)
- Household income: **+8.5%** (inflation-adjusted)
- Home prices: **+56%** (inflation-adjusted)

## Regional variation

| Region | Price-to-income |
|--------|-----------------|
| National | 4.6x |
| California | 8.2x |
| Hawaii | 8.8x |
| Top 10 states | 5.8x+ (8 of 10 in West) |

## Causes

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Housing shortage]] | 3.7–7.2M unit deficit |
| Post-2008 underbuilding | Decade of suppressed construction |
| Millennial demand | Largest generation hitting prime buying years |
| Mortgage rates | 6.5%+ vs 3% in 2021 |
| Wage stagnation | Income growth lagged prices |
| Zoning/regulation | Restricts new supply |
| Investor competition | Institutional + mom-and-pop buyers |
