Chips flowing from [[Taiwan]] through [[Southeast Asia]] to [[China]] — representing ~15-20% of NVIDIA's GPU sales. **Current tailwind, future risk.**

---

## The dynamic

NVIDIA publicly claims "zero [[China]] forecast" while chips reach [[China]] through SEA. This is extra revenue today, but carries embedded risks.

**Jensen quotes (Dec 2025 Bloomberg):**
- "Our forecast for [[China]] is zero. All of our guidance starts at zero."
- "The Chinese market is very large this year. My guess is probably about $50 billion."
- "We've repeatedly tested and sampled data centers around the world and found no diversion."

**Key insight (Kakashiii analysis):**
- Jensen's "$50B guess" isn't a guess — it's based on actual gray market flows
- Allowing legal [[China]] sales wouldn't *increase* NVIDIA sales — just convert gray to legal
- "Zero forecast" creates upside surprise optics when revenue is already baked in

## SEA import data (Jan-Oct 2025)

[[Taiwan]] chip exports to [[Southeast Asia]] (primarily NVIDIA GPUs):

| Country | Imports | Share |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Malaysia** | $12B | Largest corridor |
| **Singapore** | $7B | Removed from reporting |
| **Thailand** | $3B | Growing |
| **Indonesia** | $1.2B | Growing |
| **Total** | **$23B** | 17.5% of NVIDIA DC revenue |

**Kakashiii forecast:** $35-40B by year-end 2025, $50B in 2026.

---

## Accounting red flags

**Geographic reporting changes:**
- NVIDIA changed geographic revenue definition **twice** in <1 year
- Singapore removed via "customer headquarters" redefinition
- Creates opacity around SEA flows

**The question:** If there's no diversion, why change geographic reporting methodology repeatedly?

---

## Legal enforcement

**Recent action (Jan 2026):**
- US District Court, Northern District of California
- Charged individuals with NVIDIA GPU smuggling from US
- Validates that enforcement views smuggling as real, not speculation

---

## Post-[[DeepSeek]] shift

**New pattern emerging:**
Instead of smuggling chips into mainland [[China]], Chinese tech firms now building data centers directly in SEA:

| Location | Activity |
|----------|----------|
| Malaysia | Dozens of Chinese-built DCs |
| Thailand | Growing DC presence |
| Indonesia | Expanding rapidly |

**Why the shift:**
- Less regulatory scrutiny than mainland imports
- [[DeepSeek]] moment increased enforcement attention
- SEA governments welcome investment
- Chips stay "in SEA" technically (not diversion)

---

## Chinese companies are major NVIDIA buyers

Despite "zero [[China]] forecast," Chinese companies are #2 and #3 NVIDIA customers (2024 Hopper shipments, [[Omdia]]):

| Customer | GPUs (000s) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| [[Microsoft]] | ~485K | #1 |
| **ByteDance** | **~250K** | #2, Chinese |
| **Tencent** | **~220K** | #3, Chinese |
| [[Meta]] | ~200K | |
| [[Tesla]]/[[xAI]] | ~170K | |

**ByteDance + Tencent = ~470K Hopper GPUs in 2024** — nearly as much as [[Microsoft]].

Where are these chips deployed? Much of it likely flows through SEA.

---

## Scale vs known demand

**The math question:**

| Source | NVIDIA GPUs needed |
|--------|-------------------|
| ByteDance SEA operations | ~250K Hopper equivalent? |
| Tencent SEA | ~220K Hopper equivalent? |
| Alibaba SEA | Some |
| Local SEA companies | Limited |
| **Actual [[Taiwan]] → SEA imports** | **$23B Jan-Oct** |

Does SEA's legitimate AI compute demand justify $23B+ in chip imports? Or is surplus flowing to mainland [[China]]?

---

## NVIDIA's position

**Jensen's defense:**
- "We've chased down every single concern"
- "Repeatedly tested and sampled data centers around the world"
- "Found no diversion"
- US Commerce Department corroborates (per Jensen)

**Skeptic response:**
- Sampling likely doesn't cover Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia
- Accounting changes suggest awareness of sensitivity
- $50B "guess" aligns suspiciously well with smuggling estimates

## How to interpret

| Lens | Gray market is... |
|------|-------------------|
| **Bull** | Extra ~15-20% revenue; if legalized, converts to clean sales with no downside |
| **Bear** | Revenue NVIDIA can't acknowledge; could vanish if crackdown succeeds |
| **Neutral** | Legal [[China]] sales wouldn't *increase* revenue — just relabel it |

---

## Implications

**For [[NVIDIA]]:**
- **Today:** Gray market = tailwind, ~15-20% extra revenue
- **Risk:** Legal exposure if found complicit, investor trust if becomes scandal
- **Upside:** If export controls relax, gray converts to clean with same revenue
- **Downside:** If enforcement succeeds, could lose meaningful revenue

**For [[Export controls]]:**
- Policy may be less effective than assumed
- SEA = major leakage route
- Enforcement playing catch-up
- Chinese DC buildout in SEA = legal workaround

**For [[Southeast Asia tech race]]:**
- Chinese DC buildout = real infrastructure investment
- SEA countries benefit either way (investment or transit)
- Positioned as "neutral ground" for AI compute
- Creates geopolitical complexity for [[ASEAN]]
