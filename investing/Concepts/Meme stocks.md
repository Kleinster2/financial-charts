**Meme stocks** — Social media-coordinated buying campaigns targeting heavily shorted stocks. Born on Reddit's WallStreetBets in January 2021 with [[GameStop]], the phenomenon exposed systemic vulnerabilities, permanently elevated [[Retail investor flows|retail participation]], and forced Wall Street to build new risk tools. Five years later, the playbook has evolved: companies exploit it (shelf registrations), institutions monitor it (VandaTrack), and the speculative energy has migrated to crypto and prediction markets.

## The mechanics

A meme stock squeeze requires three ingredients:

1. **High short interest** — Ideally >50% of float, creating recall spiral risk
2. **Viral coordination** — Reddit/X/[[Discord]] communities identify target and build conviction
3. **Diamond hands ideology** — Holders refuse to sell, preventing shorts from covering

The January 2021 [[GameStop]] squeeze was the purest expression: SI exceeded 100% of float, meaning shorts could not mathematically cover without bidding the stock "to infinity" (Thomas Peterffy, [[Interactive Brokers]]).

## Timeline of meme events

| Date | Stock | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Jan 2021 | [[GameStop]] (GME) | $4 → $120 (split-adj); [[Melvin Capital]] destroyed; trading halted |
| Jan-Feb 2021 | AMC Entertainment | Squeezed; used surge to issue stock, avoid bankruptcy |
| Jan 2021 | BlackBerry, [[Nokia]], Bed Bath & Beyond | Sympathetic squeezes |
| 2021-2022 | Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) | Multiple pumps; bankrupt Aug 2023 |
| May 2024 | GameStop (round 2) | Keith Gill ("Roaring Kitty") returned to X; brief spike |
| Jul 2025 | Opendoor Technologies | "Open Army" turned activist — ousted CEO Wheeler, installed co-founder Rabois |

## Two corporate strategies emerged

### 1. Capitalize (smart)

Issue equity during surges to build cash reserves:

| Company | Result |
|---------|--------|
| [[GameStop]] | $8.8B cash + $519M Bitcoin; eliminated bankruptcy risk |
| AMC | Avoided bankruptcy through repeated equity issuance |

Jim Chanos: GameStop "took big advantage of the moves and sold a lot of equity... a very, very smart thing to do. A lot of meme stocks more recently have not done that."

### 2. Ignore (fatal)

Companies that didn't issue equity during surges often returned to distress. Bed Bath & Beyond: bankrupt August 2023.

## The shelf registration arms race

Jason Mudrick (Mudrick Capital): Companies now pre-file paperwork to quickly issue stock if meme crowds arrive. The process takes months to push through, so firms must plan in advance.

"The lawyers are advising their clients that you should do this, so I do think it has changed things in that everybody is now prepared."

This is now standard corporate legal counsel for any company with meaningful short interest.

## Wall Street adaptation

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **VandaTrack** | Retail flow tracking; launched 2021; institutional risk management |
| **Social monitoring** | Trading desks check X/Reddit for unexplained moves |
| **Retail sentiment data** | Buy-side uses to identify crowded positions |
| **Reduced short exposure** | Managers far more cautious about crowded shorts |
| **Meme ETFs** | Roundhill MEME ETF (relaunched 2025, actively managed, weekly rebalance) |

Viraj Patel (VandaTrack): First institutional question when a short squeezes is whether retail is behind it. "It's still a pretty new science... more and more people just cannot afford to not stay on top of it."

## Evolution: beyond stocks

The speculative energy didn't disappear — it migrated:

| Venue | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| **[[Crypto]]** | "Everything that happened in GameStop is happening in crypto but on steroids" — Amanda Fischer |
| **Prediction markets** | Polymarket, Kalshi — newest speculation venue |
| **Sports betting** | Same demographic, same dopamine |
| **[[Meme coins]]** | Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, celebrity tokens, AI agent coins |
| **Retail activism** | Opendoor "Open Army" (Jul 2025) — meme energy channeled into corporate governance |

Roundhill CEO Dave Mazza: "In today's meme stock world, it's really more about cutting-edge themes... themes that retail can kind of be the price-setter in."

## The unpatched risk

Thomas Peterffy (Jan 2026): The mechanisms that would have caused a [[GameStop]]-style systemic spiral remain unfixed. Current rules still allow:
- [[Short interest]] to exceed 100% of float (rehypothecation)
- No escalating margin requirements on crowded shorts
- No position limits at extreme SI levels

See [[Retail investor flows]] for IBKR's proposed (unadopted) reforms.
