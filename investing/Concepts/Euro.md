## Why EUR strengthened in 2025

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Fed pivot** | Fed cut more aggressively than ECB |
| **Rate differential narrowing** | [[Gap]] closed from 200bp to 100bp |
| **German fiscal shift** | Schuldenbremse reform → stimulus hopes |
| **Risk appetite** | EUR is pro-cyclical, gains in risk-on |

## ECB vs Fed divergence

| Central bank | 2024 peak | Jan 2026 | Direction |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Fed | 5.50% | 3.50-3.75% | Cutting |
| ECB | 4.00% | 2.50% | Cutting slower |

ECB more cautious on cuts due to sticky services inflation. Supports EUR vs USD.

---

## Structural factors

**Positive:**
- Current account surplus (Germany, Netherlands)
- No twin deficit problem (unlike US)
- Reserve currency status (~20% of global reserves)

**Negative:**
- Growth differential (US > [[Europe]])
- Energy dependence ([[Russia]] gas crisis legacy)
- Political fragmentation risk (Italy, [[France]])

## Key levels

| Level | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| 1.00 (parity) | Psychological, touched Sep 2022 |
| 1.05 | Major support |
| 1.10 | Fair value zone |
| 1.15 | Resistance (pre-2022 range) |
| 1.20 | Strong EUR (2021 highs) |

---

## Fragmentation risk

Euro's existential risk is eurozone breakup pressure:

| Crisis | EURUSD impact |
|--------|---------------|
| 2011-12 debt crisis | 1.50 → 1.20 |
| 2022 energy crisis | 1.15 → 0.96 |
| Italy political risk | Spread widening → EUR weakness |

**ECB backstop:** TPI (Transmission Protection Instrument) designed to prevent fragmentation.

## German fiscal expansion (2025)

[[Schuldenbremse reform]] enables €1T+ borrowing:
- Infrastructure spending
- [[Defense]] buildup
- Could boost eurozone growth
- EUR positive if growth materializes
