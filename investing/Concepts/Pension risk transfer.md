**Pension risk transfer** — Corporate sponsors offload defined benefit pension liabilities to insurers via group annuity contracts. US market $51.8B in 2024 (+14% YoY, record 794 contracts). Global market heading for £1T over the next decade. Key demand driver for the [[PE-insurance convergence]].

## Why this matters

PRT is the transmission mechanism converting corporate pension obligations into insurance AUM. Every dollar of pension liability transferred becomes investable capital for PE-owned insurers like [[Athene]], [[Global Atlantic]], and [[Fortitude Re]].

## How it works

```
Corporate pension sponsor (underfunded or fully funded)
        ↓
Transfers pension liabilities to insurer (group annuity contract)
        ↓
Insurer assumes obligation to pay retirees
        ↓
Sponsor pays premium (= present value of liabilities + insurer profit margin)
        ↓
Insurer invests premium as float → earns spread
```

**Types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Buy-in** | Insurer covers liabilities but pension plan continues to exist |
| **Buyout** | Full transfer — plan terminates, insurer pays retirees directly |
| **Longevity swap** | Transfers only longevity risk, not investment risk |
| **Lift-out** | Partial transfer of specific participant groups |

## Why now? (demand drivers)

1. **Funded status improved** — higher rates in 2022-2024 pushed many plans to fully-funded
2. **PBGC premiums rising** — makes maintaining plans expensive for sponsors
3. **Accounting simplification** — removes pension volatility from corporate earnings
4. **Regulatory pressure** — sponsors want to de-risk before next downturn
5. **CEO/CFO preference** — legacy pensions seen as distracting from core business

## PE-insurance connection

PRT is the single largest source of *block* inflows for PE-owned insurers. Unlike retail annuity sales (steady, granular), PRT deals are lumpy multi-billion transactions that require massive capital.

This is why [[Reinsurance sidecars]] exist — [[Athene]]'s ACRA was specifically designed to provide capital for PRT deals. Most PRT deals go through ACRA because the capital requirements exceed what Athene's balance sheet alone can support.

**Capacity constraints (Q4 2025):** Some carriers unable to participate in new transactions — demand exceeding capital availability. Signals strong pricing power for incumbents.

---

## Investment implications

**For PE-insurers:** PRT = large, predictable blocks of long-duration liabilities. Ideal for private credit deployment. Competitive moat via capital scale.

**For plan sponsors:** Increasingly attractive as funded ratios improve. Expect acceleration of full plan terminations.

**For traditional insurers:** UK market seeing M&A (3 of 11 active bulk annuity insurers acquired by international insurers in 2025). Scale matters.
