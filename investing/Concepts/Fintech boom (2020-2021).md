# [[Fintech]] boom (2020-2021)

**Record venture funding into fintech ($132B in 2021) followed by 72% crash in 2022.** Zero rates + COVID digital acceleration + stimulus created perfect conditions. Fed hikes exposed fragile business models (especially BNPL). Most 2021 unicorns never grew into their valuations.

## The boom

| Metric | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Global fintech funding | ~$50B | **$132B** | $75B |
| Share of all VC | — | 21% | — |
| Mega-rounds ($100M+) | — | Record | -60% |

### What drove it

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Zero rates** | Cheap capital, low discount rates inflated DCFs |
| **COVID acceleration** | Digital payments adoption jumped 5+ years |
| **Stimulus checks** | [[Consumer]] spending + retail trading boom |
| **BNPL tailwind** | Low rates = cheap to fund loans |
| **[[Crypto]] adjacency** | Blockchain/DeFi hype lifted all fintech |

## Peak valuations (2021-early 2022)

| Company | Peak valuation | Peak date | Trough | Cut |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|-----|
| [[Stripe]] | $95B (announced) / $201B (secondary) | Mar 2021 / Jan 2022 | ~$50B (2023) | -75% |
| [[Klarna]] | $45.6B | Jun 2021 | $6.7B (Jul 2022) | **-85%** |
| [[Checkout.com]] | $40B | Jan 2022 | ~$11B (2024) | -73% |
| [[Chime]] | $25B | Aug 2021 | ~$8-10B (IPO target) | -60% |
| [[Plaid]] | $13.4B | Apr 2021 | $6.1B (2025) | -54% |
| [[Brex]] | $12.3B | Jan 2022 | $5.15B (acquired) | **-58%** |
| [[Marqeta]] | $21B (IPO peak) | Jun 2021 | ~$2B | -90% |

## The crash (2022)

### By the numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| F-Prime [[Fintech]] Index peak | $1.3T (late 2021) |
| F-Prime [[Fintech]] Index trough | $397B (end 2022) |
| Index decline | **-72%** |
| Series B+ valuation decline | -60%+ |
| Global funding decline | -46% YoY |

### The trigger: Fed rate hikes

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Nov 2021 | Fed signals taper | Growth stocks wobble |
| **Mar 2022** | First rate hike (0.25%) | [[Fintech]] selloff begins |
| Jun 2022 | 75bp hike (aggressive) | Klarna down round (-85%) |
| Jul 2023 | Peak rates (5.25%) | Trough valuations |

### The cascade

| Channel | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **DCF math** | Higher discount rates crushed growth valuations; 50x revenue at 0% → 10x at 5% |
| **BNPL unit economics** | Funded loans at ~0%, charged 3-6%; when funding hit 5%+, margins went negative |
| **Credit losses** | Consumers creditworthy in stimulus 2021 started defaulting in 2022-23 |
| **Public → private contagion** | Public fintechs crashed 72% → mutual funds marked down private holdings → down rounds |
| **Tech vs bank gap** | Private investors valued as tech (20-50x rev); public markets valued as banks (1-3x book) |

**Core insight:** The boom was a levered bet on rates staying low. When that assumption broke, everything built on it collapsed.

### Notable down rounds

| Company | Before | After | Cut | Date |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|------|
| [[Klarna]] | $45.6B | $6.7B | -85% | Jul 2022 |
| [[Checkout.com]] | $40B | Internal marks ~$11B | -73% | 2023-24 |
| [[Instacart]] | $39B | $13B (IPO) | -67% | Sep 2023 |

## Structural lessons

### "Tech company" vs "financial services company"

> "Private investors had largely valued fintech companies as tech companies, and public investors valued them largely as financial services businesses."
> — David Jegen, F-Prime Capital

| Valuation lens | Multiple basis | Implication |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Tech** | Revenue, growth | 20-50x revenue |
| **Financial services** | Book value, ROE | 1-3x book |

Most 2021 fintechs were valued as tech but had bank economics.

### BNPL: The poster child

| Metric | Bull case (2021) | Reality (2022+) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Unit economics | Positive with 0% rates | Negative with 5%+ rates |
| Credit losses | "Tech-enabled underwriting" | Worse than credit cards |
| Merchant fees | 3-6% sustainable | Compressed by competition |
| Regulation | Light touch | CFPB scrutiny |

## Recovery (2024-2026)

| Company | 2021 peak | 2022-23 trough | Current (Jan 2026) | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| [[Klarna]] | $45.6B | $6.7B | ~$15-20B | IPO filed |
| [[Stripe]] | $95-201B | ~$50B | ~$70B+ | IPO expected 2026 |
| [[Chime]] | $25B | — | ~$10B | IPO filed |
| [[Brex]] | $12.3B | — | $5.15B | **Acquired** by [[Capital One]] |
| [[Plaid]] | $13.4B | — | $6.1B | Not going public 2025 |

**Pattern:** Survivors are reaching ~30-50% of peak valuations. M&A picking up distressed assets. IPO window reopening but at steep discounts.

## Investment relevance

**Why the fintech boom matters:**

1. **Valuation anchor** — 2021 peaks are still the reference point; most haven't recovered.

2. **Business model filter** — Exposed which fintechs were real (payments, infrastructure) vs fragile (BNPL, neobanks without deposits).

3. **Exit expectations** — IPO candidates now pricing at 50-70% below peak.

4. **M&A opportunity** — [[Capital One]]-[[Brex]] pattern: strategics buying at discount.

5. **Rate sensitivity** — Proved fintech is a levered bet on rates.
