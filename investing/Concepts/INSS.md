**INSS** (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social) — [[Brazil]]'s social security system. Administers retirement pensions, disability benefits, and death benefits. ~37M beneficiaries.

Key to financial sector because of **consignado** (payroll-deductible loans) — banks can deduct loan payments directly from INSS benefits, creating a low-risk, high-margin lending segment (~R$700B outstanding stock). INSS accreditation is a regulatory barrier: requires banking license, physical presence, and personal advisory capability.
