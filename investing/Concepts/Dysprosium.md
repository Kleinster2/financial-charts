**Dysprosium** — The most strategically constrained rare earth element. Enables permanent magnets to function at high temperatures. 99% China-controlled. No substitutes.

---

## Why dysprosium is the chokepoint

| Property | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| 99% China control | Near-total monopoly |
| No substitutes | Can't engineer around it |
| Essential for EVs | Motors run at 150-180°C |
| Essential for defense | Precision-guided systems |
| Low volume, high impact | 20-60g per EV, but irreplaceable |

**The physics**: Dysprosium's f¹⁰ electron configuration allows it to maintain magnetic properties at high temperatures. This is a fundamental atomic property — no other element replicates it.

---

## The temperature problem

NdFeB magnets (neodymium-iron-boron) are the strongest permanent magnets. But they weaken with heat:

| Dy content | Strength loss at 150°C |
|------------|------------------------|
| 0% | 50% loss |
| 6% | 15% loss |

EV traction motors operate at 150-180°C. Without dysprosium, the magnets fail.

**No workaround**: You can't cool the motor enough. You can't use weaker magnets (range/performance suffers). You need dysprosium.

## Supply chain

| Stage | China share | Non-China |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Mining | ~90% | Myanmar (conflict), minor others |
| Separation | ~99% | Virtually none |
| Magnet production | ~99% | Japan (tiny) |

**The separation bottleneck**: Heavy rare earths like Dy require specialized separation from ore. China has 99% of global capacity. Even ore mined elsewhere goes to China for processing.

## Demand by sector

| Application | Dy per unit | Growth driver |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| EV motors | 20-60g | EV transition |
| Wind turbines | 100-200g/MW | Clean energy |
| Defense systems | Varies | Geopolitical tension |
| Industrial motors | Varies | Efficiency mandates |

**EV math**: 80M vehicles/year × 40g average = 3,200 tonnes Dy demand from EVs alone. Global production: ~2,000 tonnes/year.

## 2025 export controls

China specifically targeted dysprosium in April 2025:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Apr 4, 2025 | Dy added to export license requirement |
| Oct 9, 2025 | Controls tightened further |
| Dec 1, 2025 | Military buyers denied entirely |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for full timeline.

**Price impact**: Dysprosium oxide prices outside China spiked. European prices reached 6x Chinese domestic.

---

## Why no alternatives

| Attempted substitute | Problem |
|---------------------|---------|
| Terbium | Also 99% China-controlled |
| Different motor design | Performance/range penalty |
| Lower operating temp | Not feasible for EVs |
| Recycling | <1% of magnets recycled today |

**Fundamental constraint**: No other element has dysprosium's electron configuration. This is physics, not engineering.

## Who's exposed

**Most vulnerable:**
- [[Tesla]], [[GM]] — EV motors
- [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Anduril]] — defense systems (now blocked entirely)
- European automakers — no domestic supply

**Relatively advantaged:**
- [[BYD]] — Chinese, domestic supply access
- Companies reducing Dy content per motor

---

## Investment implications

**At risk:**
- Any EV manufacturer outside China
- Defense contractors (blocked from Chinese supply)
- Wind turbine manufacturers

**Potential beneficiaries:**
- Non-China Dy sources (rare, small)
- Magnet recycling technology
- Motor designs minimizing Dy
- Chinese EV/magnet companies (cost advantage)

---

## What to watch

- [ ] Myanmar production stability (conflict zone)
- [ ] Australia/US separation capacity buildouts (10+ years)
- [ ] Dy content reduction in next-gen EV motors
- [ ] Strategic stockpile levels (US, EU, Japan)
- [ ] China domestic vs export pricing spread
