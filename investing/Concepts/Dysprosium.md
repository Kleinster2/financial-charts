**Dysprosium** — The most strategically constrained rare earth element. Enables permanent magnets to function at high temperatures. 99% [[China]]-controlled. No substitutes.

---

## Why dysprosium is the chokepoint

| Property | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| 99% [[China]] control | Near-total monopoly |
| No substitutes | Can't engineer around it |
| Essential for EVs | Motors run at 150-180°C |
| Essential for defense | Precision-guided systems |
| Low volume, high impact | 20-60g per EV, but irreplaceable |

**The physics**: Dysprosium's f¹⁰ electron configuration allows it to maintain magnetic properties at high temperatures. This is a fundamental atomic property — no other element replicates it.

---

## The temperature problem

NdFeB magnets (neodymium-iron-boron) are the strongest permanent magnets. But they weaken with heat:

| Dy content | Strength loss at 150°C |
|------------|------------------------|
| 0% | 50% loss |
| 6% | 15% loss |

EV traction motors operate at 150-180°C. Without dysprosium, the magnets fail.

**No workaround**: You can't cool the motor enough. You can't use weaker magnets (range/performance suffers). You need dysprosium.

## Supply chain

| Stage | [[China]] share | Non-[[China]] |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Mining | ~90% | Myanmar (conflict), minor others |
| Separation | ~99% | Virtually none |
| Magnet production | ~99% | [[Japan]] (tiny) |

**The separation bottleneck**: Heavy rare earths like Dy require specialized separation from ore. [[China]] has 99% of global capacity. Even ore mined elsewhere goes to [[China]] for processing.

---

## Demand by sector

| Application | Dy per unit | Growth driver |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| EV motors | 20-60g | [[EV transition]] |
| Wind turbines | 100-200g/MW | Clean energy |
| [[Defense]] systems | Varies | Geopolitical tension |
| Industrial motors | Varies | Efficiency mandates |
| **Semiconductor equipment** | Varies | High-NA EUV ramp |

### Semiconductor equipment angle

Dysprosium is used in precision magnets for [[ASML]] High-NA EUV lithography stages:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Wafer stage magnets | Ultra-precise positioning |
| Reticle stage magnets | Mask alignment |
| Actuators | Nanometer-scale motion control |

**The connection**: High-NA EUV enables [[1.4nm race]]. If [[China]] restricts Dy/Tb exports, it could bottleneck the very equipment needed for leading-edge chip manufacturing.

**REAlloys deal (Dec 2025)**: $21M SRC investment to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027 — specifically for semiconductor equipment magnets.

**EV math**: 80M vehicles/year × 40g average = 3,200 tonnes Dy demand from EVs alone. Global production: ~2,000 tonnes/year.

## 2025 export controls

[[China]] specifically targeted dysprosium in April 2025:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Apr 4, 2025 | Dy added to export license requirement |
| Oct 9, 2025 | Controls tightened further |
| Dec 1, 2025 | Military buyers denied entirely |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for full timeline.

**Price impact**: Dysprosium oxide prices outside [[China]] spiked. European prices reached 6x Chinese domestic.

---

## Why no alternatives

| Attempted substitute | Problem |
|---------------------|---------|
| [[Terbium]] | Also 99% [[China]]-controlled |
| Different motor design | Performance/range penalty |
| Lower operating temp | Not feasible for EVs |
| Recycling | <1% of magnets recycled today (but changing) |

**Fundamental constraint**: No other element has dysprosium's electron configuration. This is physics, not engineering.

## Recycling progress (Jan 2026)

**IonicRE + US Strategic Metals partnership:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Missouri, USA |
| Site | 1,800 acres, fully permitted |
| Technology | Hydro-metallurgical magnet recycling |
| Feedstock | End-of-life NdFeB and SmCo magnets |
| Status | Operational in [[UK]], US site in development |

**[[Target]] outputs:**

| Light rare earths | Heavy rare earths |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Neodymium (Nd) | **Dysprosium (Dy)** |
| Praseodymium (Pr) | [[Terbium]] (Tb) |
| — | Samarium (Sm) |
| — | Gadolinium (Gd) |
| — | Holmium (Ho) |

**Why recycling matters:**
- "Fastest and lowest-cost pathway to ex-[[China]] supply chain" — IonicRE
- 61% carbon reduction vs primary mining (peer-reviewed)
- Avoids [[China]]'s separation monopoly
- Circular economy model

**Key quote:** "Magnet recycling is the fastest and lowest-cost pathway to developing an ex-[[China]] rare earth supply chain in the United States."

**Watch for:** US/[[Australia]] critical minerals framework supporting projects like this.

## Who's exposed

**Most vulnerable:**
- [[Tesla]], [[GM]] — EV motors
- [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Anduril]] — defense systems (now blocked entirely)
- European automakers — no domestic supply

**Relatively advantaged:**
- [[BYD]] — Chinese, domestic supply access
- Companies reducing Dy content per motor

---

## Investment implications

**At risk:**
- Any EV manufacturer outside [[China]]
- [[Defense]] contractors (blocked from Chinese supply)
- Wind turbine manufacturers

**Potential beneficiaries:**
- Non-[[China]] Dy sources (rare, small)
- Magnet recycling technology
- Motor designs minimizing Dy
- Chinese EV/magnet companies (cost advantage)

## What to watch

- [ ] Myanmar production stability (conflict zone)
- [ ] [[Australia]]/US separation capacity buildouts (10+ years)
- [ ] Dy content reduction in next-gen EV motors
- [ ] Strategic stockpile levels (US, [[EU]], [[Japan]])
- [ ] [[China]] domestic vs export pricing spread
- [ ] IonicRE Missouri site progress (magnet recycling)
- [ ] REAlloys SRC-backed expansion (300% by 2027)
