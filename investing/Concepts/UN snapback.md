**UN snapback** — Mechanism under UNSC Resolution 2231 allowing automatic reimposition of UN sanctions on Iran without Security Council vote. Triggered by E3 ([[UK]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) in August 2025; sanctions reimposed September 27, 2025.

---

## What is snapback

A safeguard built into the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA):

```
Iran violates JCPOA commitments
    → Participant state notifies Security Council
        → 30 days to adopt resolution continuing sanctions relief
            → If no resolution passes → sanctions automatically reimpose
                → No veto possible (procedural, not substantive vote)
```

**Key design feature:** Bypasses [[Russia]]/[[China]] veto. If Council fails to act, sanctions snap back by default.

## 2025 activation timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Aug 28, 2025** | E3 ([[UK]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) formally notifies Security Council |
| Sep 2025 | Security Council vote on continuing sanctions relief |
| Sep 2025 | Vote fails: 9 against, 4 in favor, 2 abstentions |
| **Sep 27, 2025** | UN sanctions reimposed at 00:00 GMT |
| Oct 18, 2025 | Original JCPOA expiration date ([[China]]/[[Russia]] claim sanctions lifted permanently) |

---

## E3 justification

**Iran's nuclear violations (as of Sep 2025):**

| Metric | JCPOA limit | Actual |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Enriched uranium stockpile | 202.8 kg | 8,400+ kg (**41x limit**) |
| Enrichment level | 3.67% | Up to 60% |
| IAEA monitoring | Full access | Largely blocked |
| High-enriched uranium (HEU) | 0 | 10 "significant quantities" |

> "Iran holds a quantity of enriched uranium which is 48 times the JCPOA limit, with the stockpile entirely outside of IAEA monitoring." — IAEA report, Sep 4, 2025

---

## Security Council vote

**Draft resolution to continue sanctions relief:**

| Vote | Countries |
|------|-----------|
| **Against (9)** | Denmark, [[France]], [[Greece]], Panama, [[Sierra]] Leone, Slovenia, Somalia, [[UK]], US |
| **In favor (4)** | Algeria, [[China]], Pakistan, [[Russia]] |
| **Abstain (2)** | [[Guyana]], South Korea |

**Result:** Resolution failed → sanctions snapped back automatically.

## What sanctions reimposed

Resolutions reinstated:
- 1696 (2006)
- 1737 (2006)
- 1747 (2007)
- 1803 (2008)
- 1835 (2008)
- 1929 (2010)

**Practical effects:**

| Category | Restriction |
|----------|-------------|
| Arms embargo | Full UN arms embargo restored |
| Ballistic missiles | Restrictions on missile technology |
| Nuclear-related | Enrichment, reprocessing bans |
| [[Travel]] bans | On designated individuals |
| Asset freezes | On designated entities |
| Financial | Banking restrictions |

## Disputed legality

**[[China]]/[[Russia]] position (Oct 2025 letter to UNSC):**

| Argument | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| E3 lacks standing | [[UK]]/[[France]]/[[Germany]] "ceased to perform" JCPOA commitments |
| Resolution 2231 expired | Oct 18, 2025 was natural termination date |
| Dispute resolution | E3 didn't exhaust JCPOA's internal procedures first |
| Permanent lift | Sanctions were permanently terminated, cannot snap back |

**E3/US position:**
- Snapback is self-executing by design
- Iran's violations are "clear factual evidence"
- Mechanism exists precisely for this situation

**Practical reality:** Western countries enforce reimposed sanctions; [[China]]/[[Russia]] ignore them.

## Impact on Iran

| Effect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Legitimacy** | US sanctions now backed by UN authority |
| **European companies** | Legally barred (not just cautious) |
| **[[Insurance]]/shipping** | New legal basis for restrictions |
| **Rial collapse** | Snapback was key accelerant (Sep-Dec 2025) |

**Before snapback:** US unilateral sanctions, EU cautious but legal
**After snapback:** Multilateral UN sanctions, EU legally bound

---

## Why E3 triggered it

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Iran breakout time | Estimated weeks, not months |
| HEU stockpile | Weapons-grade material accumulating |
| IAEA blocked | No monitoring of enrichment |
| Diplomacy exhausted | No progress in 2024-2025 talks |
| JCPOA expiring | Use it or lose it (Oct 18, 2025 deadline) |

---

## What didn't happen

| Feared outcome | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| [[Russia]]/[[China]] veto | Mechanism bypassed veto by design |
| Iran walks away | Already non-compliant |
| Immediate war | No military escalation from snapback itself |
| [[Oil]] supply shock | [[Shadow fleet]] continued operating |

---

## Investment implications

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Iran oil** | Additional legal barrier, but shadow fleet continues |
| **European exposure** | Companies now have UN legal prohibition |
| **Sanctions premium** | [[Oil]] prices incorporate Iran supply uncertainty |
| **Diplomacy dead** | No JCPOA revival possible |

---

## Historical context

**Previous snapback threat:**
- Trump administration attempted in 2020
- Disputed whether US had standing after withdrawing from JCPOA
- Most countries ignored 2020 attempt

**2025 difference:**
- E3 remained JCPOA participants
- Clear legal standing
- Actually implemented
