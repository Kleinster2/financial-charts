**Brazil Import Protectionism** — Brazil's persistent use of high import tariffs to protect domestic industry, creating a paradox where protection breeds the very weakness it tries to prevent. The Feb 2026 tariff hike on 1,000+ products is the latest example of a decades-old playbook.

## The paradox

```
High tariffs → domestic firms don't compete → industry atrophies
→ import penetration rises → government raises tariffs more
→ input costs rise → domestic firms less competitive → repeat
```

[[Brazil]] is one of the world's most closed major economies. Despite trade liberalization rhetoric, effective tariff protection remains high — and the Feb 2026 hike shows the instinct is to protect, not reform.

## Feb 2026 tariff hike

The federal government raised import tariffs on **1,000+ products** by up to **7.2 percentage points**:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Consumer electronics | Smartphones, LED/LCD panels, cameras |
| IT/telecom | Printed circuits, controllers |
| Industrial | Robots, automated printing machines |
| Medical | MRI, CT scanners, dental equipment, centrifuges |
| Capital goods | Industrial machinery |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Import growth since 2022 | +33.4% |
| Import penetration | >45% of domestic consumption |
| Top sources | US (34.7%), China (21.1%), Singapore (8.8%), France (8.6%) |

**Government justification (Ministério da Fazenda):**
- Imports at "levels that threaten to collapse links in the productive chain"
- Risk of "productive and technological regression"
- Aligned with international practice (anti-dumping, external shocks)

**Industry response (Fiorde Group):**
- Industrial park uses 20+ year old equipment
- Domestic capital goods industry can't meet demand
- "When costs rise abruptly, many projects are compromised" — Mauro Lourenço Dias

**Exception window:** Companies can request temporary zero-tariff through March 31 for previously exempted products.

**Political irony:** Brazil had been loudly criticizing [[Trump]]'s global tariffs while quietly raising its own. The US Supreme Court struck down Trump's tariff authority on Feb 20 — the same day this story broke.

## Historical context: the Custo Brasil trap

Brazilian consumers pay among the world's highest prices for electronics. An iPhone 17 in Brazil costs **more than double** the US price (2nd most expensive globally after Turkey). The tax/tariff stack:

| Layer | Approximate impact |
|-------|-------------------|
| Import tariff (II) | 10-20% (now higher after Feb 2026) |
| IPI (federal excise) | 10-15% |
| ICMS (state VAT) | 17-25% |
| PIS/COFINS (federal contributions) | 9-11% |
| Margin markups on tax base | Cascading |
| **Total effective tax burden** | **~60-100% on electronics** |

The [[Manaus Free Trade Zone]] was supposed to solve this — but it creates assembly jobs, not manufacturing. Components are still 100% imported, with minimal value-add or innovation.

## The deindustrialization feedback loop

Brazil's manufacturing share fell from **~30% of GDP (1985) to ~10% (2024)** — a "premature deindustrialization" that happened before the country got rich ($10K GDP/capita).

Protectionism's role in the decline:

| Phase | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| 1960s-1980s | Import substitution → built domestic industry but never competitive globally |
| 1990s | Partial liberalization → uncompetitive firms collapsed |
| 2000s | China WTO entry → flooded Brazilian market, destroyed remaining manufacturers |
| 2010s-2020s | Defensive tariffs → protected zombies, no new investment |
| 2026 | More tariffs → same playbook, same expected result |

The fundamental problem: **protection without export discipline** never forces firms to become competitive. Brazil protected firms that then never had to compete, so when exposed to global markets, they died. See [[Deindustrialization]].

## Investment implications

### Who gets hurt

| Actor | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Brazilian consumers | Higher electronics prices, less purchasing power |
| Brazilian manufacturers | Higher input costs (imported machinery, components) |
| [[Apple]] / [[Samsung]] | Higher retail prices in Brazil → lower unit sales |
| Hospital/healthcare sector | More expensive medical equipment maintenance |
| Infrastructure projects | Higher machinery costs |

### Who might benefit (short-term)

| Actor | How |
|-------|-----|
| [[Positivo Tecnologia]] | Domestic PC/electronics assembler — tariff wall helps |
| [[Intelbras]] | Domestic telecom/security equipment |
| Manaus assemblers | Protected from direct imports |

### Macro implications

- **Inflationary pressure** — government says "indirect and delayed," but capital goods costs flow through supply chains
- **Investment deterrent** — higher cost of modernization → slower productivity growth
- **Trade retaliation risk** — Brazil raising tariffs while criticizing US tariffs creates diplomatic tension
- **Tax reform interaction** — Brazil's consumption tax reform (CBS/IBS transition starting 2026) adds complexity on top of tariff changes

## Brazil vs. peers: trade openness

Brazil remains one of the most closed large economies:

| Country | Trade/GDP ratio | Avg tariff |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Brazil | ~30% | ~11% (MFN) |
| Mexico | ~80% | ~5% |
| Chile | ~55% | ~1% |
| India | ~45% | ~14% |
| China | ~35% | ~7% |

CDPP study (2025): Brazil's trade openness increased in recent years but remains far below comparable developing economies.
