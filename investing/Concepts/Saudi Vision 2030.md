Saudi Vision 2030 — Saudi Arabia's $7T+ economic transformation program launched in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Goal: diversify economy away from oil through mega-projects, tourism, entertainment, and tech.

---

## Core thesis

Saudi Arabia bets its future on a post-oil economy by 2030. The [[Saudi PIF]] is the execution vehicle—$940B sovereign fund deploying into mega-projects, tech, and global assets. The math: oil funds the transition, but fiscal breakeven oil price (~$96/bbl) creates a race against time.

## Key metrics (Jan 2026)

| Metric | 2016 baseline | Current | 2030 target |
|--------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Non-oil GDP share | ~50% | 76% | 80%+ |
| Non-oil revenue | $64B | $137B | — |
| Female workforce participation | 19.7% | 36.3% | 30% ✓ |
| Tourism contribution to GDP | 3% | ~8% | 10% |
| PIF AUM | $150B | $940B | $2T |
| FDI inflows (annual) | $7.5B | $26.5B | $19B ✓ |

Progress is real but uneven. Social targets (women's employment, entertainment) exceeded. Economic targets (FDI, diversification) mixed. Mega-project timelines slipping badly.

## The giga-projects

[[Saudi PIF]] owns and operates the flagship projects:

| Project | Budget | Status (Jan 2026) |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| [[NEOM]] / The Line | $500B | Suspended Sept 2025, pivoting to data centers. Only 2.4km of 170km by 2030. $8B writedown. |
| Qiddiya | $8B+ | Entertainment city, on track |
| Red Sea Global | $5B+ | Luxury tourism, operational |
| ROSHN | — | Real estate developer, active |
| Diriyah Gate | $20B | Historical tourism, under construction |

The Line reality check: Original plan called for 1.5M residents by 2030. Now targeting 300k. WSJ reported internal estimates of 2080 completion at $8.8T total cost. Sept 2025 suspension shifted focus to industrial/data center use.

## Fiscal math

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fiscal breakeven oil price | ~$96/bbl (IMF) |
| 2025 actual deficit | 5.3% of GDP (worse than 2.3% budget) |
| 2026 deficit target | 3.3% (Wall Street estimates higher) |
| 2026 financing needs | ~$58B |
| Public debt | 29.9% of GDP (rising) |
| Oil share of fiscal revenue | ~75% |
| 2025 GDP growth | Fastest in 3 years (OPEC+ supply policy) |

The paradox: Vision 2030 aims to reduce oil dependence, but oil prices must stay high to fund the transition. At $70-80 oil, deficits widen and project timelines slip further. Budget deficits every year since 2022 — officials call sustained shortfalls a deliberate choice to support investment.

Finance Minister Al-Jadaan (Feb 2026, AlUla Conference): Focal areas for next 5 years are tourism, manufacturing, logistics, and technology. Strategy update coming — discussing communication now but no release date. "We continue to reprioritize, rework our policies, making sure we enable the private sector to lead the economy."

Finance Minister Al-Jadaan (Dec 2025): "We have no ego—absolutely no ego. If we need to adjust, accelerate, defer, or cancel [projects], we will without blinking."

## What's working

Social transformation:
- Women driving (2018), working (36% participation)
- Entertainment (concerts, cinemas, sports leagues)
- Tourism visas (109M visitors by 2025)
- Quality of life improvements

Economic structure:
- Non-oil GDP at 76% (up from ~50%)
- Non-oil revenue doubled since 2016
- FDI exceeding targets
- Tech sector emerging ([[Aramco Digital]], [[Elm]])

---

## What's struggling

Mega-projects:
- The Line suspended, scope reduced 98%
- NEOM pivoting from utopia to data centers
- FIFA 2034 World Cup stadiums being scaled back
- Timelines pushed years/decades
- $50B+ already spent on NEOM with minimal output

Structural issues:
- Still 75% fiscal oil dependence
- Breakeven oil price rising, not falling
- Talent attraction difficult (human rights concerns)
- Execution capacity stretched thin

---

## AI pivot

As physical mega-projects stall, Saudi is pivoting to AI:

| Initiative | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Project Transcendence | $100B AI fund with [[a16z]] |
| Data centers | [[Google]], [[Oracle]], AWS building in-kingdom |
| NEOM data centers | The Line's new purpose—coastal location for cooling |
| Compute buildout | Massive GPU clusters planned |

AI may be more achievable than mirrored cities in the desert.

## Investment implications

Direct exposure:
- [[Saudi PIF]] investments (via stakes in [[Lucid]], [[SoftBank Vision Fund]], etc.)
- Contractors (engineering, construction, consulting)
- Tech suppliers ([[NVIDIA]], cloud providers)

Indirect signals:
- Oil price sensitivity—if Brent falls below $70, project cuts accelerate
- Debt issuance—Saudi tapping bond markets to fund deficits
- Competition with [[UAE]] for tech/AI leadership

Not investable: Most giga-projects are PIF-owned, not public.
