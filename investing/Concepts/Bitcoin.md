## How it works

**Proof-of-Work:** Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, validating transactions and securing the network. Winner gets block reward + fees.

**Fixed supply:** Hard cap of 21 million BTC. ~98% mined by 2030, final coin ~2140.

**Halvings:** Block reward cuts in half every ~4 years, reducing new supply:

| Halving | Date | Reward |
|---------|------|--------|
| Genesis | Jan 2009 | 50 BTC |
| 1st | Nov 2012 | 25 BTC |
| 2nd | Jul 2016 | 12.5 BTC |
| 3rd | May 2020 | 6.25 BTC |
| 4th | Apr 2024 | 3.125 BTC |
| 5th | ~Mar 2028 | 1.5625 BTC |

**Lightning Network:** Layer 2 for instant, low-fee payments. 15,000+ nodes, $200M+ capacity.

## Major holders

| Holder | BTC | % Supply |
|--------|-----|----------|
| [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] | ~1.1M | ~5% |
| [[BlackRock]] IBIT | ~771K | ~3.7% |
| MicroStrategy | 687K | ~3.3% |
| US Government | ~325K | ~1.5% |
| Grayscale GBTC | ~292K | ~1.4% |
| [[Binance]] | ~249K | ~1.2% |
| [[El Salvador]] | 7.5K | <0.1% |

**ETFs:** ~1.5M BTC held by ETFs/funds (7% of supply).

---

## ETF approval (Jan 2024)

**SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024** — ending a 10+ year battle (first filing: Winklevoss 2013).

| ETF | Issuer | AUM |
|-----|--------|-----|
| IBIT | [[BlackRock]] | Largest, 55% share |
| FBTC | [[Fidelity]] | #2 |
| GBTC | Grayscale | Converted from trust |
| ARKB | ARK/21Shares | |

**Impact:** $52B+ cumulative inflows to IBIT alone. ETFs absorbed more than annual mined supply.

---

## Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

[[Trump II]] administration established US [[Strategic Bitcoin Reserve]] via executive order (Mar 2025):

- **Goal:** Acquire 1M BTC (~5% of supply) over 5 years
- **Mechanism:** Treasury purchases + converting seized assets
- **Rationale:** Hedge against dollar debasement, counter China's gold/CBDC moves

See [[Strategic Bitcoin Reserve]] for details.

## Bull case

| Thesis | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Digital gold** | Fixed 21M supply, no counterparty risk, 15+ years uptime |
| **Institutional adoption** | ETFs, corporate treasuries, sovereign funds |
| **Halving dynamics** | Post-halving scarcity historically precedes rallies |
| **Macro hedge** | Alternative to $36T+ US debt / dollar debasement |
| **Network effect** | Largest hash rate ever (1.12B TH/s), most secure |

---

## Bear case

| Risk | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **Volatility** | 50%+ drawdowns routine ($126K → $82K in 4 months) |
| **No cash flow** | Pure speculation, no yield, no earnings |
| **Energy use** | ~212 TWh/year (~0.8% global electricity) |
| **Regulatory** | No comprehensive US framework |
| **Concentration** | ~5% held by unknown founder |
| **Technology** | Layer 1 scaling limits (~7 TPS) |

## Mining

**Current state (Jan 2026):**
- Hash rate: 1.12 billion TH/s (record)
- Energy: ~212 TWh/year
- Energy mix: 52% non-fossil (hydro, wind, nuclear, solar)
- Geography: US (38%), Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada
