**Venezuela repatriation strategy** — Trump administration plan to stabilize Venezuela post-Maduro to justify ending TPS and deporting 600K+ Venezuelans back. Oil rebuild and immigration enforcement as unified strategy.

## The Miller doctrine

Stephen Miller's immigration strategy aligns with Venezuela regime change:

```
Capture Maduro → Stabilize → "Safe country" → End TPS → Mass deportations
```

| Step | Status (Jan 2026) |
|------|-------------------|
| 1. Remove Maduro | ✅ Done (Jan 3) |
| 2. Install friendly government | 🔄 In progress |
| 3. Declare Venezuela "safe" | ⏳ Pending |
| 4. TPS termination justified | ⏳ Pending |
| 5. Deportation flights resume | 🔄 Ramping up |

## Immigration numbers

| Population | Count | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| TPS (2023 designation) | ~348,000 | Terminated April 2025 |
| TPS (2021 designation) | ~268,000 | Terminated November 2025 |
| Other undocumented | ~100,000+ | No status |
| **Total deportable** | **~600,000+** | In limbo |

## Policy timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2021 | Biden grants TPS to Venezuelans |
| 2023 | Biden expands TPS (348K more) |
| April 2025 | Trump terminates 2023 TPS |
| November 2025 | Trump terminates 2021 TPS |
| January 3, 2026 | US captures Maduro |
| January 6, 2026 | DHS confirms deportation policy "unchanged" |
| January 2026 | ICE: deportation flights to Venezuela "ramping up" |

## The coalition

**Drivers vs. beneficiaries:**

| Actor | Role | Motivation |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Marco Rubio** (State) | **Driver** | Cut [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] — Havana's lifeline |
| **Stephen Miller** (WH) | **Driver** | Create deportation pathway for 600K |
| **Oil lobby** | **Reluctant** | Skeptical, want rule of law first — pulled not pushing |
| **Trump** | **Enabler** | Optics, coalition management |

**Key insight:** Oil companies did NOT push for this. At [[WH oil executives Venezuela meeting 2026-01-09]], industry expressed deep skepticism. They're reluctant beneficiaries, not advocates.

**Rubio's real target:** Cuba. Venezuela is Havana's economic lifeline. Caracas falls → Cuba starves. See [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]].

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Marco Rubio** | Secretary of State, regime change driver |
| **Stephen Miller** | Immigration policy architect |
| **Kristi Noem** | DHS Secretary, executing deportations |
| **Tom Homan** | Border czar |
| [[US Government]] | Policy driver |

## Venezuelan-American reaction

**Doral, FL** ("Doralzuela") — largest US Venezuelan community:

- **Initial:** Celebration, dancing, tears of joy at Maduro capture
- **Then:** Fear as deportation policy unchanged
- **Concern:** Same people who fled dictatorship now deportable

**Advocate argument:** "Venezuelans here fled the dictatorship — they're not Tren de Aragua"

**Administration response:** Doesn't matter — Venezuela now "safe" to return.

## Implications

### For Venezuelans in US

- 600K+ face deportation
- No asylum path (travel ban, USCIS pause)
- "Safe country" designation removes legal arguments

### For Venezuela

- Returnee labor pool for oil rebuild
- Population repatriation after 7M+ fled under Maduro
- Social integration challenges

### Political

- South Florida Venezuelan vote helped Trump win
- Same community now targeted for deportation
- Tension between anti-Maduro and anti-immigration wings resolved by this strategy
