**SaaS** — Software as a Service. A delivery and pricing model where software is hosted centrally and sold as a subscription rather than a perpetual license. The defining characteristic is recurring revenue — which drives premium valuations, predictable cash flows, and high switching costs.

## Why SaaS commands premium valuations

Recurring revenue changes the economics of software:

| Property | Perpetual license | SaaS subscription |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Revenue recognition | Upfront lump sum | Spread over contract |
| Customer relationship | Ends at sale | Continuous |
| Switching costs | Low (own the software) | High (data, workflows, integrations) |
| Gross margins | 50-70% | 75-85% |
| Expansion revenue | Requires new sale | Upsell within account (NRR) |
| Typical EV/Revenue | 1-3x | 5-15x |

The valuation premium exists because a SaaS company with 120% NRR grows even if it signs zero new customers. See [[Cloud vs on-premise valuation]] for the full framework.

## AI disruption risk (Feb 2026 repricing)

The market is repricing which SaaS categories survive AI agents:

- AI-native revenue becoming material ([[Datadog]] 11%+)
- Agents replacing traditional workflows — [[Anthropic]] and [[OpenAI]] repositioned as general-purpose agent platforms
- Feb 2026 selloff: large-cap SaaS -25% to -40% YTD, workflow tools (MNDY, BRZE) -49% to -51%, while SPY flat
- Financial Times framework: non-essential workflow SaaS (highest risk) vs systems of record (medium) vs agent infrastructure (beneficiary)
- See [[SaaS stock meltdown 2026]] for full data and charts

## China structural differences

China's SaaS market operates under fundamentally different dynamics:

- Cheap engineering talent inverts build-vs-buy — in the US, a $50/seat/month SaaS tool beats diverting a $200K/year engineer to build internally; in China, large enterprises (especially SOEs) maintain huge IT departments that build custom solutions for less than the subscription would cost
- Lower ARPUs — the build-vs-buy inversion means SaaS vendors can't charge US-level prices even though their own labor costs are also lower
- Platform bundling — [[WeChat]]/[[DingTalk]]/[[Feishu]] bundle SaaS-like tools for free, compressing standalone TAM
- Government/SOE customers dominate enterprise spend, creating lumpy, relationship-driven sales cycles
- [[Xinchuang]] (foreign software replacement mandate) creates captive demand for domestic vendors through 2027
- Nearly all Chinese SaaS companies hit profitability inflection in 2025-2026 after years of cloud transition losses
- Key players: [[Kingdee International]], [[Yonyou Network]], [[Kingsoft Office]], [[Glodon]], [[Beisen]], [[Ming Yuan Cloud]], [[Weimob]], [[Youzan]], [[Sangfor Technologies]]

---

## Investment themes

- Vertical SaaS — industry-specific solutions with higher switching costs and deeper workflow integration
- Consolidation — platform expansion ([[Salesforce]], [[ServiceNow]]), tuck-in acquisitions for AI, vertical roll-ups
- Multi-cloud — enterprise flexibility demands, vendor diversification

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| AI disruption | Agents commoditize workflow tools |
| Macro sensitivity | Enterprise spending cuts hit discretionary SaaS first |
| Valuation compression | Rising rates reduce NPV of future cash flows |
| Hyperscaler bundling | [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon]] bundle SaaS features into platform |
| Customer budget fatigue | 112 apps per org is unsustainable |
