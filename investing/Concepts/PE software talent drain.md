# PE software talent drain

PE-owned tech companies structurally cannot compete for talent against public tech companies. The gap is compensation mechanics: public companies offer liquid RSUs that vest quarterly, are easy to value, and qualify for capital gains treatment. PE-owned companies offer phantom equity, profits interests, and co-invest — all illiquid, hard to value, taxed as ordinary income, and dependent on an exit event 3-7 years away.

This was always a drag. In 2026 it became existential: the [[AI disintermediation|SaaSpocalypse]] exposed $440B in PE software acquisitions to AI disruption risk, and the companies least able to respond are the ones that lost their best engineers to public competitors.

## The incentive cliff

When PE takes a public company private, existing RSU grants get cashed out at the deal price. Employees receive a lump sum and lose all forward-looking equity incentive. The replacement package is worse in every dimension:

| Dimension | Public RSUs | PE replacement equity |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| Liquidity | Sell on any trading day | Wait for exit (3-7 years) |
| Valuation | Market price, transparent | Opaque, board-determined |
| Tax treatment | Capital gains (if held) | Ordinary income |
| Vesting | Quarterly, continuous | New cliff (typically 1 year) |
| Downside protection | Always worth something if stock > $0 | Worth zero if no exit or MOIC hurdle missed |
| Personal capital required | None | Co-invest common |

The cliff creates a window of maximum flight risk right after the deal closes — employees have cash in hand from RSU acceleration and no compelling reason to stay.

## What PE offers instead

| Mechanism | Usage | Problem |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Phantom equity / synthetic equity | 47% of PE firms | Taxed as ordinary income, no real ownership, exit-dependent |
| Profits interests (PIUs) | Majority of PE-backed LLC grants since 2024 | 61% have performance conditions tied to MOIC/IRR; 21% require a sale event |
| Co-investment | Common for senior management | Requires personal capital, concentrated illiquid risk |
| Rollover equity | At acquisition | Becomes illiquid, hard to value |
| Cash retention bonuses | Universal | Cannot replicate wealth-creation potential of public stock |

Public tech company CEOs earn 6.93x more than private counterparts, driven almost entirely by equity.

## The body count

| Company | PE buyer | Deal | What happened |
|---------|----------|------|---------------|
| [[Cloud Software Group]] (Citrix + TIBCO) | [[Vista Equity Partners]] / [[Elliott Management]] | $16.5B | Three consecutive January layoffs. Glassdoor: private stock is "a joke," "all the talent has been laid off or quit." CEO (ex-[[Broadcom]] CFO) focused on cost extraction. Prices raised 30-40% while cutting staff. |
| [[Zendesk]] | [[Hellman & Friedman]] / [[Permira]] | $10.2B | All three Danish founders departed. Benefits gutted. PE placed its own retiring talent partner as CPO. No equity refreshes, nationalized salary bands. |
| [[Cloudera]] | [[KKR]] / [[Clayton Dubilier & Rice]] | $5.3B | Equity grants "an absolute joke." "Lot of people fed up with execs and actively looking to leave." PE promised not to change anything — "100% false." |
| [[Informatica]] | [[Permira]] / [[CPP Investments]] | $5.3B | ~1,000 layoffs in 2023, CFO departed, leadership churn. Eventually sold to [[Salesforce]] for $8B in 2025. |
| [[Dell]] | [[Silver Lake]] | $24.9B | Voluntary separation "so exceeded expectations" Dell may have had to re-hire. Inability to offer public stock drove Dell's return to public markets in 2018. |
| [[Squarespace]] | [[Permira]] | $7.2B | Employee anxiety post-acquisition. Ancestry (also Permira) precedent: layoffs, private shares not retained on termination. |

## The data

[[Revelio Labs]] research: PE acquisitions lead to higher attrition, lower pay, declining employee sentiment. The highest-paying roles see the largest attrition increase — precisely the talent PE most needs to keep.

NBER/CEPR: PE-owned companies eliminate jobs at ~2x the rate of comparable firms. Employment drops ~12% within two years of a buyout.

---

## PE firms' attempted fixes

### [[KKR]] — Ownership Works

Broad-based equity to 180K+ non-management employees across 75+ portfolio companies. Results at [[Ingersoll-Rand]]: quit rate dropped 90% over 10 years. [[C.H.I. Overhead Doors]]: average hourly worker received $175K payout, some got $800K. KKR earned 10x.

But: averages $3,562/employee across the program; employees who leave before exit get nothing. Proven in manufacturing/services — not yet proven for high-skill tech engineers with abundant outside options.

### [[Blackstone]] — broad-based ownership (since May 2024)

Equity distribution at all future acquisitions. Launched with ~18K employees at Copeland ($14B deal). 250+ portfolio companies, ~700K employees. Same limitation: payouts only at exit.

### [[Vista Equity Partners]] — replace, don't hire

Rather than competing for AI talent, Vista plans to cut its own workforce by a third using AI. Scoring portfolio companies on AI adoption. Avoids the talent competition problem but doesn't work for companies that need to build AI products, not just use AI tools.

### [[Thoma Bravo]] — domain knowledge over engineering

Orlando Bravo: "Software is not about the code or the technology — software is about domain knowledge." Positions portfolio companies as AI consumers rather than AI builders. Retains existing leadership (SailPoint co-founder stayed through multiple ownership transitions). Spends up to 18 months preparing for re-IPO, giving employees a clearer liquidity path.

## The AI accelerant

AI specialists command $206K average salary (56-67% premium over non-AI roles). Top packages exceed $1M at [[Meta]], [[Google]], [[OpenAI]]. Some early-career researchers offered packages rivaling professional athletes.

PE-owned tech companies are structurally disadvantaged:
1. Cannot match Big Tech equity packages
2. Cannot match startup equity upside ($2-4M grants for senior AI hires at Series D)
3. Margin-improvement mandates constrain compensation spend
4. Lack brand recognition among AI researchers
5. 6-7 month average AI hiring timeline vs PE's fast-moving value-creation timelines

The vicious cycle: can't hire AI talent → can't build AI capabilities → products commoditized → company less attractive → more talent leaves → further product deterioration.

---

## The $440B exposure

1,900+ software companies acquired by PE for $440B+ over 2015-2025. [[UBS]] estimates 25-35% of private credit market exposed to AI disruption risk. Isaac Kim ([[Lightspeed Venture Partners]], formerly [[Elliott Management]]): "Technology private equity, in its current form, is dead."

Already distressed: [[McAfee]] bonds ([[Advent International]] / [[Permira]]), [[ION Group]] bonds, KronosNet and Foundever debt at distressed levels. [[CVC Capital Partners]] took control of Sabio Group after previous owner couldn't find a buyer.

## Connection to ALTM selloff

The [[Alternative asset managers basket|ALTM]] selloff during the [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] Wave 1 (Feb 3-5) was not just beta — it reflected the market pricing PE software portfolio risk into alt manager equity. [[Ares Management]] (-16.8%), [[KKR]] (-13.3%), [[Blue Owl]] (-13.3%), [[Blackstone]] (-10.2%) all fell far more than the S&P 500 (-2.6%). The talent drain is the transmission mechanism: AI disrupts the product → PE can't hire talent to respond → portfolio companies deteriorate → PE equity reprices.

## Counter-thesis

- KKR and Blackstone ownership programs may actually work at scale — Ingersoll-Rand's 90% quit rate reduction is dramatic
- PE operational discipline (Vista's playbook, Thoma Bravo's domain focus) may matter more than raw engineering talent in mature software
- Regulatory and enterprise switching costs buy time — large corporations change vendors slowly
- PE firms are themselves deploying AI to reduce dependence on scarce human capital
- The best PE-owned companies (SailPoint under Thoma Bravo: $600M ARR, 50%+ SaaS growth) show the model can work
