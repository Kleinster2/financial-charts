## Bull case for international

| **Valuation** | 35% discount to US, near historic wides |
| **Dollar** | USD weakness = tailwind for USD-based investors |
| **Mean reversion** | Leadership rotates over decades |
| **[[Europe]] recovery** | German fiscal stimulus, defense spending |
| **Japan revival** | Corporate reform, BoJ normalization |
| **Diversification** | Concentrated US tech risk |

## Bear case (why US keeps winning)

| **Tech moat** | AI/cloud = US companies |
| **Demographics** | [[Europe]]/Japan aging faster |
| **Regulation** | EU less business-friendly |
| **Energy** | [[Europe]] energy costs higher |
| **Growth** | US GDP growth consistently higher |

"Cheap for a reason" argument.

## Key drivers

| Driver | Impact |

| **Risk appetite** | Risk-on can favor international |
| **Sector composition** | EFA = value-heavy, less tech |
