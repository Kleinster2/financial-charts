# Middle Class Decline

**The hollowing out of America's economic center** — the share of Americans in middle-income households fell from 61% (1971) to 50% (2023). Rising costs outpaced wages, creating a "barbell economy" where luxury and discount thrive while the middle disappears.

## The numbers

### Share of population by income tier

| Tier | 1971 | 2023 | Change |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Upper income | 11% | 19% | +8pp |
| **Middle income** | **61%** | **50%** | **-11pp** |
| Lower income | 27% | 30% | +3pp |

*Source: Pew Research Center*

**Polarization:** People moved to both extremes — more upper-income households (+8pp) but also more lower-income (+3pp). The middle shrank.

### Income trends

| Metric | 2000 | 2019 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Middle-class wage income | — | — | **-7%** (real) |
| Middle-class household income | $67,044 | $72,868 | +9% |
| Government transfers share | 18% | 28% | +10pp |

**The paradox:** Wages fell 7%, but total income rose — entirely because government transfers (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP) filled the gap.

### Wealth destruction

| Metric | 2000 | 2010 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Middle-income median wealth | $129,582 | $93,150 | **-28%** |
| Upper-income median wealth | — | — | Unchanged |

The 2000s were a "lost decade" for middle-class wealth — housing crash wiped out primary asset.

## The causes

### 1. Wage stagnation

| Period | Top 20% income growth | Middle 60% income growth |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1979-2012 | +42.6% | **+9.5%** |

Most income growth for middle-class families came from:
- Women entering workforce (more earners per household)
- Working more hours (not higher wages per hour)

### 2. Cost explosion in essentials

| Category | vs. Middle-class income |
|----------|------------------------|
| **[[Housing]]** | Rose faster |
| **[[Healthcare]]** | Rose faster |
| **Education** | Rose faster |
| Transportation | Rose slower |
| Food | Rose slower |
| Recreation | Rose slower |

The things you *must* buy got more expensive. The things you *want* to buy got cheaper.

**[[Housing]] crisis:**
- Median home requires $126,670 annual income to afford
- 75% of homes out of reach for middle-income buyers
- Median first-time buyer age: 40 (up from 31 a decade ago)

### 3. Manufacturing job loss

| Period | Manufacturing jobs lost |
|--------|------------------------|
| 2000-2010 | **5.7 million** |

These were the jobs that built the middle class — high school graduates could work in factories, earn good wages, buy houses, raise families. Those pathways closed.

### 4. Structural factors

- Technological change (automation)
- Globalization (offshoring)
- Decline of unions
- Eroding minimum wage value
- [[Trade]] policy choices

## The retail bifurcation

**"The rise of the department store symbolized the rise of the middle class. Its collapse mirrors the hollowing out of the same."**

### The barbell market

| Segment | Performance | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **[[Luxury]]** | +8% sales | [[LVMH]], [[Kering]], [[Prada]] |
| **Middle** | **-2% sales** | [[Macy's]], JCPenney, [[Saks Global]] |
| **Discount** | +7% sales | Dollar General, [[Aldi]], [[TJX]] |

Consumers moved to extremes — premium/luxury or price/value. The middle got squeezed.

### Department store collapse

| Metric | Then | Now |
|--------|------|-----|
| Dept store share of retail (1990) | 14.5% | — |
| Dept store share of retail (2024) | — | **<1.8%** |
| Mall-based dept stores (2017-2023) | — | **-50%** |
| Sector employment (20 years) | — | **-40%** |

**The customer disappeared:** Department stores were built for middle-class shoppers. As that class shrank, so did their customer base.

### Winners and losers

**Thriving:**
- Dollar stores: "Fastest growing retail category in America"
- Dollar General: +1,000 stores in 2023
- [[Aldi]]: Fastest-growing grocery chain
- Off-price: [[TJX]], Ross, [[Burlington]]
- [[Luxury]]: [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] recovery

**Dying:**
- [[Saks Global]] → [[Saks bankruptcy]]
- JCPenney → Bankruptcy (2020), 850 → 650 stores
- Sears → 5 stores remain
- Macy's → Closing 150 stores (30% of fleet)

## The counterargument

**AEI perspective:** The middle class is shrinking because people are moving *up*, not down.

| Tier | 1979 | 2024 |
|------|------|------|
| Upper-middle class | 7% | **31%** |

**The nuance:** Both can be true — some moved up to upper-middle class, but those who stayed in the middle got squeezed harder. The "middle" became a less viable place to stay.

## Investment implications

### Long thesis

| Category | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Dollar stores** | Growing customer base, expansion runway |
| **Off-price retail** | [[TJX]], Ross serve value-conscious consumers |
| **[[Luxury]]** | Wealthy consumers resilient (top 19%) |
| **[[Healthcare]]** | Inelastic demand, pricing power |
| **Education** | Despite costs, still seen as pathway up |

### Short thesis

| Category | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Mid-tier department stores** | Customer base shrinking |
| **Middle-market brands** | [[Gap]], J.Crew, Bed Bath & Beyond casualties |
| **Mall [[REITs]]** | Anchor tenants closing |

### Structural trades

**Barbell positioning:**
- Long: Dollar Tree + LVMH
- Short: Macy's, Kohl's

The middle is where value goes to die.
