**State-business relations** — The spectrum of how governments and private enterprise interact. Ranges from arm's-length regulation to full state ownership. Understanding where a country/sector sits on this spectrum is critical for investment analysis.

## The spectrum

```
Laissez-faire ←──────────────────────────────────────→ State control

   │                    │                    │                    │
Free markets    Regulated markets    Industrial policy    State capitalism
   │                    │                    │                    │
 (US ideal)         (Most OECD)        (Taiwan, Korea)      (China, Gulf)
```

**Key insight:** The same mechanism (development bank, state contract, subsidy) can be legitimate policy or corrupt extraction. Context determines which.

## Types of interaction

### 1. Arm's-length regulation

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Role of state | Sets rules, enforces competition |
| Private sector | Operates freely within rules |
| State ownership | Minimal |
| Example | US (idealized), UK post-Thatcher |

**Investment implication:** Fundamentals-driven. Political risk lower (but not zero).

---

### 2. Industrial policy

State actively promotes sectors/firms it deems strategic.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Mechanisms | Subsidies, tax breaks, R&D funding, procurement, trade protection |
| Goal | Build national champions, strategic sectors |
| Can be legitimate | Taiwan → TSMC; Korea → Samsung; Airbus |
| Can be crony | BNDES → JBS; picking losers |

**Examples:**

| Country | Policy | Outcome |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Taiwan** | Semiconductor focus since 1980s | [[TSMC]] global leader |
| **Korea** | Chaebol development | Samsung, Hyundai |
| **France** | Airbus, nuclear | European champions |
| **China** | "Made in China 2025" | Mixed — some success, some waste |
| **Brazil** | BNDES "national champions" | Mixed → [[Lava Jato]] |

**The line:** Industrial policy becomes cronyism when selection is based on connections rather than merit, and when beneficiaries don't deliver.

---

### 3. Regulatory capture

Agencies meant to regulate industry instead serve it.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Mechanism | Revolving door, lobbying, information asymmetry |
| Result | Weak enforcement, favorable rules |
| Example | FAA/Boeing (737 MAX), pre-2008 bank regulators |

**Not always corrupt:** Sometimes regulators defer to industry expertise legitimately. Becomes capture when public interest is sacrificed.

See [[Banking concentration]] for how Brazilian banking regulation preserves oligopoly (capture without corruption).

---

### 4. Development banking

State-owned banks provide subsidized credit.

| Bank | Country | Character |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **KfW** | Germany | Generally effective — Mittelstand support |
| **CDB** | China | Industrial policy vehicle — mixed |
| **BNDES** | Brazil | Captured → [[Brazilian cronyism]] |
| **JBIC** | Japan | Export finance |

**The test:** Does lending follow economic logic or political logic? Are loans repaid?

---

### 5. State-owned enterprises (SOEs)

Government owns and operates firms directly.

| Type | Example | Character |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Strategic SOEs** | Saudi Aramco, Petrobras | National resources |
| **Infrastructure SOEs** | National railways, utilities | Natural monopolies |
| **Competitive SOEs** | Singapore Airlines, Temasek portfolio | State as shareholder |
| **Captured SOEs** | Petrobras (Lava Jato era) | Extraction vehicles |

**Investment implication:** SOEs can be investable (Aramco IPO, Singapore firms) but carry political risk. Minority shareholders subordinated to state interests.

---

### 6. State capitalism

State directs economy systematically while maintaining private ownership.

| Country | Model |
|---------|-------|
| **China** | Party controls "commanding heights"; private sector in "cage" |
| **Singapore** | Temasek/GIC as strategic investors |
| **Gulf states** | Royal family = state = economy |
| **Russia** | Siloviki control strategic sectors |

**Key risk:** Private wealth exists at state's pleasure. Jack Ma, Khodorkovsky showed limits.

---

### 7. Cronyism

Political connections determine business success. Extraction at public expense.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Mechanism | Licenses, contracts, loans flow to insiders |
| Result | Wealth transfer from public to connected |
| Vehicle | Banks, state contracts, SOEs, permits |
| Outcome | Insiders rich; institutions weakened |

**Sub-patterns:**
- [[Crony capitalism]] — the broad pattern
- [[Bank cronyism]] — banks as extraction vehicles
- [[Brazilian cronyism]] — democratic variant
- [[Iranian banking]] — authoritarian variant

**The distinction:** Industrial policy says "we'll help firms in sector X." Cronyism says "we'll help firms owned by person Y."

---

## How to assess

| Question | What it reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| How did this firm get its license/contract? | Merit or connection? |
| Who owns it? | Political family? State-linked? |
| Are competitors harassed? | Level playing field? |
| Do loans get repaid? | Economic or political lending? |
| What happens when patron loses power? | Political dependency? |
| Are regulators independent? | Capture risk? |
| Is there rule of law? | Contract enforcement? |

---

## Country positioning

| Country | Primary mode | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **US** | Arm's-length + some capture | Defense/pharma have policy elements |
| **Germany** | Regulated + industrial policy | KfW, Mittelstand support |
| **France** | Industrial policy + SOEs | Dirigisme tradition |
| **UK** | Arm's-length | Post-Thatcher |
| **Japan** | Industrial policy (fading) | MITI era over |
| **Korea** | Industrial policy + chaebols | Still conglomerate-driven |
| **Taiwan** | Industrial policy | [[TSMC]] as success |
| **China** | State capitalism | Party control |
| **Singapore** | State capitalism (benign) | Temasek model |
| **Gulf** | State capitalism + royal | Oil wealth, royal control |
| **Russia** | State capitalism + cronyism | Siloviki extraction |
| **Brazil** | Mixed + cronyism | Democratic but captured |
| **Iran** | Cronyism + sanctions | IRGC extraction |

---

## Investment implications

| Mode | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **Arm's-length** | Fundamentals matter most |
| **Industrial policy** | Identify which sectors favored; policy durability? |
| **Regulatory capture** | Incumbents protected; disruption risk lower |
| **State capitalism** | Political risk high; minority shareholder risk |
| **Cronyism** | Avoid or price in regime risk |

**The framework:** Before analyzing a company's fundamentals, understand where it sits in the state-business relationship. A "cheap" stock in a crony system may be cheap for good reason.
