#concept #technology #supply-chain

**Materials science** — the study of how atomic/molecular structure determines material properties. Underpins semiconductors, batteries, magnets, aerospace, and most deep tech. Often the bottleneck in technology roadmaps.

> **Key insight:** Software can iterate in days. Materials take decades. When a technology is "materials-limited," progress depends on chemistry breakthroughs, not engineering optimization.

## Why materials matter for investing

1. **Long development cycles** — 10-20 years from discovery to production
2. **Winner-take-most** — First to scale often dominates (see: [[TSMC]], [[Corning]])
3. **Supply chain concentration** — Often single-source or single-country
4. **Capex intensity** — Materials facilities cost billions
5. **Talent scarcity** — PhD-level expertise, aging workforce

## Key domains

### [[Semiconductors]]

The most advanced materials manufacturing on Earth.

| Material | Use | Key players |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Silicon wafers | Substrate | [[Shin-Etsu]], SUMCO, [[Siltronic]] |
| Photoresists | Patterning | JSR, TOK, [[Shin-Etsu]] |
| CMP slurries | Polishing | Cabot, CMC Materials |
| Specialty gases | Deposition, etch | [[Air Liquide]], Linde |

See [[Semiconductor Materials]] for deep dive.

**Frontier challenges:**
- EUV photoresists (metal oxide vs CAR)
- Low-k dielectrics for 2nm and beyond
- Backside power delivery materials
- Advanced packaging substrates

### [[Batteries]]

Energy density and cost improvements are materials problems.

| Material | Use | Key players |

- Sodium-ion (lithium alternative)
- Lithium metal anodes

See [[Battery technology]], [[Lithium]], [[EV supply chain]].

### Magnets & rare earths

Critical for EVs, wind turbines, defense.

| Material | Use | Key players |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Neodymium | Permanent magnets | China (~90%), MP Materials |
| [[Dysprosium]] | High-temp magnets | China dominant |
| Praseodymium | Magnet alloys | China dominant |
| Samarium-cobalt | [[Aerospace]] magnets | — |

**The China problem:** China controls ~60% of rare earth mining, ~90% of processing. Strategic vulnerability for US/[[EU]].

See [[MP Materials]], [[Rare earths]], [[China]].

### Wide bandgap semiconductors

Enabling power electronics and RF.

| Material | Properties | Applications |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Silicon carbide (SiC) | High voltage, high temp | EVs, industrial |
| [[Gallium]] nitride (GaN) | High frequency, efficiency | Chargers, RF, data centers |
| [[Gallium]] oxide | Ultra-wide bandgap | Early research |
| Diamond | Ultimate thermal | Far future |

**Key players:** Wolfspeed (SiC), Cree, ON Semi, [[Infineon]], [[STMicro]]

See [[Silicon carbide]], [[Gallium nitride]].

### Display materials

Enabling screens from phones to TVs.

| Material | Use | Key players |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| OLED emitters | Light emission | Universal Display (IP), [[Samsung]], LG |
| Quantum dots | Color enhancement | Nanosys, [[Samsung]] |
| Glass substrates | Panels | [[Corning]] (dominant) |
| Polarizers | Light filtering | Nitto Denko, LG Chem |

### Thermal management

Increasingly critical as chips run hotter.

| Material | Use | Thermal conductivity |
|----------|-----|---------------------|
| [[Copper]] | Heat spreaders | 400 W/mK |
| Aluminum | Heat sinks | 200 W/mK |
| Graphite sheets | Phones, laptops | 1,500 W/mK (in-plane) |
| Diamond | Future | 2,000 W/mK |
| Vapor chambers | High-power | Varies |

**AI relevance:** GPU/AI chip cooling is a materials problem. See [[NVIDIA]], [[Advanced packaging]].

### Structural materials

[[Aerospace]], defense, infrastructure.

| Material | Properties | Applications |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Carbon fiber | Light, strong | [[Aerospace]], EVs |
| Titanium | Strong, corrosion-resistant | [[Aerospace]], medical |
| Advanced alloys | High-temp performance | Jet engines |
| Composites | Tailored properties | Wind blades, aircraft |

## Investment frameworks

### The materials bottleneck pattern

When demand outstrips materials supply:
1. Prices spike (see: lithium 2021-2022, palladium 2022)
2. Substitution R&D accelerates
3. New supply comes online (2-5 year lag)
4. Prices crash
5. Marginal producers exit

**Implication:** Materials are cyclical. Time entries carefully.

### Japan/[[Germany]] materials dominance

Critical materials often controlled by Japan or [[Germany]]:
- Photoresists: Japan (JSR, TOK)
- Wafers: Japan ([[Shin-Etsu]], SUMCO)
- Specialty chemicals: [[Germany]] (BASF, [[Merck KGaA]])
- Gases: [[France]]/[[Germany]] ([[Air Liquide]], Linde)

Less visible than chip fabs but equally strategic.

### China supply chain risk

China dominates processing for:
- Rare earths (~90%)
- Graphite (~70%)
- Lithium refining (~60%)
- Polysilicon (~80%)
- [[Gallium]]/germanium (~80%)

Export controls are a real risk. See [[China]], [[Export controls]].

## Materials as moats

Some materials create durable competitive advantages:

| Company | Material moat |
|---------|---------------|
| [[Corning]] | Gorilla Glass, fiber optics |
| Universal Display | OLED phosphorescent IP |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | Wafer quality, photoresists |
| [[3M]] | Diversified specialty materials |
| Applied Materials | Process knowledge |

**Pattern:** Deep materials expertise + manufacturing scale + customer lock-in = durable moat.
