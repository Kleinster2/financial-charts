**Weaponized antitrust** — Using competition/regulatory review as geopolitical leverage. Now bilateral: China blocks Western M&A, West seizes Chinese-owned assets.

---

## How it works

Global M&A requires approval from major markets:
- US (FTC/DOJ)
- EU (EC Competition)
- China (SAMR)
- Others (Korea, Japan, etc.)

Any major market can block by:
1. Formal rejection
2. Imposing unacceptable conditions
3. **Running out the clock** (China's preferred method)

---

## China's leverage

China market access = veto power over global deals

| Deal | Year | China action |
|------|------|--------------|
| [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]] | 2018 | Ran out clock |
| Nvidia-Arm | 2022 | Would have blocked (deal abandoned) |
| Intel-Tower | 2023 | Delayed, eventually cleared |

---

## Why it matters for semis

Semiconductor M&A must now consider:
- Will China approve?
- Can deal be structured to avoid China review?
- Is target's China exposure a liability?

This fragments the market and limits consolidation.

---

## Western response

### Defensive measures
- [[CHIPS Act]] reduces dependence on China market
- Outbound investment screening (proposed)
- "Friendshoring" supply chains

### Offensive measures (2025+)

The West escalated from blocking to seizing:

| Action | Year | Mechanism |
|--------|------|-----------|
| [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] | 2025 | 1952 Goods Availability Act |

This was the first nationalization of a Chinese-owned semiconductor company in Europe. The Netherlands used a Cold War-era law to take control of [[Nexperia]] from Wingtech, citing technology transfer concerns.

**Implications:**
- Precedent for future EU interventions
- China retaliated with export controls
- Escalation spiral risk

## Investment implications

- Large semiconductor M&A carries China approval risk
- Targets with China exposure less attractive
- Consolidation plays require geopolitical analysis
- Chinese ownership of Western assets now carries seizure risk
- See [[Export controls]] for technology restrictions
- See [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] for asset seizure precedent
