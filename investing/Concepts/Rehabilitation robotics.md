**Rehabilitation robotics** — Robots and exoskeletons that help patients recover motor function after stroke, spinal cord injury, or neurological conditions. A ~$1.5B market (2025) growing 17%+ annually.

---

## Why it matters

**The humanoid pipeline.** Companies like [[Fourier Intelligence]] built their humanoid expertise here — understanding human biomechanics, gait patterns, motor control, and safe human-robot interaction. This knowledge transfers directly to general-purpose humanoids.

**Scale of need:** 15M+ strokes globally per year. 52% of post-stroke patients are prescribed exoskeleton-based therapy. Aging populations in developed markets drive long-term demand.

## How it works

**Exoskeletons:** Wearable powered frames that move patient limbs through walking/reaching motions. Three approaches:
1. **Pre-programmed patterns** — Fixed gait cycles
2. **EMG-based** — Reads muscle signals, assists intended movement
3. **Brain-signal (Cyberdyne HAL)** — Detects motor intent from skin surface

**Gait trainers (Lokomat):** Patient suspended in harness over treadmill, robot guides legs through walking motion. Body weight support typically 30-50%.

**Key parameters:**
- Guidance force: 20-100% (how much robot assists)
- Training sessions: 8-60 per treatment cycle (median: 20)
- Speed: Start ~1 km/h, progress to ~3 km/h

---

## Clinical evidence

**Stroke rehabilitation:**
- Robot-assisted training shows "notable improvements in balance" vs conventional physical therapy
- Not definitively superior to manual therapy on all metrics
- **Key benefit:** Reduces therapist workload — one therapist can treat more patients
- Virtual reality integration improves outcomes

**Spinal cord injury:**
- ReWalk enables paraplegics to stand, walk, climb stairs
- FDA clearance for both hospital and home use

---

## Cost barrier

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Unit cost $70K-150K | Limits adoption to large hospitals |
| Reimbursement uncertain | Insurance coverage inconsistent |
| Training required | Specialist staff needed |
| Maintenance | Ongoing service costs |

**Trend:** Reimbursement improving — Lifeward reports growing insurance acceptance for ReWalk.

## Investment landscape

### Public companies

| Company | Ticker | Market cap | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| Cyberdyne | 7779.T | ~$1B | [[Japan]], HAL exoskeleton |
| Ekso Bionics | EKSO | ~$50M | US, small-cap |

### Private/recent funding

| Company | Round | Amount | Date |
|---------|-------|--------|------|
| Wandercraft | Series D | $75M | Jun 2025 |
| [[Fourier Intelligence]] | Series E | — | 2023-24 |

## Connection to humanoids

**Why rehab → humanoid works:**

| Skill | Rehab application | Humanoid application |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Biomechanics | Human gait modeling | Walking, balance |
| Motor control | Smooth joint actuation | Manipulation |
| Safety | Patient interaction | Human environments |
| Sensing | Force feedback, EMG | Tactile, proprioception |
| Compliance | Soft actuation | Safe collaboration |

[[Fourier Intelligence]] is the clearest example: 8 years of exoskeletons (2015-2023), then pivoted expertise to GR-series humanoids. Their "care-bot" positioning leverages healthcare relationships built through rehab business.

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Reimbursement** | Insurance coverage drives adoption |
| **Clinical evidence** | Needs stronger outcome data |
| **Cost** | Price must fall for broader adoption |
| **Competition** | [[China]] players entering with lower costs |
| **Manual therapy** | Cheaper alternative with similar outcomes |
