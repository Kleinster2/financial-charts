13F — quarterly SEC filing required of institutional investment managers exercising discretion over $100M+ in qualifying US-listed equity securities. Mandated by Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (enacted 1975). Primary tool for tracking hedge fund and institutional long positions, but does not capture short positions, derivatives notional, or non-US holdings.

## Filing requirements

| Requirement | Detail                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Threshold   | $100M+ in Section 13(f) securities                                                    |
| Frequency   | Quarterly (calendar quarters)                                                         |
| Deadline    | 45 days after quarter-end                                                             |
| Filed with  | [[SEC]] via [[EDGAR]]                                                                 |
| Who files   | Investment advisers, banks, insurance cos, broker-dealers, pension funds, hedge funds |

## What is disclosed

| Included | Not included |
|----------|-------------|
| US-listed equities (long) | Short positions |
| ETFs | Non-US securities |
| Share count and market value | Derivatives (except convertibles) |
| Put/call options on 13(f) securities | Fixed income |
| Voting authority | Cash, commodities, FX |

The asymmetry is important: a fund like [[Totem Point]] reports its $112M long book but not its short positions, giving an incomplete picture of its [[Long-short equity]] strategy.

## Timing and staleness

| Event | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| Quarter ends | Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31 |
| Filing deadline | ~Feb 14, May 15, Aug 14, Nov 14 |
| Public availability | Same day on EDGAR |
| Staleness | 45-135 days old by publication |

By the time a 13F is public, positions may have changed substantially. High-turnover funds' filings are least reliable as real-time signals.

## Use cases

- Tracking hedge fund conviction bets (top holdings, concentration)
- Identifying crowded trades (many funds in same stock)
- Monitoring institutional ownership changes quarter-over-quarter
- "Whale watching" — following large allocators like [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Bridgewater]]

---

## Limitations

- No short disclosure — only half the picture for L/S funds
- 45-day lag — stale by publication
- No position sizing context (leverage, gross/net exposure hidden)
- Confidential treatment requests can hide positions temporarily
- Penalties for late filing: up to $750K+

---

## Recent changes (2024)

- Rounding simplified to nearest dollar (previously nearest $1,000)
- Managers filing 13F must also file Form N-PX disclosing say-on-pay proxy votes
