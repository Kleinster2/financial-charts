US auto affordability — Structural rise in new-car prices squeezing US consumers. Average new car hit $50,326 in December 2025, up 61% since 2010. Affordability eroding: takes 36.2 weeks of household income to buy a new car (down from pandemic peak but above pre-Covid norm). Buyers earning <$75,000 increasingly priced out.

## Pricing trajectory

| Date | Average new car price | Source |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| 2010 | ~$31,250 (implied) | Edmunds |
| Pre-pandemic | ~$38,000 | Industry est. |
| Sep 2025 | $50,000+ (first time) | Kelley Blue Book |
| Dec 2025 | $50,326 | Kelley Blue Book |

US-made OEM average ([[GM]], [[Ford]], [[Stellantis]]): $54,380 — 13% above industry average (Edmunds).

## Affordability metrics

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Weeks of income to buy new car | 36.2 (end 2025) | Down from pandemic peak, above pre-Covid |
| 60-month auto loan rate | ~7% (start 2026) | Doubled from 2022 (~4%) to 2024 (~8%), ticking down |
| Auto insurance premiums | +65% (5-year) | Still rising |
| Repair costs | +44% (5-year) | Tech-driven — sensors, cameras, advanced materials |

Financing costs have more than doubled as a share of household income.

## Why prices rose — layered causes

### 1. SUV/truck shift (structural, pre-pandemic)

American consumers migrated from sedans to SUVs and pickups over two decades. Automakers leaned in:
- Killed affordable sedans (Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze)
- Engineered SUVs/trucks to ride like sedans
- Marketed safety advantages ("keep your family safe, you need all-wheel drive")
- Improved fuel efficiency on big vehicles — 1-in-5 Ford F-150s now hybrid
- Higher margins on larger vehicles drove OEM lineup decisions

### 2. Pandemic supply disruption (2020-2023)

- Chip shortages + raw material inflation (steel, aluminum)
- Production fell → inventories shrank → pricing power rose
- Automakers discovered high-margin, low-volume model was "crazily profitable"
- Incentives still below pre-pandemic levels (automakers hoarding margin)

### 3. EV price premium (2025)

- Average EV sells for ~$8,000 more than average car
- Q3 2025: EV share hit 10.6% (record), lifted by $7,500 federal tax credit expiry rush
- Q4 2025: EV share plummeted to 5.8% after credit expired Sep 30
- EV mix shift mechanically lifts average transaction price

### 4. Tariff effects (2025-2026)

- Automakers absorbing tariff costs to avoid sticker shock
- Spreading small increases across lineups rather than repricing individual models
- Partially offsets incentive increases

### 5. Regulation-driven improvements

- Rear-view cameras mandated (2018)
- Advanced metals for safety + weight reduction (fuel economy compliance)
- Lane-keep assist, blind spot detection becoming standard
- Infotainment screens, heated steering wheels moving from option to standard

## Who's priced out

| Income bracket | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| <$75,000/yr | Leaving new-car market |
| $75,000-$150,000 | Stretched — longer loans, higher payments |
| >$150,000 | Primary new-car buyer now |

Mix of buyers skewing more affluent. Sub-$75K households pushed to used market or no car.

---

## Policy responses

| Actor | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Republicans | Relax fuel economy rules, eliminate "vestigial regulations" (NHTSA head's term) |
| Democrats | Blame tariffs on imported cars/parts |
| Automakers | Seeking regulatory relief to build cheaper models |

NHTSA chief characterizing some safety regs as "outdated requirements that no longer advance safety goals" — potential for deregulation to reduce compliance costs.

---

## Globalization reversal

Pre-2020: automakers kept prices stable through globalizing supply chains — constantly shifting to lowest-cost labor. Two decades of increasingly better, safer cars without dramatic price change.

US now reversing this trend (reshoring, tariffs, friend-shoring). Removes the primary cost-control mechanism that kept prices flat for 20 years.

## Investment implications

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Sub-$75K buyers leaving | Used car market strengthening — [[DriveTime]], CarMax |
| Insurance +65% | Insurers benefiting, but claims costs rising too |
| Repair costs +44% | Aftermarket parts, repair chains benefiting |
| Deregulation push | Could lower OEM costs, improve margins if passed |
| Tariff absorption | Near-term margin pressure for OEMs with import exposure |
| EV share volatility | Without tax credits, EV demand fragile — watch policy |
