**Bank cronyism** — Using banks as extraction vehicles. Political insiders obtain banking licenses, attract deposits, lend to themselves, never repay, socialize losses. Distinct from [[Banking concentration]] (market structure) and broader [[Crony capitalism]] (banks are just one vehicle).

Sub-pattern of [[Crony capitalism]], which is itself one type of [[State-business relations]].

## Why banks?

Banks are the preferred extraction vehicle because:

| Advantage | How it enables extraction |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Deposit access** | Public savings = free capital |
| **Leverage** | Small equity controls large assets |
| **Opacity** | Loan books hard to scrutinize |
| **Central bank backstop** | Lender of last resort prints money to cover |
| **Deposit insurance** | Taxpayers absorb losses |
| **Regulatory capture** | Supervisors often from same elite |
| **Complexity** | Hard for outsiders to detect until collapse |

**The math:** A crony with $100M can control a $1B+ loan book, direct loans to himself, and walk away with the difference when the bank fails.

---

## The pattern

```
1. Obtain banking license (via political connections)
2. Attract deposits (high rates, prestige, convenience)
3. Lend to self/allies (shell companies, overvalued collateral)
4. Build illiquid assets (real estate, vanity projects)
5. Loans not repaid (political protection blocks enforcement)
6. Bank becomes insolvent (assets < liabilities)
7. Central bank/government absorbs losses
   - Print money → inflation destroys depositor value
   - Merge into state bank → taxpayers absorb
   - Deposit insurance payout → taxpayers absorb
8. Crony keeps the assets
```

**Key insight:** The extraction happens BEFORE the collapse. By the time a bank fails, the money is already gone.

## Case studies

### Iran — [[Ayandeh Bank]]

The clearest modern example.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founder | [[Ali Ansari]] |
| Ownership | ~65% via affiliates |
| Extracted | $1.21B in "loans" to shell companies |
| Depositors | 7 million |
| Deposits trapped | $2.34B |
| Capital adequacy at collapse | **-600%** |
| Resolution | Merged into Bank Melli (state) |

**Mechanism:** Ansari lent 90%+ of deposits to his own real estate projects (Iran Mall). When depositors wanted withdrawals, the bank had concrete, not cash. CBI printed money to cover → inflation → depositors lost via currency collapse.

**Political protection:** Connected to Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son). Criminal charges filed 2022 — escaped prosecution. UK sanctioned him; Iran didn't.

See [[Iranian banking]] for sector-wide capture.

### Brazil — Political family banks (1990s)

| Bank | Family | Political role | Collapse |
|------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Banco Econômico** | Calmon de Sá | Bahia senator | 1995 |
| **Banco Nacional** | Magalhães Pinto | Minas Gerais dynasty | 1995 |
| **Bamerindus** | Andrade Vieira | Senator, Ag Minister | 1997 |

**Pattern:** Regional political dynasties obtained banking licenses, lent to themselves and allies, collapsed when Real Plan stabilization exposed bad assets.

**Resolution:** Central Bank intervention, losses absorbed by deposit insurance (PROER program cost R$20B+).

### Brazil — Banco Santos (2004)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founder | Edemar Cid Ferreira |
| Scheme | Fraud, money laundering, political loans |
| Famous for | Art collection (later seized) |
| Outcome | Liquidated; founder jailed |

Classic crony banker — cultivated political connections while running fraud.

### Brazil — Banco Panamericano (2010)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Silvio Santos (media mogul) |
| Hole | R$4.3B in hidden losses |
| Resolution | Rescued by Caixa + FGC, sold to BTG |

**Why rescued (not liquidated)?** Silvio Santos's media empire (SBT) bought political goodwill. Too connected to fail.

### Brazil — [[Banco Master]] (2025)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Daniel Vorcaro |
| Scheme | High-yield CDBs (140%+ CDI), state bank bailout attempt |
| FGC payout | R$41B — largest in Brazilian history |
| Depositors | 1.6 million |
| Outcome | Liquidated; Vorcaro arrested fleeing to Malta |

**Most recent case.** Vorcaro built extensive political connections in Brasília. BRB (state bank) injected R$16.7B before Central Bank blocked acquisition. Supreme Court justices entangled — damaged institutional credibility, IMF raised concerns.

See [[Brazilian cronyism]] for full detail.

### Malaysia — 1MDB

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Vehicle | Sovereign wealth fund (not bank, but same pattern) |
| Extracted | $4.5B+ |
| Key figure | Jho Low |
| Political cover | PM Najib Razak |
| Resolution | Najib convicted (2022), Jho Low fugitive |

Used Goldman Sachs for bond issuance, then siphoned funds through layers of accounts. Same logic as bank cronyism: access to large capital pool + political protection + opacity.

### Russia — 1990s oligarch banks

| Bank | Oligarch | Mechanism |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Menatep** | Khodorkovsky | Loans-for-shares, Yukos |
| **SBS-Agro** | Smolensky | Depositor losses |
| **Inkombank** | Vinogradov | 1998 crisis collapse |
| Various | Various | GKO speculation, capital flight |

**Pattern:** Oligarchs obtained banks during privatization, used them to acquire industrial assets (loans-for-shares), speculated on government bonds (GKOs), fled when 1998 crisis hit.

**Resolution:** Depositors wiped out; oligarchs kept industrial assets. Some later expropriated by Putin (Khodorkovsky) — showing crony extraction can be reversed by the state.

## Red flags

| Signal | What it suggests |
|--------|------------------|
| Founder is largest borrower | Self-dealing |
| Related-party loans > 25% of book | Concentrated extraction |
| Real estate heavy loan book | Illiquid, overvalued collateral |
| Highest deposit rates in market | Ponzi dynamics — need new deposits to pay old |
| Rapid branch expansion | Land grab before collapse |
| Political family ownership | License obtained via connections |
| No foreign institutional investors | Smart money staying away |
| Auditor changes | Previous auditor saw too much |

---

## How losses are socialized

| Mechanism | Who pays | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Inflation** | Depositors (purchasing power) | Iran — CBI prints money |
| **Deposit insurance** | Taxpayers | Brazil — PROER, FGC |
| **Merge into state bank** | Taxpayers | Iran — Ayandeh → Bank Melli |
| **Bail-in** | Depositors (haircuts) | Cyprus 2013 |
| **Currency collapse** | Everyone holding currency | Iran 2025 |

**The crony wins either way:** Losses are socialized; gains were privatized.

## Bank cronyism vs banking concentration

| | Bank cronyism | [[Banking concentration]] |
|--|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Self-dealing, extraction | Market power, high spreads |
| **Legality** | Illegal (fraud, theft) | Legal (oligopoly) |
| **Who benefits** | Connected insiders | Bank shareholders |
| **Who loses** | Depositors, taxpayers | Borrowers (high rates) |
| **Bank survival** | Bank fails | Bank thrives |
| **Example** | [[Ayandeh Bank]] | Itaú (Brazil) |

Both are problems — but different problems requiring different solutions.

---

## Why it persists

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Information asymmetry** | Insiders know loan quality; outsiders don't |
| **Regulatory capture** | Supervisors from same elite, or bribed |
| **Political protection** | Prosecution blocked |
| **Moral hazard** | Deposit insurance = taxpayer backstop |
| **Short memories** | New depositors forget old collapses |
| **Complexity** | Hard to explain to public until too late |
