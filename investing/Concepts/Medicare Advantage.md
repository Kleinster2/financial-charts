**Medicare Advantage** — Private insurance alternative to traditional Medicare. Government-paid, privately-administered health plans for seniors. ~50% of Medicare beneficiaries now enrolled.

---

## Why Medicare Advantage matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Enrollment | ~35M seniors |
| Market penetration | ~50% of Medicare |
| 2026 total payments | ~$450B |
| Annual growth (historical) | 8-10% |

**The business model:** CMS pays insurers a capitated rate per member. Insurers profit by managing costs below that rate. Higher-risk patients = higher payments (risk adjustment).

## Key players

| Insurer | MA Enrollment | MA as % Revenue |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| [[UnitedHealth]] | #1 | ~30% |
| [[Humana]] | #2 | **~85%** |
| [[CVS Health]] (Aetna) | #3 | ~25% |
| [[Cigna]] | #4 | ~15% |
| [[Elevance Health]] | #5 | ~20% |

**Concentration risk:** [[Humana]] is a pure-play — most exposed to rate changes.

## Jan 27, 2026: Rate shock

CMS proposed **flat 0.09%** payment increase for 2027 — vs 5.06% for 2026. Analysts expected 4-6% to match medical inflation.

### Market impact

| Company | Drop | Market cap lost |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| [[UnitedHealth]] | -20% | ~$90B |
| [[Humana]] | -21% | ~$7B |
| [[CVS Health]] | -11% | ~$8B |
| [[Cigna]] | -8% | ~$8B |
| **Sector total** | — | **~$80B** |

Largest single-day wipeout in managed care history.

### What CMS changed

**1. Flat base rates**
Net average payment increase of 0.09% (~$700M total) vs 5.06% ($25B) for 2026.

**2. Chart review exclusion**
CMS will exclude patient diagnoses from chart mining that aren't linked to actual medical care. Eliminates incentive for insurers to retrospectively add diagnoses to inflate risk scores.

| Impact | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Rate reduction | -1.53 percentage points |
| Medicare savings | $7B+ in 2027 |

**3. V28 coding transition (final year)**
New diagnosis weighting system reduces payments. $6B hit to [[UnitedHealth]] alone ($2B UHC, $4B Optum).

### CMS Administrator: Dr. Mehmet Oz

Trump appointee leading cost containment push. Statement: proposal aims to "strengthen payment accuracy and modernize risk adjustment while protecting taxpayers."

### Industry response

AHIP (insurance lobby): proposal "could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors" when plans renew October 2026.

## Structural dynamics

### The risk adjustment game

Insurers are paid more for sicker patients. This created incentives to:
- Conduct "health risk assessments" to find diagnoses
- Mine medical charts for additional codes
- Code patients as sicker than they are

**GAO/OIG estimates:** Improper payments cost Medicare $12-25B annually.

The chart review rule change directly targets this.

### Medical cost inflation

| Year | Medical Benefit Ratio trend |
|------|----------------------------|
| 2023 | ~85% (healthy) |
| 2024 | ~88-90% (compressed) |
| 2025 | >90% for some (Aetna) |

Post-COVID utilization surge + labor costs + specialty drugs squeezing margins.

### From "defensive growth" to "policy cyclical"

For years, MA was considered defensive growth — aging demographics + consistent rate increases. The 2027 rate shock signals a regime change:

- Government now prioritizing cost containment
- Risk adjustment scrutiny intensifying
- Insurers becoming policy-sensitive cyclicals

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Aging population tailwind unchanged
- Survivors will consolidate share
- Cost discipline can restore margins
- Beaten-down valuations

**Bear case:**
- Multi-year rate pressure (not one-time)
- Chart review change is structural revenue loss
- Medical cost inflation ongoing
- Political scrutiny post-Thompson tragedy
- No near-term catalyst for re-rating
