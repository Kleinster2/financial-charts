# GS AI Productivity Beneficiaries (GSXUPROD)

[[Goldman Sachs]] thematic basket of non-tech companies poised to benefit from AI-driven labor productivity gains. Dubbed "the most important trade of 2026" by GS equity strategy (David Kostin, Ryan Hammond).

---

## Methodology

- **Universe:** Russell 1000
- **Screen:** Top 25% by share of wage costs subject to AI automation AND labor costs highest as share of sales
- **Filter:** Must have mentioned AI in context of productivity/efficiency on Q2 or Q3 2025 earnings calls
- **Excludes:** Tech and AI-native companies (this is the "Phase 3" beneficiary layer, not infrastructure)

**Thesis:** These companies' earnings will disproportionately benefit from AI adoption via labor cost reduction and margin expansion — the demand-side of the same disruption hitting [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD basket]] constituents on the supply side.

## Performance (as of Jan 2026)

| Metric | GSXUPROD | S&P 500 EW |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Return since Dec 2023 | +17% | +23% |
| EPS revision (2yr) | **+24%** | +15% |
| EPS outperformance | **+9pp** | — |

Stock gains lagging earnings growth → GS sees "attractive risk-reward for investors seeking to expand AI exposure beyond the infrastructure layer."

## Relationship to AIWD basket

| | GSXUPROD | [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] |
|--|---------|------|
| **Thesis** | AI adoption = lower costs, higher margins | AI adoption = revenue displacement |
| **Exposure** | Labor cost reduction (demand side) | Product substitution (supply side) |
| **Sector tilt** | Banks, logistics, restaurants, retail | Legal, data analytics, IT services, ad agencies |
| **Expected move on AI news** | ↑ (efficiency gains) | ↓ (disruption fears) |

Same underlying force (AI automating white-collar tasks), opposite sides of the trade. GSXUPROD companies *buy* the automation; AIWD companies *sell* what gets automated.
