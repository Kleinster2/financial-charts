**Private credit** — $1.7T market of non-bank lending to corporates. Direct loans, often to PE-backed companies. Historically safer than leveraged loans due to covenants and information access — but that's changing.

---

## Origins & growth

**History:** Traces to 1980s when insurance companies began lending directly to corporates.

**Post-2008 boom:** Regulators clamped down on risky bank lending → private credit filled the gap.

| Year | AUM | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| 2015 | $500B | Early growth |
| 2023 (Jun) | **$1.7T** | 3x growth in 8 years |
| 2028E | **$3.5T** | BlackRock forecast |

---

| **Information access** | Non-public financials from borrowers |
| **Relationship lending** | Direct line to management |
| **Early warning** | Covenant breach = intervention trigger |

**If borrower breaches covenants:**
- Demand equity injection from PE sponsor

## Covenant-lite creep (Jan 2026)

**Private credit firms adopting leveraged loan terms to win business:**

| Trend | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Cov-lite becoming common | Large borrowers pushing for and getting looser terms |
| 2026 acceleration expected | Lenders competing for deal flow |
| Middle-market spreading | No longer just mega-deals |

**Ben Davis (Eversheds Sutherland):** "In 2026 I expect some private credit lenders will increasingly agree to looser or no covenants in order to win business."

**Hadrien Servais (Simpson Thacher):** "Top-quality borrowers will command looser terms and or lower pricing."

---

## Recent cov-lite deals (Jan 2026)

| Deal | Sponsor | Lenders | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| **JTC Plc** | [[Permira]] + CPPIB | [[Blackstone]], CVC Credit, [[GIC]] | Corporate services |
| **The Key Group** | [[Permira]] | Goldman Sachs AM, Macquarie, Apax Credit | [[UK]] education software |
| **Global Gruppe** | — | Various | €1B cov-lite offers, sale on hold |

**Pattern:** Top-tier PE sponsors extracting cov-lite from major lenders.

---

## Middle-market CLO cov-lite limits

**Funds increasing allowable cov-lite exposure:**

| Year | Max cov-lite % |
|------|----------------|
| 2021 | 16% |
| 2025 Q1 | **25%** |

*Source: [[S&P Global]] Ratings*

Threshold reflects maximum allowed, not current exposure. But rising limits signal direction.

---

## [[Banks]] fighting back

**[[Banks]] re-entering the market:**
- Offering cheaper deals and fewer covenants
- Creating own private credit funds
- Advising clients on private credit

| Bank | Private credit activity |
|------|------------------------|
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | Own fund, advisory |
| Societe Generale | Own fund |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | Goldman Sachs AM |

**Dynamic:** Competition between banks and private credit may encourage riskier deals ([[Moody's]] warning).

## Retail investor expansion

**Targeting wealthy individuals (2022-2023):**

Private credit historically institutional-only. Now targeting high-net-worth individuals:

| Firm | Product | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | **BCRED** | $37.8B in ~1 year, non-traded BDC (US) |
| [[Blackstone]] | Luxembourg fund | First European wealthy individual fund (2022) |
| [[Apollo]] | European platform | Launching full suite for individuals |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | European fund | Retail client business focus |
| Arcmont | Exploring | European wealthy investors |

**Padideh Raphael (Goldman Sachs AM):** "Enabling individual investors to access the diversification and performance benefits of private markets is a major focus."

**Jim Zelter (Apollo co-president):** "We're launching our European product platform... designed to offer a full suite of options to individuals in [[Europe]]."

**Structures:**
- **BDCs (US)** — Business development companies, publicly traded closed-end funds
- **Non-traded BDCs** — Blackstone innovation, quarterly redemption option (5% cap)
- **Perpetual vehicles** — Ongoing vs fixed lock-up period

**BCRED risk:** Saw redemption spike late 2022 as recession/default fears hit. Quarterly redemption caps (5%) prevent runs but limit liquidity.

### The retail model breaks (Feb 2026)

The retail push hit its first real stress test — and the model failed.

**[[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] (Feb 19, 2026):** Blue Owl permanently halted quarterly redemptions at OBDC II, its retail-focused BDC. First major retail BDC to gate investors. The fund had promised quarterly 5% NAV liquidity for 8 years — until it couldn't.

**Industry-wide exodus:** BDCs with >$1B AUM saw **$2.9B in withdrawal requests in Q4 2025**, up **200% from Q3** (Robert A Stanger & Co.). Not a Blue Owl problem — a structural problem.

**The fundamental contradiction:**
- **What was sold:** "Bond-like yields (8-12%) with quarterly liquidity"
- **What exists:** Illiquid loans to middle-market companies that can't be sold quickly without losses
- **What happens under stress:** Honoring redemptions benefits early redeemers at remaining investors' expense → classic bank run dynamics → gate everyone equally

**Sequence at OBDC II:**
1. Redemption requests spike 20% YoY through 2025
2. Blue Owl tries to merge OBDC II into public BDC → would impose ~20% losses → abandoned
3. Blue Owl sells $1.4B in loans at 99.7% par to pension funds/insurers
4. Quarterly redemptions permanently ended → replaced by pro-rata distributions
5. OWL -8.7%, alt managers -4% to -6% across the board

**Craig Packer (Blue Owl co-President):** Framed it as accelerated capital return, not a halt. Returning 30% of capital at book value in 45 days. But the quarterly redemption window — the core retail selling point — is gone forever.

**The scale problem:** OBDC II is $1.7B. What happens when the $2.9B/quarter redemption pace hits:

| Fund | AUM | Manager | Status |
|------|-----|---------|--------|
| OBDC II | $1.7B | [[Blue Owl]] | **Gated** |
| OBDC | $16B+ | [[Blue Owl]] | Watching |
| ARCC | $26B+ | [[Ares Management]] | Largest BDC |
| BCRED | $50B+ | [[Blackstone]] | Largest non-traded |

**Regulatory response:** Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for increased bank capital requirements for private credit, greater data disclosure, and a stress test. If regulators act, the entire retail fundraising model gets constrained.

**Mohamed El-Erian:** *"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?"*

**The 2007 parallel:**

| 2007 | 2026 |
|------|------|
| Bear Stearns hedge funds gated | Blue Owl OBDC II gated |
| Subprime mortgage concentration | Software/tech loan concentration |
| CDOs with liquidity mismatch | Retail BDCs with liquidity mismatch |
| "Contained" narrative | "Finite-life wind-down" narrative |
| $10T mortgage market | $1.8T private credit market |

**Key difference:** Private credit is much smaller and better capitalized. But the pattern — opaque, concentrated, levered, with retail money in illiquid structures — rhymes.

**March 31 quarter-end is the next systemic test** — when redemption requests hit across all semi-liquid funds simultaneously.

## Investor risks

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Liquidity** | 5+ year lockups, no formal trading |
| **Secondaries discount** | Sales at substantial discount to NAV |
| **Transparency** | Fewer disclosure obligations than public markets |
| **Valuation** | No market → hard to value, quarterly at best |
| **PE linkage** | If PE shocks, private credit follows |

**Hurdle rate issue:** High yields during rate hikes blasted through hurdle rates → managers getting larger profit share → LPs pushing for higher thresholds.

---

## Valuation concerns

**[[UBS]] Chairman Colm Kelleher (late 2023):** Warning of "dangerous bubble" in private credit.

**Evidence of denial:**
- Some lenders barely altering book values despite borrower stress
- Quarterly valuations (varies by fund)
- Third-party valuers optional
- Unclear how far values would fall in recession

---

## Regulatory landscape

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **[[EU]]** | Caps on leverage, diversification requirements |
| **US SEC** | Rules for external audits struck down by federal court |
| **[[UK]] FCA** | Reviewing private market valuations |

**Key gap:** No widespread moves to regulate like deposit-taking banks. Governments see private credit as absorbing risk inappropriate for banks.

---

## Risk warnings

**Amin Doulai (King & Spalding):**
> "At the end of the day, nothing beats proper covenants and contractual protections when things get difficult. Some lenders will tell you that their fundamental protection is understanding the credit and maintaining the direct line into management teams. But when a company starts to underperform and it's defaulting on its loans, you'll find that the direct line isn't open anymore."

**Industry concern:**
- Looser terms storing up trouble
- Covenants = hedge against recession, tariffs
- Without covenants, lenders lose early intervention tools
- Good faith relationships fail under stress

---

## Recession resilience — unknown

**Fed (May 2023):** Not worried, but lack of transparency makes systemic risk hard to assess.

**Private credit argument:**
- Capital locked in longer than bank deposits
- Stronger underwriting standards
- Floating rates = yields adjust

**Reality:** No one knows. Industry untested through major recession since 2008 growth. Covenant-lite trend removes early warning tools.

---

## Holdouts

**Peter Lockhead (ICG):** "We are not afraid to walk away from deals where we are not comfortable with the documentation."

Some mid-market lenders still securing conventional covenants. But competitive pressure intensifying.

---

## Key players

### Lenders

| Firm | Focus |
|------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | Mega-deals, cov-lite participating |
| [[Blue Owl]] | Data center focus |
| [[HPS Investment Partners]] | Private credit leader |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Multi-strategy |
| Macquarie | Infrastructure, credit |
| CVC Credit | European strength |
| ICG | Middle-market, covenant discipline |
| Apax Credit | PE-adjacent |

### Sponsors (borrowers)

| Firm | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [[Permira]] | Negotiating cov-lite successfully |
| Major PE firms | Extracting terms as market power shifts |

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case for cov-lite:**
- Validates credit quality of borrowers
- Spreads remain attractive for risk taken
- Private credit funds gaining market share

**Bear case:**
- Eroding what made private credit "safer"
- Cycle-end behavior (reaching for yield)
- Stored-up losses when recession hits
- Recovery rates will suffer without covenant tools

---

## Software concentration risk (Feb 2026)

The biggest emerging risk in private credit — software/tech is now the largest sector concentration, and AI disruption threatens the underlying cash flows.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Software share of BDC investments | ~17% by deal count (#2 sector) | PitchBook |
| Software in speculative-grade credit | $597B-$681B (14-16%) | Deutsche Bank |
| Default rate — aggressive AI disruption | **13%** (vs 8% lev loans, 4% HY) | UBS |
| Software share of PIK loans | #1 sector | PitchBook LCD |

**The mechanism:** PE firms loaded up on software buyout debt since 2020 — attracted by recurring revenue, high margins, sticky customers. But AI (especially agentic AI) threatens to replicate what enterprise software charges for, weakening cash flows → defaults rise.

**Trigger (Feb 2026):** Anthropic's new AI tools sparked a software selloff. Private credit stocks followed: [[Ares Management]] -12%, [[Blue Owl]] -8%, [[KKR]] -10%, [[TPG]] -7%.

**Still lending:** Despite warnings, firms keep deploying — Blue Owl led $1.4B for OneStream (Hg buyout), Ares leading €1.4B for EG A/S (Scandinavian software). The incentive structures haven't changed.

**Jamie Dimon's "cockroaches"** (late 2025): Stress in one borrower signals more hidden trouble. Software PIK loans are the tell — borrowers deferring interest payments because cash flows aren't there.

**Kenny Tang (PitchBook LCD):** "AI disruption could be a credit risk for some Software & Services sector borrowers... depends on which ones are behind the AI curve and which ones are on top of it."

**Mark Zandi (Moody's):** "There will surely be significant credit problems... the private credit industry is probably currently able to absorb any losses reasonably well, this may not be the case a year from now if the current credit growth continues."

---

## For theses

- **Long private credit (HPS, Blue Owl)**: Growing market, but watch cov-lite exposure
- **Bear private credit**: Cycle-end behavior, losing structural advantages
- **Long PE sponsors**: Borrower power increasing, better financing terms
