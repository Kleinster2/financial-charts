# Separately Managed Accounts

An investment portfolio of individual securities owned directly by a single investor, managed by a professional asset manager according to a personalized mandate. The defining feature: you own the actual stocks and bonds, not shares in a pooled fund.

SMAs sit between DIY investing and mutual funds/ETFs — professional management with individual ownership. Historically reserved for ultra-high-net-worth investors ($1M+ minimums), the market has democratized significantly. Minimums now start as low as $5K-$100K depending on provider.

## How they work

1. Investor selects a strategy (e.g., US large-cap growth, municipal bonds, ESG equity)
2. A professional asset manager builds and manages a portfolio of individual securities in the investor's name
3. The investor directly owns every stock/bond — their name on the title, individual cost basis per holding
4. The manager has discretionary authority to trade within the agreed mandate
5. Customization requests (exclude certain stocks, tilt toward sectors, ESG screens) are negotiated upfront

The investor's account is "separate" — not commingled with other investors' money, unlike a mutual fund where everyone owns shares in the same pool.

## SMA vs. mutual fund vs. ETF

| Feature | SMA | Mutual fund | ETF |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----|
| Ownership | Direct (you own the securities) | Indirect (you own fund shares) | Indirect (you own fund shares) |
| Customization | High (exclude stocks, ESG screens, tax optimization) | None | None |
| Tax efficiency | Highest (individual tax-loss harvesting, no embedded gains) | Lowest (forced capital gains distributions) | Medium (in-kind creation/redemption avoids most distributions) |
| Transparency | Real-time holdings visibility | Delayed 30-60 days | Daily holdings |
| Minimums | $5K-$500K+ (varies by provider) | $500-$5,000 | Price of one share |
| Fees | 0.20%-0.70% management + advisory wrap (total 1-3%) | 0.03%-1.5% expense ratio | 0.03%-0.75% expense ratio |
| Liquidity | Can sell individual holdings intraday | Once-daily NAV | Intraday trading |
| Manager transition | Transfer securities in-kind (no forced sale) | Must liquidate | Must sell shares |

## The tax advantage (the real selling point)

Tax management is why SMAs exist for taxable accounts. The advantages compound over time:

### Tax-loss harvesting (TLH)
The manager continuously identifies securities that have declined and sells them to realize losses. These losses offset gains — either within the SMA or from other investments (real estate sales, stock options, etc.). In a mutual fund, TLH happens at the fund level and can't be tailored to your personal tax situation.

Example: You sell a rental property for a $100K capital gain. Your SMA manager harvests $100K in losses from underperforming positions in the portfolio, offsetting the tax liability entirely. This is impossible with a mutual fund.

### No embedded capital gains
Mutual fund investors inherit tax liabilities from other shareholders. If the fund manager sells appreciated securities (or other investors redeem shares, forcing sales), the resulting capital gains are distributed to all shareholders — even those who just bought in. You can literally buy a fund on Dec 1, receive a capital gains distribution on Dec 15, and owe taxes on gains you never benefited from.

SMAs eliminate this entirely. You only pay tax on gains realized in your specific account during your ownership.

### Lot-level control
When selling, the manager selects specific tax lots (highest cost basis first) to minimize realized gains. They can also defer selling appreciated positions to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

### In-kind transfers
You can fund an SMA with existing securities or move between managers without selling — avoiding capital gains triggers. Try doing that with a mutual fund.

### Charitable giving optimization
Donate the most highly appreciated individual securities to charity. Avoid capital gains tax and claim the full fair market value as a deduction.

## Direct indexing: the SMA revolution

Direct indexing is the fastest-growing segment of the SMA market. Instead of buying an [[S&P 500]] ETF, you own all ~500 individual stocks directly, weighted to track the index — but with the ability to:

- Harvest losses on individual names while maintaining index exposure (replace the sold stock with a correlated substitute)
- Exclude specific companies or sectors (employer stock, ESG screens, values-based exclusions)
- Tilt toward factors (value, momentum, quality) while staying close to benchmark

Direct indexing assets projected to reach $800B by 2026, growing at 12.3% CAGR (Cerulli Associates). This is the segment that's eating into passive ETF dominance for taxable accounts above $100K.

Key providers in direct indexing:
- [[Parametric]] (owned by [[Morgan Stanley]]) — largest, ~$400B+ in assets
- [[Fidelity]] (FidFolios) — minimum $5K, fractional shares
- [[Charles Schwab]] (Schwab Personalized Indexing) — 0.40% fee, drops to 0.35% above $2M
- [[Vanguard]] Personalized Indexing — launched 2023
- [[Wealthfront]], [[Betterment]] — robo-advisor implementations, lower minimums
- [[BlackRock]] (Aperio) — acquired 2021, institutional focus

## Market size and growth

| Year | SMA AUM | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2013 | $778B | Cerulli |
| 2020 | ~$1.5T | Cerulli |
| 2023 | $2.2T | Cerulli |
| 2025 | ~$3.9T | Natixis/Cerulli |
| 2026E | $3.6T-$5T+ | Cerulli / FUSE Research |

Expected 15%+ growth from 2025 to 2026. The wide range in estimates ($3.6T vs $5T+) reflects different definitions — some include all separately managed assets, others only traditional SMA wrappers.

Growth drivers:
- Tax-loss harvesting awareness increasing among advisors
- Technology reducing minimums (fractional shares enable $5K accounts)
- Fee compression making SMAs competitive with active mutual funds
- Generational wealth transfer creating taxable accounts that benefit from SMAs
- ESG/values-based investing demand (SMAs are the best vehicle for granular screens)

## Fee structure

Typical SMA fee layers:

| Component | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Management fee | 0.20%-0.50% | Paid to the asset manager for portfolio management |
| Advisory/platform fee | 0.25%-1.50% | Paid to the advisor/broker for account oversight |
| Total wrap fee | 1.0%-3.0% | All-in fee covering management, advisory, custody, trading |

For comparison:
- Passive ETF expense ratio: 0.03%-0.10%
- Active mutual fund expense ratio: 0.50%-1.50%
- Direct indexing SMA: 0.20%-0.40% (management only)

The total wrap fee makes SMAs look expensive vs. ETFs, but the tax alpha from TLH can easily exceed the fee differential for investors in high tax brackets with taxable accounts above $500K. Studies suggest TLH can add 1-2% per year in after-tax alpha, depending on market volatility and portfolio turnover.

## Who should use SMAs

Good fit:
- Taxable accounts above $100K+ (tax benefits scale with account size)
- High-income investors in top marginal brackets (TLH most valuable)
- Concentrated stock positions needing diversification (in-kind contribution)
- Values-based investors wanting granular ESG/SRI screens
- Investors transitioning between advisors (in-kind transfer avoids tax events)
- Charitable givers wanting to donate most-appreciated lots

Poor fit:
- Tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) — TLH provides no benefit
- Small accounts under $50K — fee drag outweighs tax alpha
- Investors wanting simplicity — SMAs generate complex tax reporting
- Short time horizons — TLH benefits compound over years

---

## The wash sale complication

Tax-loss harvesting in SMAs requires careful coordination. The IRS wash sale rule disallows a loss if a "substantially identical" security is purchased within 30 days before or after the sale. This means:

- If you own the same stock in another account (401(k), IRA, another brokerage), the SMA manager may inadvertently trigger wash sales
- Investors with multiple accounts need to coordinate across all of them
- Direct indexing managers use substitute securities (e.g., sell stock A, buy highly correlated stock B) to maintain exposure while avoiding wash sales

This coordination burden is a real operational cost that investors often underestimate.
