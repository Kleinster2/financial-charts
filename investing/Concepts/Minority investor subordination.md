# Minority Investor Subordination

**The hard lesson:** Minority equity investors with contractual protections — consent rights, blocking rights, LLC agreement provisions — can still be wiped out when a company hits distress. Contracts matter less than capital structure.

## The Amazon-Saks cautionary tale

[[Amazon]] invested $475M for 23% of [[Saks Global]] in Dec 2024. The deal included:

| Protection | What it said |
|------------|--------------|
| Consent rights | Amazon approval required for new financing under LLC agreement |
| Collateral claim | Deal secured by Fifth Avenue flagship ($3.6B) |
| Commercial agreement | $900M guaranteed payments over 8 years |

**What happened:**
1. **Aug 2024:** Saks raised $600M from bondholders using flagship as collateral — *without Amazon's consent*
2. **Jan 2026:** Saks filed Chapter 11, pledged flagship for $1.75B [[DIP financing]]
3. **Court ruling:** Judge approved DIP over Amazon's objection
4. **Result:** Amazon's $475M stake "presumptively worthless"; consent rights ignored

**Amazon's response:** Threatened "drastic remedies" (examiner, trustee) but lost the courtroom fight.

### The structural trap

Amazon invested at **HoldCo II** level (Saks Fifth Avenue HoldCo LLC), which wholly owns the flagship via Saks Flagship Real Property LLC ("Flagship PropCo"):

```
Saks Global Holdings LLC (parent)
    └── HoldCo II (where Amazon invested)
            └── Flagship PropCo (owns 611 Fifth Avenue)
```

**The problem:** HoldCo II is "member-managed" with **no independent directors**. Decisions roll up to Saks management. Amazon argued HoldCo II had "no material expenses" and didn't need the DIP — but no independent fiduciary was protecting Amazon's interests.

Amazon even offered **separate DIP financing** just for HoldCo II. Rejected.

## Why contractual protections fail in distress

| Protection | Why it doesn't work |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Consent rights** | Courts prioritize company survival over minority consent |
| **Blocking rights** | Can trigger fiduciary duty to company (Pace Industries) |
| **Collateral claims** | DIP priming liens jump ahead of existing security |
| **Board seats** | Directors owe duties to all stakeholders, not just appointing investor |
| **Information rights** | Knowing about problems ≠ ability to stop them |

### The legal doctrine

**Section 510(b):** Equity-related claims are subordinated to all debt in bankruptcy. You can't "bootstrap" an equity position into a debt claim through breach of contract or fraud theories.

**Fiduciary duties:** Courts have imposed fiduciary duties on minority shareholders who try to block bankruptcy filings (Pace Industries). Using blocking rights to protect your investment at expense of other creditors can backfire.

**Absolute priority rule:** In theory, senior claims paid before junior claims. In practice, equity holders sometimes negotiate for scraps to avoid litigation delays.

## When minority protections matter

| Scenario | Protection helps? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Company healthy, governance dispute | Yes — contracts enforced |
| Company stressed but solvent | Maybe — depends on leverage |
| Company insolvent / Chapter 11 | Rarely — survival trumps minority rights |
| Company liquidating | No — equity wiped by definition |

**The window:** Protections work when the company *could* survive without breaching them. Once survival requires breach, courts side with survival.

## Lessons for minority investors

### Structural protections that work better

| Protection | Why it's stronger |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Debt, not equity** | Senior in capital structure; harder to subordinate |
| **Security interest** | Specific collateral claim (though can still be primed) |
| **Put rights** | Exit mechanism before distress |
| **Pay-to-play** | Protects in future rounds, not bankruptcy |
| **Co-sale rights** | Liquidity in M&A, not distress |

### Due diligence questions

- What's the existing debt load? (More debt = more senior claims ahead of you)
- Who are the existing secured creditors? (They'll fight for collateral)
- What's the liquidation value vs. debt? (If debt > liquidation value, equity is worthless)
- Does management have aligned incentives? (Will they protect you or creditors?)

---

## Case precedents

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| **Pace Industries (Del. 2020)** | Minority with blocking rights owes fiduciary duty; can't block bankruptcy to protect own interest |
| **Section 510(b) cases** | Equity-related claims subordinated to all debt |
| **Equitable subordination** | Insider creditors held to higher standard; can be pushed behind other creditors |

## Investment implications

**For tech companies investing in retail/traditional businesses:**
- Amazon's Saks experience: $475M wiped despite contractual protections
- Minority equity is not a "safe" way to gain strategic access
- If the partner fails, your investment fails — no amount of consent rights changes that

**For PE minority investments:**
- Preferred stock is still junior to all debt
- Consent rights matter in governance, not survival
- Board seats don't prevent management from prioritizing creditors in distress

**For credit investors:**
- Minority equity drama creates opportunity
- When equity fights creditors, creditors usually win
- DIP financing is the real leverage in bankruptcy
