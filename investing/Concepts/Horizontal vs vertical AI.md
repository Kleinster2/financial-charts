Horizontal vs vertical AI — the platform-versus-specialist debate shaping AI software investing. Do general-purpose AI platforms ([[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]], [[Google]]) subsume vertical specialists ([[Harvey]], [[RELX]], [[Pigment]], [[Synthesia]]), or do specialists retain durable moats?

## The debate

Triggered by [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|Claude Cowork launch]] (Jan 2026), which sent vertical AI stocks into freefall — $285B erased from software/analytics companies in two days.

The core tension: horizontal platforms keep expanding into vertical territory via plug-ins, subagents, and customization tools. But vertical specialists argue their value comes from domain-specific data, workflow integration, and regulatory compliance that generalists can't replicate with surface-level tooling.

[[Pigment]] CEO Eléonore Crespo: "Generalists are for play, but specialists are for work." Specialist providers succeed because they understand unique data structures, integrate into workflows, and provide governance/auditability.

## Vertical-by-vertical assessment

### Legal — specialists winning (for now)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Specialist moat | Complete legal libraries, case law databases, regulatory compliance |
| Key players | [[Harvey]], [[Legora]], [[Luminance]], [[RELX]] / LexisNexis |
| Platform weakness | [[JPMorgan]]: Cowork "just catching up," lacks complete legal library |
| Architecture | [[Harvey]] and [[Legora]] use Anthropic/[[OpenAI]] models underneath but built proprietary tooling |
| Quality gap | Legal workers criticized Cowork plug-in for using Wikipedia as source |

[[Luminance]]'s Harry Borovick: domain-specific tools increase in value as generalists expand — because the comparison makes specialization more visible. [[Legora]] CEO Max Junestrand dismissed plug-ins as insufficient.

**Assessment:** Legal is the strongest vertical defense case. Regulatory requirements, liability risk, and need for authoritative sources create genuine moats. Specialists are application-layer companies using horizontal models as infrastructure — the model layer is commoditized but the application layer isn't.

### Advertising/creative — horizontal more threatening

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Specialist moat | Weak — creative judgment, client relationships |
| Key players | [[WPP]], [[Publicis]] |
| Platform threat | Generic models enable clients to DIY, cutting out agencies entirely |
| Architecture | [[WPP]] already uses Gemini/[[OpenAI]]/Anthropic under the hood |
| Disruption vector | Not vertical AI replacing agencies — horizontal AI enabling clients to skip agencies |

Super Bowl 2026 signaled the shift (Svedka Vodka AI-generated ad). The bigger risk isn't [[Synthesia]] or [[Writer]] replacing agencies — it's Claude/GPT enabling marketing directors to produce campaigns themselves.

**Assessment:** Advertising is the most vulnerable vertical. Low regulatory moat, subjective quality standards, and the disintermediation vector (clients skip agencies) is uniquely enabled by horizontal platforms.

### Finance/business planning — mixed

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Specialist moat | Proprietary data models, auditability, workflow integration |
| Key players | [[Pigment]] (business planning), [[Goldman Sachs]] (building on Claude) |
| Platform opportunity | [[Goldman Sachs]] working with Anthropic on AI agent to automate bank roles |
| Real-world proof | [[Supercell]]: monthly report 3 hours → 5 minutes via [[Pigment]] AI agent |

[[Goldman Sachs]], [[Uber]], [[Netflix]], [[Salesforce]], [[Allianz]] all building on Claude — suggesting large enterprises see horizontal platforms as infrastructure, not replacement for specialized tools.

**Assessment:** Finance splits two ways. Business planning tools like [[Pigment]] have data-structure moats. But banks are building directly on horizontal platforms, suggesting some financial workflows don't need vertical intermediaries.

### Enterprise learning — vertical advantage

[[Synthesia]] and the [[AI-native enterprise learning]] space represent a vertical where specialization clearly wins: avatar generation, multilingual content, compliance-specific workflows. Generic models can't match the production pipeline.

## The workflow orchestration layer

The real moat claim from vertical AI companies isn't "we use better models" — it's "we built the orchestration layer that chains AI capabilities into professional-grade workflows."

What this looks like in practice:

[[Legora]] Workflows (launched Jun 2025): lawyers enter a plain-language goal ("run due diligence on these 2,000 documents"), upload files, and the system autonomously plans multi-step execution — tabular extraction → case law web search → citation verification via legal database → draft report sections. No no-code builder. Firm-specific protocols baked in. Their Portal product goes further: firms productize their expertise and deliver to clients through custom AI workflows and playbooks.

[[Harvey]]: similar multi-step chains for document review, contract analysis, brief drafting — integrated with LexisNexis, iManage, NetDocs for data retrieval.

[[RELX]] / LexisNexis (Jan 2026): hundreds of pre-built, configurable workflows for disputes, case strategy, and other legal processes. Deployable out-of-box or tailored with firm-specific guidance.

[[Anthropic]] Cowork: plug-ins + subagents for company-specific processes. Same agentic pattern, but generic — no domain-specific tool integrations, no firm protocol adherence, no legal database verification steps.

The pattern across all of these: agentic AI that chains tools together in domain-specific sequences. The question is whether the domain-specific sequencing is the moat (vertical bull case) or whether horizontal platforms will learn those sequences from usage data (horizontal bull case).

Key difference: vertical orchestration includes domain-specific quality checks (citation verification, compliance audit trails, regulatory flag triggers) that horizontal platforms skip. This is where Luminance's "consistency and trust" argument lands — it's not about the AI being smarter, it's about the chain having the right checkpoints.

## The architecture question

Most vertical AI companies are application-layer businesses built on horizontal model infrastructure:
- [[Harvey]] uses Anthropic/[[OpenAI]] models
- [[WPP]] uses Gemini/[[OpenAI]]/Anthropic
- [[Pigment]] integrates AI into proprietary planning engines

This creates a paradox: vertical specialists depend on horizontal platforms, but their value-add is the proprietary layer on top. The investment question is whether that layer is thick enough to justify independent valuations, or whether platforms will replicate it.

## Investment implications

### Defensible verticals (specialist moat holds)
- **Legal**: Regulatory requirements, liability, authoritative data needs
- **Enterprise learning**: Production pipeline complexity, avatar/multilingual tooling
- **Healthcare/life sciences**: Regulatory compliance, clinical data requirements

### Vulnerable verticals (horizontal disruption risk)
- **Advertising/creative**: Low regulatory moat, client disintermediation vector
- **Generic business software**: Workflow automation easily replicated by plug-ins
- **Staffing/recruitment**: Information intermediary model compresses

### The "infrastructure layer" play
Companies like [[Goldman Sachs]] building directly on Claude suggest the winning model may be: **horizontal platform as infrastructure + proprietary data/workflow as moat**. The vertical AI companies most at risk are those whose "proprietary layer" is thin — essentially UI wrappers on foundation models.
