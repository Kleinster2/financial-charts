## Belt & Road investment (H1 2025)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Africa BRI investment** | **$39B** | #1 destination globally |
| Africa construction contracts | **$30.5B** | +395% YoY |
| Total global BRI (H1 2025) | $124B | Record — exceeds all of 2024 |

**Major projects:**

| Project | Value | Country |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Oil/gas processing | Multi-billion | [[Nigeria]] |
| Standard-gauge railway | Multi-billion | Tanzania |
| Port expansion | Billions | Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire |
| Highway networks | Billions | Multiple |

**Key investors:** East Hope Group, Xinfa Group, Longi Green Energy (private sector leading)

## Strategic drivers

**China's calculus:**
1. US tariffs cut exports 20% → redirect to Africa
2. Build infrastructure that locks in Chinese goods
3. Secure commodities (oil, minerals, rare earths)
4. Consumer brands following infrastructure investment
5. Geopolitical influence (53 of 54 African countries in BRI)

**Africa's appeal:**
- 1.4B population (larger than China)
- Fastest-growing consumer market
- Infrastructure gap = demand for Chinese construction
- Favorable financing terms vs Western alternatives

## Debt dynamics

**Restructuring cases:**

| Country | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Chad | Restructured 2023 |
| Zambia | Restructured 2024 |
| Ghana | MoU signed 2025 |
| Ethiopia | Preliminary agreement 2025 |

**Lowy Institute (2025):** For 54 developing countries, debt repayments to China exceed those owed to Paris Club creditors.

**Beijing response:** Shifted to "small and beautiful" model — smaller, greener, less financially risky projects.

---

## Evolution of model

| Era | Model | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 2000s-2010s | **Resources for infrastructure** | Commodities, mega-projects |
| 2015-2020 | **Debt-fueled BRI** | Railways, ports, power plants |
| 2021+ | **Consumer + green** | Solar, EVs, consumer goods, smaller projects |

**CNBC:** "Old investment model fades" — Chinese consumer brands now flooding African markets.
