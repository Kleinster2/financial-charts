**Inflation** — Rate of price increase in the economy. Fed targets 2% (PCE). After peaking at 9.1% (Jun 2022), now cooling toward target. Key driver of Fed policy, asset allocation, and risk appetite.

## Key measures

| Measure | What it tracks | Fed preference |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **CPI** | Consumer prices (fixed basket) | Headline attention |
| **Core CPI** | CPI ex-food & energy | Less volatile |
| **PCE** | Personal consumption expenditure | **Fed's target measure** |
| **Core PCE** | PCE ex-food & energy | **Primary policy guide** |

**CPI vs PCE:** CPI typically runs ~0.4pp higher than PCE due to methodology differences.

## The 2021-2024 inflation cycle

| Phase | Dates | Peak/Trough | Driver |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Liftoff** | Mar 2021 | 2.6% | Reopening, stimulus |
| **Acceleration** | 2021-2022 | — | Supply chains, energy |
| **Peak** | Jun 2022 | **9.1% CPI** | Ukraine war, commodities |
| **Decline** | Jul 2022-2024 | — | Fed hikes, supply healing |
| **Last mile** | 2024-2026 | 2.6-2.9% | Sticky services, shelter |

**Fed response:** 0% → 5.25-5.50% (525bp in 16 months) — fastest hiking cycle in 40 years.

## Why "last mile" is hard

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Goods | Deflating | Resolved |
| Energy | Volatile | Manageable |
| Shelter | Sticky | Lagged rents still elevated |
| Services ex-shelter | Sticky | Wage-driven |

**The problem:** Services inflation (60% of PCE) driven by labor costs. Requires either productivity gains or labor market cooling.

## 2026 forecasts

| Source | Core PCE 2026 | When to 2%? |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Fed (Dec 2025 SEP) | 2.4% | 2027 |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | 2.1% | Late 2026 |
| CBO | 2.4% | 2027 |

**Consensus:** Inflation continues cooling but likely stays above 2% through most of 2026.

## Fed's 2% target

|--------|--------|
| [[Target]] | 2% average (PCE) |
| Framework | Flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) |

| **Deflation** | Bonds rally, growth at risk |
| **Stagflation** | [[Commodities]], gold, quality |
