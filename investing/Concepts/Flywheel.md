# Flywheel

#concept #businessmodel #moat

A self-reinforcing loop where each component accelerates the others. The more the wheel spins, the faster it goes — and the harder it is to stop. Term popularized by Jim Collins in *Good to Great*, later adopted by [[Amazon]] as core strategic framework.

## Why flywheels matter

Flywheels are **compounding machines**. Unlike linear business models where growth requires proportional effort, flywheel businesses gain momentum over time. Early turns are hard; later turns are nearly free.

**Investing implication:** Companies with functioning flywheels often look expensive on traditional metrics but are actually cheap because the flywheel accelerates earnings faster than models predict. The key question: *is the flywheel actually spinning, or is it just a slide deck?*

## Taxonomy

### Capital flywheels

**Pattern:** Collect capital → deploy at spread → returns attract more capital → scale lowers costs → better spreads → more capital

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[Apollo]]/[[Athene]] | Annuity premiums → private credit → spread income → more annuities |
| [[Berkshire Hathaway]] | Insurance float → equity investments → returns → acquire more insurers |
| [[PE-insurance convergence]] | Retirement liabilities → PE-managed float → management fees + spread |

**When it breaks:** Credit losses, duration mismatch, redemptions during stress.

### Data flywheels

**Pattern:** Users generate data → data improves product → better product attracts users → more data

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[TSMC]] | Volume → yield learning → higher yields → more customers → more volume |
| [[World Labs]] | Synthetic environments → robot training → real-world deployment → better environments |
| [[Tesla]] | Miles driven → FSD training data → better autonomy → more buyers → more miles |

**When it breaks:** Data quality degrades, competitors gain access to similar data, regulatory limits on data use.

### Marketplace flywheels

**Pattern:** More sellers → more selection → more buyers → more sellers

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[Amazon]] | Lower prices → more customers → more sellers → lower costs → lower prices |
| [[Mercado Libre]] | E-commerce → payments → credit → more commerce |
| [[Etsy]] | Unique sellers → unique buyers → more unique sellers |

**When it breaks:** Platform takes too much rake, quality degrades, sellers multi-home.

### Network flywheels

**Pattern:** More users → more value per user → more users

Overlaps with [[Network effects]], but flywheel emphasizes the *acceleration* mechanism, not just the steady-state value.

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[Y Combinator]] | Pick winners → alumni help → attract better applicants → more winners |
| [[Bloomberg LP]] | Traders use it → everyone needs it → more traders use it |
| [[Visa]]/[[Mastercard]] | Merchants accept → cardholders use → more merchants accept |

**When it breaks:** Users leave simultaneously (MySpace), platform abuse (Twitter), disintermediation.

### Creator/Content flywheels

**Pattern:** Creators earn → more creators join → more content → more users → creators earn more

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[Roblox]] | Creators build → kids play → Robux flows → more creators build |
| [[YouTube]] | Creators post → viewers watch → ads pay → more creators post |
| [[Lovense]] | Models use → platforms integrate → viewers tip → models recommend |

**When it breaks:** Creator economics deteriorate, platform changes algorithm, competing platforms offer better terms.

### Distribution flywheels

**Pattern:** Distribution builds brand → brand attracts more distribution → scale lowers costs

| Company | Flywheel |
|---------|----------|
| [[SERHANT]] | TV shows → brand awareness → agent recruitment → listings → more content |
| [[Coca-Cola]] | Ubiquitous distribution → brand reinforcement → retailers must carry → more distribution |

**When it breaks:** Distribution channels consolidate, brand relevance fades.

## Identifying real flywheels

**Signs it's working:**
- Growth accelerates without proportional cost increases
- Customer acquisition costs decline over time
- Retention improves as the flywheel spins
- Competitors can't replicate individual components in isolation
- Management talks about it consistently (not just when fundraising)

**Signs it's a slide deck:**
- Growth requires constant capital infusion
- CAC stays flat or increases
- Components don't actually reinforce each other
- "Flywheel" appears in investor presentations but not operating metrics
- Company pivots strategy frequently

## Flywheel vs moat

A **[[Competitive moats|moat]]** protects a business from competition. A **flywheel** accelerates a business over time. They're complementary:

- Flywheel without moat: Competitors copy the model and spin their own wheel
- Moat without flywheel: Protected but not compounding
- Flywheel + moat: The combination that creates generational companies

[[Amazon]]'s flywheel works because the moat (logistics infrastructure, Prime habits, AWS) prevents competitors from replicating the loop. [[TSMC]]'s yield flywheel works because the moat (equipment relationships, talent, customer co-design) can't be copied.

## When flywheels break

Flywheels are powerful but not permanent. They break when:

1. **Key component degrades** — Uber's flywheel depended on cheap VC-subsidized rides; unit economics now constrain growth
2. **External shock** — COVID broke the movie theater flywheel (content → audience → more content)
3. **Platform commoditization** — When the platform becomes a utility, the flywheel stops differentiating
4. **Regulatory intervention** — Antitrust can force unbundling of flywheel components
5. **Take rate extraction** — Platform takes too much, creators/sellers leave (see: App Store backlash)
