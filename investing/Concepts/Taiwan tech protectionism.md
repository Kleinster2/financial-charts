# Taiwan tech protectionism

#concept #geopolitics #semiconductors #taiwan

**Taiwan tech protectionism** — Taiwan's escalating use of legal and trade tools to protect its semiconductor industry. Two dimensions: (1) Talent protection — arrest warrants for Luxshare, OnePlus executives; (2) Diplomatic leverage — chip export restrictions on South Africa (Sep 2025, first use of chips as weapon). Intensified under President Lai Ching-te (2024).

## Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Driver | Protect semiconductor dominance |
| Tools | Arrest warrants, lawsuits, export bans |
| Targets | Chinese recruiters, foreign IP thieves, unfriendly nations |
| Escalation | Significant since Lai Ching-te (May 2024) |

### Two dimensions

| Dimension | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Talent protection** | Luxshare/OnePlus warrants, SMIC raids, Tokyo Electron lawsuit |
| **Diplomatic leverage** | South Africa chip export restrictions (Sep 2025) |

---

## Why Taiwan is cracking down

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **TSMC is everything** | 90%+ leading-edge foundry |
| **Talent is the moat** | Engineers = competitive advantage |
| **China catching up** | SMIC, Huawei advancing |
| **National security** | Chips = Taiwan's "silicon shield" |

**Core fear:** If China poaches enough talent, Taiwan loses its strategic leverage.

## Legal framework

### Cross-Strait Relations Act

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Full name | Act Governing Relations Between People of Taiwan Area and Mainland Area |
| Prohibition | Chinese companies cannot hire locally without approval |
| Violation | Setting up disguised entities to recruit |
| Penalty | Criminal prosecution |

### National Security restrictions

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Chip exports | Require government approval for sensitive tech |
| Personnel | Restrictions on TSMC employees joining Chinese firms |
| IP protection | Trade secret laws with criminal penalties |

| Allegation | Illegal recruiting |
| Company | Major Apple iPhone assembler |
| Status | Warrant issued |

### SMIC raid (2024)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scale | 34 locations raided |
| Companies | 11 Chinese tech firms investigated |
| Method | SMIC set up branch disguised as Samoan entity |
| Finding | Systematic circumvention of hiring rules |

### Tokyo Electron lawsuit (2025)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target | [[Tokyo Electron]] (Japan) |
| Allegation | Failed to prevent IP theft to China |
| Significance | Taiwan suing foreign company |
| Message | Supply chain partners accountable |

### Taiwan blacklists Huawei + SMIC (Jun 2025)

**Unprecedented action** — Taiwan formally blacklisted [[Huawei]] and [[SMIC]] for the first time.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | June 2025 |
| Targets | Huawei, SMIC |
| Action | Formal chip export blacklist |
| Significance | First-ever Taiwan blacklist of Chinese chip companies |

**Context:** Escalation beyond talent protection to direct trade restrictions on Chinese semiconductor leaders.

### South Africa chip export restrictions (Sep 2025)

**First time Taiwan used semiconductor industry as diplomatic weapon.**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | September 23, 2025 |
| Action | Export pre-approval required for bulk of chips |
| Trigger | South Africa seeking to downgrade Taiwan office |
| Demand | Move Taiwan embassy from Pretoria → Johannesburg |
| Context | 2023 BRICS summit (Xi Jinping), G20 Nov 2025 hosting |
| Trade value | ~$4M annual chip exports affected |

### Why South Africa matters

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Diplomatic pressure** | SA severed ties with Taiwan in 1997, now pressuring further |
| **China alignment** | BRICS member, hosting G20 with Xi expected |
| **Taiwan's response** | Using chips as leverage for first time |
| **SA counter-leverage** | Supplies platinum group metals (palladium) for semiconductors |

**Key quote:** "The South African government's actions have undermined our national and public security. We are adopting measures to restrict trade to maintain our sovereignty." — Taiwan International Trade Administration

**Significance:** Shows Taiwan willing to weaponize chip dominance beyond talent protection — a new escalation in economic statecraft.

## Chinese tactics

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Shell companies** | SMIC's "Samoan entity" |
| **Foreign fronts** | Posing as non-Chinese firms |
| **Offshore recruiting** | Meeting candidates outside Taiwan |
| **Premium salaries** | 2-3x Taiwan pay |
| **R&D centers** | Setting up in Taiwan disguised |

---

## Taiwan's tools

| Tool | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Arrest warrants** | Luxshare, OnePlus executives |
| **Lawsuits** | Tokyo Electron |
| **Export bans** | South Africa threat |
| **Raids** | 34 locations in SMIC probe |
| **Employee restrictions** | TSMC personnel rules |

---

## Effectiveness

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Deterrence** | Raising costs/risks for poachers |
| **Enforcement** | Limited if targets stay in China |
| **Symbolic value** | High — signals resolve |
| **Talent retention** | Unknown long-term impact |

**Challenge:** Arrest warrants only effective if executives travel to Taiwan or extradition-friendly jurisdictions.

---

## Investment implications

| For | Implication |
|-----|-------------|
| **Taiwan stocks** | Government actively protecting tech moat |
| **Chinese tech** | Talent acquisition getting harder |
| **Foreign suppliers** | Accountable for IP protection (Tokyo Electron) |
| **Executives** | Personal legal risk for China tech leaders |
| **China-aligned nations** | Risk of chip export restrictions |
| **Commodity suppliers** | Potential counter-leverage (SA palladium) |

### Companies to watch

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[TSMC]] | Crown jewel being protected |
| [[Luxshare Precision]] | Chair under warrant |
| [[OnePlus]] | CEO under warrant |
| [[SMIC]] | Already raided |
| Tokyo Electron | Sued |
