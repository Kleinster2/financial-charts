#concept #private-markets #funds

The emerging category of listed vehicles — closed-end funds, ETFs, interval funds, and investment trusts — that give retail investors direct exposure to private technology companies. Driven by the structural trend of companies staying private longer: US public companies declined from ~7,000 (2000) to ~4,000 (2024), locking retail out of the highest-growth phase.

### US closed-end funds (direct listings / IPOs)

| Fund | Ticker | Exchange | NAV | Mgmt fee | Total exp | Status | Top holdings |
|------|--------|----------|-----|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [[Destiny Tech100]] | DXYZ | [[NYSE]] | $20/share | 2.50% | >2.50% | Live (Mar 2024) | [[SpaceX]] ~35%, [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]] |
| [[Powerlaw Corp]] | PWRL | [[Nasdaq]] | ~$475M | 2.50% | 3.63% | Pending SEC | [[OpenAI]] 32%, [[SpaceX]], [[Anthropic]] |
| [[Robinhood]] Ventures | RVI | [[NYSE]] | $1B target | 2.00% | TBD | Filing | [[Databricks]], Ramp, Revolut |
| [[Fundrise]] Innovation | VCX | [[NYSE]] | ~$457M | 1.85% | TBD | Approved, Mar 2026 | [[OpenAI]], [[SpaceX]], [[Anthropic]], [[Stripe]] |

### US ETFs (daily liquidity, no minimums)

| Fund | Ticker | Exchange | AUM | Expense | Private % | Top private holdings |
|------|--------|----------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| ERShares Private-Public Crossover | XOVR | [[Nasdaq]] | $1.5B | 0.75% | ~15% | [[SpaceX]] ~10-15%, [[Anduril]], [[Klarna]] |
| Baron First Principles | RONB | [[NYSE]] | $93M | 1.00% | ~27% | [[SpaceX]] 21.5%, [[xAI]] 5.4% |

XOVR: first ETF authorized to directly hold private company securities via SPVs. Launched Aug 2024. Primarily public tech (Entrepreneur 30 Index) with ~15% private sleeve.

RONB: launched Dec 2025 by Ron Baron. Highest single SpaceX allocation among all publicly traded ETFs. Also holds [[Tesla]] (13.8%), Shopify, Spotify in public sleeve.

### US interval fund

| Fund | Ticker | Exchange | AUM | Expense | Private % | Top private holdings |
|------|--------|----------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| [[ARK Invest\|ARK]] Venture Fund | ARKVX | [[Nasdaq]] | $41M | 2.90% | 20-85% | [[SpaceX]], [[xAI]], [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Figure AI]], [[Neuralink]] |

Broadest private AI portfolio but smallest AUM. Quarterly redemption windows (5-25% of assets per quarter). Available exclusively through Titan app, $500 minimum, no accreditation required.

### UK investment trusts (LSE, daily liquidity)

[[Baillie Gifford]] dominates this space with four vehicles:

| Fund | Ticker | AUM | Fee | Private % | Top private holdings |
|------|--------|-----|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| [[Schiehallion Fund]] | MNTN | GBP 1.8B | ~0.80% | ~95%+ | [[SpaceX]], [[ByteDance]], Bending Spoons, [[Anthropic]], [[Databricks]] |
| [[Scottish Mortgage]] | SMT | GBP 15.2B | 0.34% | ~35% | [[SpaceX]] 15.1%, [[Anthropic]] |
| [[Edinburgh Worldwide]] | EWI | GBP 852M | ~0.65% | ~16-20% | [[SpaceX]] 15.9% |
| [[Baillie Gifford US Growth\|BG US Growth Trust]] | USA | GBP 839M | ~0.72% | ~35% | [[SpaceX]] 11.4% |

Other UK trusts with material private exposure:

| Fund | Ticker | AUM | Private % | Notes |
|------|--------|-----|-----------|-------|
| RIT Capital Partners | RCP | Large | 32% | Rothschild family vehicle. Diversified macro + private. |
| Chrysalis Investments | CHRY | GBP 818M | High | Entering managed liquidation (EGM Mar 24, 2026). Holds Starling Bank, [[Klarna]]. |
| Molten Ventures | GROW | GBP 808M mkt cap | High | Publicly traded VC firm. Holds [[Revolut]], Ledger. European focus. |

Schiehallion (MNTN) is the purest play at ~90%+ private. Up ~25% YTD in 2026 — 4x the return of Scottish Mortgage. Scottish Mortgage is the cheapest (0.34%) but mostly public stocks.

All Baillie Gifford trusts currently face activist pressure from [[Saba Capital]].

## Fee comparison

| Vehicle | Total cost | Liquidity |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Scottish Mortgage (SMT) | 0.34% | Daily (LSE) |
| XOVR ETF | 0.75% | Daily (Nasdaq) |
| Schiehallion (MNTN) | ~0.80% | Daily (LSE) |
| RONB ETF | 1.00% | Daily (NYSE) |
| [[Fundrise]] VCX | 1.85% | Daily (NYSE, from Mar 2026) |
| [[Robinhood]] RVI | 2.00% (1.00% first 6mo) | Daily (NYSE) |
| [[Destiny Tech100]] DXYZ | >2.50% | Daily (NYSE) |
| [[Powerlaw Corp]] PWRL | 3.63% | Daily (Nasdaq, when listed) |
| ARK Venture ARKVX | 2.90% | Quarterly redemptions |

PWRL is the most expensive listed vehicle. ARKVX adds liquidity restrictions on top of high fees. The Baillie Gifford trusts offer the best fee/access ratio.

## Structural dynamics

### Premium to NAV

Closed-end funds and investment trusts have no creation/redemption mechanism (unlike ETFs). Prices are set by supply/demand, not NAV:

- [[Destiny Tech100]] peaked at ~2,000% premium (Apr 2024), compressed to ~33% (Feb 2026)
- ETFs (XOVR, RONB) can trade closer to NAV through authorized participant mechanism, but illiquid underlying assets limit the arbitrage
- UK trusts historically trade at discounts to NAV — currently mixed

### Valuation conflicts

Most funds have the adviser determine NAV for illiquid holdings AND earn fees on those valuations. [[Powerlaw Corp]] and [[Destiny Tech100]] both have this structure. Only [[Baillie Gifford]] trusts use independent board-level oversight with tiered external valuation.

### The IPO trigger

If [[SpaceX]] or [[OpenAI]] IPO, these vehicles face a paradox:
- Positive: holdings repriced to public market valuations (likely at premium to current marks)
- Negative: retail can buy directly — eliminating the access premium that justifies paying above NAV

Both SpaceX and OpenAI discussed as potential mega-IPOs in 2026.

### SpaceX concentration

Nearly every vehicle has outsized SpaceX exposure:

| Vehicle | SpaceX % |
|---------|----------|
| RONB (Baron) | 21.5% |
| EWI (Edinburgh Worldwide) | 15.9% |
| SMT (Scottish Mortgage) | 15.1% |
| DXYZ (Destiny Tech100) | ~35% |
| USA (BG US Growth) | 11.4% |
| MNTN (Schiehallion) | 9.9% |

This makes most of these vehicles correlated bets on SpaceX valuation, regardless of what else they hold.

## Cautionary precedents

[[Linqto]] — pre-IPO retail platform, filed Chapter 11 Jul 2025. Held >$500M in securities, 11,000+ customers. Found to have structured investments through SPVs owned by the company itself (not customers), sold [[Ripple]] shares at markups above [[SEC]]-permitted cap.

[[Destiny Tech100]] — 2,000% premium to NAV at peak. Daily turnover hit 80% (average holding period ~1.2 days). Short-selling costs exceeded 100% annualized, preventing arbitrage. Stock down 74% from peak despite NAV tripling.

---

## Platform consolidation

The secondary market platforms are being absorbed by incumbents:

| Platform | Acquirer | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| [[Forge Global]] | [[Charles Schwab]] | ~$660M, expected H1 2026 |
| EquityZen | [[Morgan Stanley]] | Completed Jan 2026 |
| CartaX | Public.com | Acquired Aug 2024 |

This suggests the standalone secondary marketplace model is becoming infrastructure, not a standalone business.
