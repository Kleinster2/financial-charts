# Wealth effect

The tendency of consumers to spend more when their perceived wealth increases (typically via rising stock portfolios or home values), even if their income hasn't changed. Central to understanding the [[K-shaped economy]] — rising asset prices boost spending among the wealthy while doing nothing for non-owners.

## Mechanism

- Rising [[S&P 500]] → top decile feels wealthier → increased discretionary spending
- Rising home prices → homeowners feel wealthier but renters feel squeezed
- Estimated marginal propensity to consume from wealth: ~3-5 cents per dollar of wealth gain

## 2025-2026

The wealth effect is amplifying the K-shape: S&P 500 +17% (Jan 2025 to Jan 2026) primarily benefited the top 10% who own ~87% of stocks. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% — who hold just 1% of stock wealth — see no benefit while facing elevated food, housing, and energy costs.
