**Autonomous trucking** — Self-driving trucks for freight. Aurora leads (commercial 2024). Better unit economics than robotaxi. Highway driving simpler than urban. Driver shortage creates urgency.

---

## Why trucking before robotaxi

| Factor | Trucking | Robotaxi |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Routes** | Highway (simpler) | Urban (complex) |
| **Edge cases** | Fewer per mile | Pedestrians, cyclists, chaos |
| **Customers** | B2B (rational) | B2C (emotional) |
| **Economics** | Driver = 40% of cost | Driver = smaller % |
| **Regulation** | Less pedestrian risk | City-by-city politics |
| **Safety bar** | High but achievable | Near-impossible standard |

**Key insight**: Highways are controlled environments. Cities are not.

---

## The driver problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US truck driver shortage | 80,000+ (2024) |
| Average driver age | 46 years |
| Turnover rate | 90%+ annually |
| Hours of Service limits | 11 hours driving / 14 hours on-duty |
| Driver cost | ~$80K/year + benefits |

**Autonomous advantage**: Trucks can run 20+ hours/day vs 11 for humans.

## The economics

### Human-driven trucking

| Cost component | % of total |
|----------------|------------|
| Driver | 35-40% |
| Fuel | 25-30% |
| Equipment | 15-20% |
| [[Insurance]] | 5-10% |
| Other | 10-15% |

### Autonomous trucking (at scale)

| Cost component | Change |
|----------------|--------|
| Driver | → $0 (eventually) |
| Fuel | Lower (optimized driving) |
| Equipment | Higher (sensors, compute) |
| [[Insurance]] | TBD (likely lower) |
| Utilization | 2x (no HOS limits) |

**Unit economics**: 30-40% cost reduction possible at scale.

## The players

### Aurora (leader)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | AUR |
| Market cap | ~$7B |
| Status | **Commercial** (April 2024) |
| Routes | Dallas-Houston corridor |
| Partners | [[Toyota]], PACCAR, Volvo, [[FedEx]] |
| Founders | Ex-[[Google]], Tesla, [[Uber]] AV leads |

See [[Aurora]] for details.

**Why Aurora leads**:
- First to commercial
- Elite founding team (Urmson, Anderson, Bagnell)
- OEM partnerships for vehicles
- Logistics partnerships for customers

### Kodiak [[Robotics]]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Testing |
| Focus | Long-haul trucking |
| Approach | Partnerships with carriers |
| Funding | $250M+ raised |

Smaller, still pre-commercial.

### Torc [[Robotics]] (Daimler)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | Daimler Truck |
| Status | Development |
| Focus | Freightliner integration |
| Timeline | Commercial TBD |

OEM-backed but behind Aurora.

### Gatik

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Focus | Middle-mile (B2B short-haul) |
| Customers | [[Walmart]], Loblaw |
| Routes | Fixed, repeatable |
| Status | Commercial (limited) |

Different segment — short urban routes, not long-haul.

## The casualties

| Company | What happened | Lesson |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **TuSimple** | [[China]] ties, governance chaos, delisted | Geopolitical risk matters |
| **Embark** | Ran out of money | Capital intensity |
| **Plus** | Pivoted to ADAS | L4 trucking is hard |
| **Ike [[Robotics]]** | Acquired by Nuro | Consolidation |

**Pattern**: Most AV trucking startups failed. Aurora is the survivor.

---

## Why long-haul first

| Segment | Complexity | Economics |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Long-haul (interstate)** | Lowest | Best (driver shortage acute) |
| **Regional** | Medium | Good |
| **Middle-mile** | Medium | Moderate (Gatik) |
| **Last-mile** | Highest | Hardest (urban) |

Aurora's strategy: Start with easiest (interstate highways), expand from there.

---

## The hub-to-hub model

**How it works**:

```
Human driver → Transfer hub → Autonomous highway → Transfer hub → Human driver
   (urban)        (edge of city)    (interstate)      (edge of city)    (urban)
```

**Why it works**:
- Autonomous handles easy highway miles
- Humans handle hard first/last mile
- Transfer hubs at city edges
- Maximizes autonomous utilization

Aurora calls this "terminals" at highway junctions.

## Regulatory landscape

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Texas | Permissive — Aurora operating |
| Arizona | Permissive |
| Florida | Permissive |
| California | Restrictive |
| Federal | No comprehensive framework |

**Texas advantage**: Pro-business, large freight market, Aurora's home.

---

## OEM partnerships

| OEM | Partner | Role |
|-----|---------|------|
| PACCAR | Aurora | Peterbilt/Kenworth trucks |
| Volvo | Aurora | Volvo trucks |
| Daimler | Torc (owned) | Freightliner |
| [[Toyota]] | Aurora | Investment + vehicles |

**Key insight**: Aurora doesn't build trucks — partners do. Asset-light model.

---

## Customer pipeline

| Customer | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| [[FedEx]] | Pilot partner |
| [[Uber]] Freight | Logistics platform |
| Werner | Carrier partner |
| Schneider | Carrier partner |

Freight customers are rational B2B buyers — if economics work, they'll adopt.

---

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2017 | Aurora founded |
| 2021 | SPAC merger (AUR) |
| 2023 | Driverless testing begins |
| **April 2024** | **Commercial launch** |
| 2025+ | Route expansion |
| 2027+ | Scale operations |

## Investment implications

### Bull case

| Factor | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Commercial revenue | No longer pre-revenue |
| Driver shortage | Structural demand driver |
| Unit economics | 30-40% cost savings possible |
| OEM partnerships | De-risked vehicle supply |
| Consolidation | Aurora won, competitors dead |

### Bear case

| Factor | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Cash burn | Still losing money |
| Scale timeline | Years to profitability |
| Regulation | Federal rules unclear |
| Competition | Daimler/Torc, new entrants |
| Safety incidents | One crash = setback |

### How to play

| Approach | Vehicle |
|----------|---------|
| **Direct** | Aurora (AUR) — only pure play |
| **OEM exposure** | PACCAR (PCAR), Volvo |
| **Logistics platforms** | [[Uber]] (UBER) via [[Uber]] Freight |

## vs Autonomous robotaxi

| Metric | Trucking | Robotaxi |
|--------|----------|----------|
| First commercial | Aurora (2024) | Waymo (2020) |
| Profitable | Not yet | Not yet |
| Path to profit | Clearer | Unclear |
| TAM | $800B US trucking | $1T+ ride-hail |
| Competition | Aurora leads | Waymo leads |

**Trucking thesis**: Harder to build moat but clearer economics.
