**China economic transition** — Traditional economy (property, infrastructure) collapsing faster than new industries (EVs, solar, batteries) can grow to replace it. The core macro challenge for China 2023-2025+.

## The problem

**Traditional industries fell ~5pp of GDP (2023-2025), new industries grew <1pp.**

## GDP contribution shift (2023 → 2025)

### Traditional industries (declining)

| Sector | 2023 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Property/residential construction | ~16% | ~10% | **-6pp** |
| Infrastructure | ~3% | ~3% | flat |
| Gasoline vehicles | ~1% | ~2% | +1pp |
| **Total traditional** | **~20%** | **~15%** | **-5pp** |

### New industries (stagnant)

| Sector | 2023 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|
| Robotics | small | small |
| AI | small | small |
| Power construction | small | small |
| Solar | ~1% | ~1% |
| Lithium-ion batteries | ~1% | ~1% |
| New energy vehicles | ~2% | ~2% |
| **Total new** | **~6%** | **~6%** |

**Key insight:** New industries added <1pp of GDP despite massive policy push. Traditional economy lost 5pp.

## Intermediate goods winners and losers (2023-2025)

Changes in intermediate goods demand to fulfill final demand (billions of yuan):

| Sector | Traditional | New Three + Power | Net |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| Steel rolling products | **-700B** | +100B | -600B |
| Gypsum & cement | -400B | +50B | -350B |
| Road freight transport | -350B | +100B | -250B |
| Banking service | -350B | +50B | -300B |
| Coal mining | -300B | +50B | -250B |
| Auto parts | -200B | **+400B** | +200B |
| Electronic components | -150B | +50B | -100B |
| Electric motors | ~0 | +50B | +50B |
| Batteries | ~0 | +100B | +100B |
| Boilers & prime movers | ~0 | +50B | +50B |

**"New Three"** = EVs, batteries, solar

**Only auto parts shows net positive** — EV production offsetting ICE decline.

## Why new industries can't fill the gap

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Scale mismatch** | Property was 16% of GDP; new industries are 6% combined |
| **Export dependence** | EVs/solar/batteries face tariffs in key markets |
| **Overcapacity** | Domestic market saturated, margins compressed |
| **Multiplier effects** | Property drives steel, cement, banking; EVs don't |

## Investment implications

**Bearish signals:**
- Traditional economy deflating faster than expected
- New industries not achieving escape velocity
- Banking sector exposure to property still large
- Stimulus required to prevent hard landing

**Watch for:**
- Fiscal stimulus scale (does Beijing accept slower growth?)
- Export market access for "New Three"
- Property stabilization measures
- Consumption recovery (or lack thereof)
