## How MBS work

**Pass-through structure:**

1. Borrower makes mortgage payment
2. Servicer collects, passes to trust
3. Trust distributes to MBS holders
4. Principal + interest "pass through"

**Key variables:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Prepayment speed** | Faster = reinvestment risk |
| **Interest rates** | Lower rates → faster prepays |
| **Credit quality** | Agency = no risk; non-agency = varies |
| **Duration** | Negative convexity (extends when rates rise) |

---

## Key buyers

| Buyer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Federal Reserve** | Largest holder (QT reducing) |
| **Banks** | $2.7T holdings |
| **[[Mortgage REITs]]** | Annaly, AGNC |
| **Insurance companies** | Long-duration match |
| **Pension funds** | Yield + safety |
| **Foreign investors** | Dollar assets |

---

## Fed impact

**QE (2020-2022):** Fed bought MBS aggressively → spreads compressed.

**QT (2022-present):** Fed letting MBS roll off → spreads widened.

| Fed balance sheet | MBS spread impact |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Expanding (QE) | Tighter spreads |
| Shrinking (QT) | Wider spreads |
| Stable | Supply/demand driven |

---

## Prepayment dynamics

| Rate environment | Prepayment speed | MBS impact |
|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Rates falling | Fast (refis) | Reinvestment risk, negative convexity |
| Rates rising | Slow | Extension risk |
| Rates stable | Moderate | Predictable cash flows |

**Negative convexity:** MBS shortens when rates fall (bad) and extends when rates rise (also bad).

---

## Investment implications

**Current opportunity:**
- Spreads wider than historical average
- Agency MBS = no credit risk
- Relative value vs tight IG corporates
- Fed QT headwind may be peaking

**Risks:**
- Rate volatility
- Prepayment uncertainty
- Fed policy shifts
- Duration/convexity complexity
