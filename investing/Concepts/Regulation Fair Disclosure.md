**Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD)** — [[SEC]] rule adopted August 2000, effective October 2000. Prohibits public companies from selectively disclosing material nonpublic information to favored investors, analysts, or institutions before disclosing it to the general public.

## What it changed

| Before Reg FD | After Reg FD |
|---------------|--------------|
| CFOs could share quarterly results privately with large investors | All material disclosures must be simultaneous and public |
| Analysts received guidance in private calls | Earnings guidance must be broadly disseminated |
| Institutional investors had information advantages built into the system | Level playing field (in theory) |

Pre-Reg FD, corporate access was a legal edge. Investors like [[Warren Buffett]] had extraordinary networks — CFOs would share undisclosed results in private conversations. This was standard practice, not insider trading, because selective disclosure wasn't prohibited.

## Impact on markets

- Shifted corporate communication toward public earnings calls, press releases, 8-Ks
- Reduced information asymmetry between institutional and retail investors
- Compressed the window for acting on material information
- Increased importance of independent research and quantitative analysis

## The Buffett debate

[[Chamath Palihapitiya]] argued on the All-In Podcast (Feb 2026) that [[Warren Buffett]]'s alpha disappeared precisely when Reg FD took effect — that pre-2000 outperformance was driven by "networks of information arbitrage" that became illegal.

The data supports the timing: [[Berkshire Hathaway]] generated ~16.8% annual alpha vs Russell 1000 Value (t-stat 3.13) from 1981–2002, then roughly tracked or trailed the S&P 500 over the next two decades.

However, the [[Buffett's Alpha]] paper (Frazzini, Kabiller & Pedersen) attributes the outperformance to leverage via cheap insurance float and systematic factor tilts (low-beta, high-quality), not primarily to information advantages. Reg FD is likely *part* of the explanation, but not the whole story — size constraints, factor crowding, cash drag, and sector mismatch would have eroded returns regardless.
