# Retail Apocalypse

**The mass extinction of traditional retail** — a wave of store closures, bankruptcies, and mall deaths that accelerated from 2017-2020. Driven by e-commerce (especially [[Amazon]]), over-supply of retail space, and the decline of the American middle class.

---

## The scale

| Year | Store closures | Bankruptcies | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| 2017 | 8,000+ | 50 | Term "retail apocalypse" gains traction |
| 2018 | 5,800 | ~20 | Sears bankruptcy |
| 2019 | **9,302** | ~25 | Highest on record |
| 2020 | 9,700 | **30** | COVID accelerates closures |
| 2021 | ~5,000 | 21 | Recovery begins |

**Cumulative:** ~40% of US department stores closed since 2016.

---

## The causes

### 1. E-commerce shift ("The Amazon Effect")

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Amazon's share of e-commerce | 44% |
| Amazon's share of retail growth (2017) | >50% |
| E-commerce share of retail (projected 2027) | ~25% |

**The math:** Every dollar spent online is a dollar not spent in stores. Amazon's logistics advantage (Prime, same-day delivery) made physical retail uncompetitive for many categories.

### 2. Retail over-supply

| Country | Retail sq ft per capita |
|---------|------------------------|
| **United States** | **23-25** |
| Canada | ~14 (40% less) |
| United Kingdom | ~5 (5x less) |

The US built far more retail space than it needed. Mall construction from 1970-2015 grew at 2x population growth.

### 3. Mall decline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mall visits 2010 → 2013 | -50% |
| Mall decline 2017-2022 | -16.7%/year |
| Credit Suisse forecast (2017) | 25% of malls close by 2022 |
| UBS forecast | 80,000 more stores to close (9% of total) |

### 4. [[Middle class decline]]

Declining real wages + rising costs → less discretionary spending. The middle-income share of population fell from 61% (1971) to 50% (2023). Department stores (Macy's, JCPenney, Sears) built for middle-class shopping were squeezed between:
- **Luxury** (resilient wealthy consumers — top 19%)
- **Value** (Dollar stores, off-price like TJX — serving growing lower tier)

## The casualties

### Department stores

| Company | Event | Year | Outcome |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| **Sears** | Bankruptcy | Oct 2018 | 5 stores remain (2025) |
| **JCPenney** | Bankruptcy | May 2020 | 850 → ~650 stores |
| **[[Neiman Marcus]]** | Bankruptcy | 2020 | Emerged, then [[Saks-Neiman merger]] |
| **Lord & Taylor** | Closed | 2020 | All stores liquidated |
| **Barneys New York** | Liquidated | 2020 | Brand sold |
| **[[Saks Global]]** | Bankruptcy | Jan 2026 | [[Saks bankruptcy]] |

### Specialty retail

| Company | Event | Year |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Toys "R" Us** | Liquidated | 2018 |
| **Payless ShoeSource** | Bankruptcy (2x) | 2017, 2019 |
| **Pier 1 Imports** | Liquidated | 2020 |
| **RadioShack** | Bankruptcy | 2017 |
| **Charming Charlie** | Liquidated | 2019 |
| **Charlotte Russe** | Liquidated | 2019 |

### Mall anchors lost

As department stores closed, malls lost their "anchors" — the big stores that drew traffic. This created a doom loop:
```
Anchor closes
    → Mall traffic drops
        → Small tenants leave
            → Mall dies
                → More anchors close
```

## Timeline

| Phase | Period | Characteristics |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Pre-apocalypse** | 2010-2016 | E-commerce growing, early closures |
| **Peak apocalypse** | 2017-2019 | 8,000-9,000 closures/year, "retail apocalypse" coined |
| **COVID acceleration** | 2020 | 30 bankruptcies, 9,700 closures |
| **Rebound** | 2021-2022 | Stimulus, revenge spending, closures drop 49% |
| **New normal** | 2023+ | Reshuffling: 4,600 closures vs. 5,500 openings |

---

## The survivors

**Who thrived:**

| Category | Examples | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **E-commerce** | [[Amazon]], Shopify merchants | Took the share |
| **Off-price** | TJX, Ross, Burlington | Value-conscious shoppers |
| **Dollar stores** | Dollar General, Dollar Tree | Low-income consumers |
| **Warehouse clubs** | Costco, Sam's Club | Bulk value |
| **Luxury** | [[LVMH]], [[Kering]] (until 2024) | Wealthy consumers resilient |

**Who adapted:**
- **Target:** Invested in stores, same-day fulfillment
- **Walmart:** Built e-commerce, used stores as distribution
- **Best Buy:** Price-matched Amazon, added services

## Counterargument: "Reshuffling, not apocalypse"

IHL Group (2019): "More chains are expanding stores than closing stores."

| Year | Chains opening stores | Chains closing stores | Ratio |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 2018 | — | — | 3.7:1 |
| 2019 | — | — | 5:1 |
| 2023 | 5,500 openings | 4,600 closures | Net positive |

**The nuance:** It's not that retail is dying — it's that *certain formats* are dying (department stores, malls) while others grow (dollar stores, off-price, experiential).

## Real estate implications

The retail apocalypse created the conditions for [[Retail real estate as hidden value]]:
- Saks flagship: $3.7B (2014) → $1.6B (2019) → $3.6B (2024)
- [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]] rents: -18% from 2015 peak to 2019 trough
- [[Richard Baker]]'s thesis: buy department stores below real estate value

**The irony:** Real estate values collapsed during the apocalypse but recovered as luxury brands started *buying* rather than leasing prime locations.

---

## Investment implications

**Short thesis (2017-2020):**
- Mall REITs (CBL, Washington Prime → both bankrupt)
- Department store operators
- Mall-dependent retailers

**Long thesis:**
- E-commerce enablers (Shopify, fulfillment)
- Off-price retailers (TJX, Ross)
- Luxury brands with owned real estate
- Amazon (obviously)

**Current (2025-2026):**
- [[Department store decline]] continues ([[Saks bankruptcy]])
- Luxury real estate recovered ([[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]])
- "Reshuffling" narrative gaining ground
