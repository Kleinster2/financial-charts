## Key actions (Jan 2026)

| Action | Pillar | Note |
|--------|--------|------|

## Direct government equity stakes

**Unprecedented pattern of government taking direct ownership:**

| Company | Stake | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Intel** | Equity stake | Chip manufacturing |
| **US Steel** | "Golden share" | Nippon Steel takeover condition |
| **Kazakhstan tungsten** | Majority stake | Via US private company |
| **ATALCO** | $150M preferred | First US large-scale gallium |

## Shows of force

| Target | Rhetoric | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Venezuela** | "We'll run it" | Maduro captured |
| **Greenland** | "We need it" | Threats, no action yet |
| **Panama** | "Give it back" | Threats, no action yet |
| **Cuba** | (Rubio's target) | Pending — see [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] |
| **Mexico** | Cartels as terrorists | Border deployment |

## Tariffs as weapon

| Target | Justification | Rate |
|--------|---------------|------|
| China | Trade deficit, fentanyl | ~49% general |
| **India** | Russian oil purchases | **50%** |
| Brazil | "Free Bolsonaro" (Moraes pressure) | Threatened |
| Mexico | Immigration, cartels | Threatened |
| Canada | Trade balance | Threatened |
| EU | Auto tariffs | Threatened |

See [[US-China tariffs]], [[US-China trade]], [[Propaganda thru Force]].

## Unintended consequences

Tariffs and pressure creating opposite effects:

| Target | Intended | Actual result |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **India** | Stop buying Russian oil | Pushed India toward China |
| **India-China** | Keep apart (Quad) | Thawing relations, Modi visits Xi |
| **India contracts** | — | India lifting China restrictions ($700B+) |

### India case study (Jan 2026)

50% tariff on India + US-Pakistan warming → India planning to scrap 2020 restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts.

**Losers:** [[BHEL]] (-10.5%), [[Larsen & Toubro]] (-3.1%)

**Strategic cost:** Quad cohesion weakening. India balancing toward China.

See [[India-China relations]] for full analysis.

## Immigration enforcement

| Policy | Status |
|--------|--------|
| TPS terminations | Venezuela (2021, 2023) terminated |
| Deportation flights | Ramping up |
| "Safe country" strategy | Venezuela = safe → deport |
| Travel ban | Expanded |

See [[Venezuela repatriation strategy]].

## Key actors

| Actor | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| **Trump** | All — final authority |
| **Rubio** (State) | Force, Cuba focus |
| **Miller** (WH) | Immigration |
| **Bessent** (Treasury) | Tariffs, China |
| **Hegseth** (DoD) | Military action |
| **Noem** (DHS) | Border, deportations |
| **Homan** | Border czar |

## Economic effects (Posen/Peterson Institute analysis, Jan 2026)

**Thesis:** Stagflationary effects kicking in, should be undeniable by April 2 (Liberation Day anniversary).

| Metric | Current | Forecast |
|--------|---------|----------|
| CPI | 2.7% (Nov 2025) | **4%+ by Q3 2026** |
| Home health-care costs | **12% annual rate** | Rising (labor shortages) |

**Why delayed impact:**
- Decision-making paralysis: businesses waiting for certainty on tariffs, exemptions, court rulings
- Stockpiling buffer: companies front-loaded imports, now depleted
- Migration lag: undocumented families delaying departure decisions

**Deportation reality check:**
- Trump claims: ~1M deported in first year
- Data shows: employment in migrant-dependent industries (health/child-care, agriculture, food processing, residential construction) **unchanged**
- Wages in those sectors: **not rising** (would indicate labor shortages)
- Implication: large-scale departures haven't happened yet

**Investment duality:**
- AI-related capex: driving GDP growth (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Non-AI private investment: **near zero growth**
- Brexit parallel: UK private investment flatlined for years post-referendum

**Adam Posen:** "AI investment and productivity gains may offset contraction from tariffs and deportations in 2026. But stimulus from AI boom and looser fiscal policy will compound inflationary pressures."

See [[Peterson Institute]].

## Investment themes

**Winners:**
- Defense contractors
- Domestic energy
- Border security tech
- Friendshoring beneficiaries
- AI infrastructure (offsetting drag)

**Losers:**
- China-exposed companies
- EM with US tension
- Companies dependent on immigrant labor
- Sectors exposed to tariff pass-through

**Volatility:**
- Oil (intervention risk)
- Venezuela rebuild (execution risk)
- Tariff-sensitive sectors
- EM currencies
- Inflation-sensitive assets
