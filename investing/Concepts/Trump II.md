## Doctrines

| Doctrine | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [[Propaganda thru Force]] | Visible action as messaging — the action *is* the message |
| [[Donroe Doctrine]] | Trump's Monroe — Western Hemisphere is US sphere |
| [[Regime Compliance Doctrine]] | Fear → compliance, not regime change — keep regime, change behavior |

---

## Policy pillars

| Pillar | Theme | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Force** | Shows of US "can do" | Maduro capture, Greenland threats, Panama |
| **Trade** | Tariffs as leverage | China tariffs, Supreme Court case |

## Key actions (Jan 2026)

| Action | Pillar | Note |
|--------|--------|------|
| Maduro capture | Force | [[Maduro capture 2026]] |
| Venezuela oil push | Force + Trade | Stalled — Industry requires rule of law first (see [[WH oil executives Venezuela meeting 2026-01-09]]) |
| Greenland rhetoric | Force | — |
| Panama Canal threats | Force | — |
| TPS terminations | Immigration | [[Venezuela repatriation strategy]] |

## Shows of force

| Target | Rhetoric | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Venezuela** | "We'll run it" | Maduro captured |
| **Greenland** | "We need it" | Threats, no action yet |
| **Panama** | "Give it back" | Threats, no action yet |
| **Cuba** | (Rubio's target) | Pending — see [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] |
| **Mexico** | Cartels as terrorists | Border deployment |

---

## Tariffs as weapon

| Target | Justification | Rate |
|--------|---------------|------|
| China | Trade deficit, fentanyl | ~49% general |
| **India** | Russian oil purchases | **50%** |
| Brazil | "Free Bolsonaro" (Moraes pressure) | Threatened |
| Mexico | Immigration, cartels | Threatened |
| Canada | Trade balance | Threatened |
| EU | Auto tariffs | Threatened |

See [[US-China tariffs]], [[US-China trade]], [[Propaganda thru Force]].

## Unintended consequences

Tariffs and pressure creating opposite effects:

| Target | Intended | Actual result |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **India** | Stop buying Russian oil | Pushed India toward China |
| **India-China** | Keep apart (Quad) | Thawing relations, Modi visits Xi |
| **India contracts** | — | India lifting China restrictions ($700B+) |

### India case study (Jan 2026)

50% tariff on India + US-Pakistan warming → India planning to scrap 2020 restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts.

**Losers:** [[BHEL]] (-10.5%), [[Larsen & Toubro]] (-3.1%)

**Strategic cost:** Quad cohesion weakening. India balancing toward China.

See [[India-China relations]] for full analysis.

## Immigration enforcement

| Policy | Status |
|--------|--------|
| TPS terminations | Venezuela (2021, 2023) terminated |
| Deportation flights | Ramping up |
| "Safe country" strategy | Venezuela = safe → deport |
| Travel ban | Expanded |

See [[Venezuela repatriation strategy]].
