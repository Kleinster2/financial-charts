# Aeroderivative turbines for data centers

Retired aircraft jet engines being converted into land-based natural gas turbines to power [[Data Centers|data centers]] — an emerging workaround to years-long wait lists from incumbent heavy-duty turbine manufacturers.

## Why it's happening

The big three turbine makers — [[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]], [[Mitsubishi]] — control ~80% of the global heavy-duty gas turbine market (Morgan Stanley). All three have years-long order backlogs and are deliberately holding back capacity expansion to avoid repeating past oversupply cycles. Meanwhile, hyperscaler capex exceeds $700B this year. As one analyst put it: *"the lure of that cash pile will generate a lot of creativity in the power sector."*

## How conversion works

Two key modifications to convert a jet engine into a gas turbine:
1. **Replace fuel nozzles** — jet fuel → natural gas
2. **Replace large front fan** with smaller power-generation fan

Converted units can run as **combined cycle** (steam turbine captures waste heat) for primary baseload generation, not just peaking.

## Key players

| Company | Engine source | Scale target | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| [[FTAI Aviation]] | CFM56 (737 engine) | ~100 turbines/year = 2.5 GW | Converting now; stock +42% |
| [[Boom Supersonic]] | Proprietary engine | 4 GW/year by 2030 | First customer [[Crusoe Energy\|Crusoe]] (AI DC startup); turbines 2027 |
| ProEnergy (PE-backed) | 747 engines | Undisclosed | Active |
| [[GE Aerospace]] | Various (incumbent aeroderivatives) | Existing line | Already sells aeroderivatives |
| [[Howmet Aerospace]] (HWM) | Supplier | — | Engine component supplier |
| [[Woodward]] (WWD) | Supplier | — | Engine control systems |

## Scale potential

- **~1,600 commercial engines retired per year** (Jefferies)
- If 1/3 converted → **~13 GW** (~25% of existing global gas turbine capacity)
- Retired military aircraft → up to **40 GW** theoretical (EIA)

### Expected 2028 gas turbine manufacturing capacity (Morgan Stanley)

| Manufacturer | Capacity |
|-------------|----------|
| [[GE Vernova]] | ~23 GW |
| [[Siemens Energy]] | ~20 GW |
| [[Mitsubishi]] | ~15 GW |
| [[Doosan Enerbility]] | ~3 GW |
| [[Caterpillar]] | ~3 GW |
| [[Baker Hughes]] | ~2 GW |
| **Total (2023-2025 avg)** | **~47 GW/year** |

## Bull case

- Fills urgent gap: data centers need power **now**, heavy-duty turbines take years to deliver
- Abundant supply of retired engines (1,600/year commercial + military surplus)
- [[FTAI Aviation]]: Jefferies estimates power business could add $750M EBITDA/year
- Thunder Said Energy: expanding gas turbine manufacturing is *"surprisingly inexpensive"*; marine engine makers can repurpose *"with only minor investment"*

## Bear case / risks

- **Efficiency disadvantage:** [[GE Vernova]] CEO Scott Strazik dismisses smaller aeroderivative units: *"when you're underwriting 20-year business cases, efficiency matters a lot."* Heavy-duty turbines are most fuel-efficient (Thunder Said Energy) — but scarce and expensive
- **Jet engine diversion:** converting retired engines to power could worsen the existing [[Boeing|jet engine shortage]]
- **Pricing power erosion:** success of aeroderivative alternatives could diminish the big three's pricing power
- **Unproven at scale:** conversion programs are early-stage
