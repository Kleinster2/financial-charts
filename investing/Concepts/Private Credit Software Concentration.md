The largest single-sector concentration risk in the $3T [[Private credit]] market. PE firms loaded up on software buyout debt since 2020 — attracted by recurring revenue, high margins, and sticky customers. Now AI threatens to replicate what enterprise software charges for, potentially triggering a wave of defaults in an opaque, illiquid market.

## The numbers

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Software share of BDC investments | ~17% by deal count (#2 sector) | PitchBook |
| Software in speculative-grade credit | $597B-$681B | Deutsche Bank |
| Software as % of spec-grade universe | 14-16% ("all-time concentration") | Deutsche Bank (Steve Caprio) |
| Software share of PIK loans | #1 sector | PitchBook LCD |
| Private credit default rate — aggressive AI scenario | **13%** | UBS |
| Leveraged loan default rate — same scenario | ~8% | UBS |
| High yield default rate — same scenario | ~4% | UBS |

Private credit is 3x more exposed than high yield to software disruption in the worst case.

## Why software became the favorite

Post-2020, PE sponsors and private credit lenders converged on software because:

1. **Recurring revenue** — SaaS subscription models = predictable cash flows (ideal for debt underwriting)
2. **High gross margins** — 70-85% margins provide cushion for debt service
3. **Sticky customers** — High switching costs = low churn = reliable cash flows
4. **Asset-light** — No factories, no inventory — just code and customers
5. **Growth narrative** — "Software is eating the world" justified high leverage

The result: software became the most levered sector in private credit. Many of the largest-ever unitranche loans (PitchBook) have been to software/tech companies.

## The AI disruption trigger

**Feb 2026:** [[Anthropic]]'s new AI tools sparked a software selloff. The tools perform complex professional tasks that software companies currently charge for — raising existential questions about traditional SaaS business models.

**The mechanism:**
```
AI agents replicate software functionality
→ Customer willingness to pay declines
→ Software company revenue/margins compress
→ Cash flows weaken below debt service requirements
→ PIK loans (deferred interest) turn into credit events
→ Defaults spike in private credit portfolios
→ Opaque valuations mask losses until forced recognition
```

**PIK loans are the canary:** Software is the #1 sector for payment-in-kind loans, where borrowers defer cash interest payments. PIK is fine for fast-growing companies building revenue. It becomes toxic if AI-driven revenue compression means that deferred interest can never be repaid.

## Who's exposed

**Private credit managers (stock impact, week of Feb 9, 2026):**

| Firm | Decline | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| [[Ares Management]] | -12% | Software ~6% of total assets (claims limited) |
| [[KKR]] | -10% | PE/credit, software-heavy |
| [[Blue Owl]] | -8% | Just led $1.4B for OneStream (software buyout) |
| [[TPG]] | -7% | PE/credit |
| [[BlackRock]] | -5% | Acquiring [[HPS Investment Partners]] |
| [[Apollo]] | -1% | Less software-heavy |

**Still lending despite warnings:**
- [[Blue Owl]] led $1.4B loan for OneStream (Hg buyout) — Feb 12, 2026
- [[Ares Management]] leading €1.4B for EG A/S (Scandinavian software) — Feb 13, 2026

The incentive structures haven't changed — fees are earned on deployment, not on avoiding losses.

## Key quotes

**Jamie Dimon** ([[JPMorgan Chase]], late 2025): Warned about private credit's "cockroaches" — stress in one borrower signals more hidden trouble.

**Kenny Tang** (PitchBook LCD): "AI disruption could be a credit risk for private credit lenders for some of its Software & Services sector borrowers and perhaps not for others as it depends on which ones are behind the AI curve and which ones are on top of it."

**Mark Zandi** (Moody's Analytics): "There will surely be significant credit problems... the private credit industry is probably currently able to absorb any losses reasonably well, this may not be the case a year from now if the current credit growth continues."

**Jeffrey Hooke** (Johns Hopkins): "Private credit loans to a lot of software companies. If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio."

**Deutsche Bank** (Steve Caprio): Software concentration in speculative-grade credit is at "all-time" levels.

## Why this could be systemic

1. **Opacity:** Private credit isn't marked to market — losses can be hidden until forced recognition
2. **Illiquidity:** No secondary market to offload loans — holders are stuck
3. **Concentration:** 14-16% of the entire speculative-grade universe in one sector
4. **Leverage:** Software buyouts are among the most levered private credit deals
5. **Interconnection:** Many lenders hold the same borrowers — contagion risk
6. **Endowment/pension exposure:** Institutional allocators ([[Wesleyan Endowment]] and others) have significant PE/VC exposure to the same software companies

## Historical parallel

The 2008 financial crisis was driven by concentrated exposure to housing debt in opaque, illiquid structures. Private credit's software concentration shares structural similarities:
- Opaque valuations ✓
- Illiquid holdings ✓
- Single-sector concentration ✓
- Leverage on leverage ✓
- "This time is different" narrative (recurring revenue = safe) ✓

The difference: private credit is smaller ($3T vs $10T+ mortgage market) and better capitalized. But the pattern rhymes.
