**Memory shortage victims** — Companies squeezed by AI-driven memory reallocation. [[HBM]] for AI = less DRAM/NAND for consumers.

---

## The dynamic

**AI cannibalizes consumer memory:**
```
Memory fab capacity (fixed)
        ↓
   Allocation choice
    ↙          ↘
[[HBM]] for AI    [[Consumer]] DRAM/NAND
(high margin)  (constrained supply)
    ↓              ↓
SK Hynix wins   Nintendo loses
```

**Root cause:** [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]], [[Micron]] shifting production to [[HBM]] and high-capacity DDR5 for AI data centers. [[Consumer]] memory deprioritized.

## Price impact (2025)

| Memory type | Price increase |
|-------------|----------------|
| DRAM (consumer) | +41% |
| NAND flash | +8% |
| [[HBM]] | Sold out, premium pricing |

Memory costs now 21-35% of device BOM for many products.

## Victim categories

### Game consoles
| Company | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| [[Nintendo]] | [[Switch]] 2 RAM +41%, $14B market cap loss |
| [[Sony]] | Delaying next-gen past 2028? |
| [[Microsoft]] | Same delay considerations |

[[TrendForce]]: Console shipments -4.4% YoY forecast for 2026.

### PC OEMs
| Company | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| [[Dell]] | "Never seen costs escalate this fast" |
| [[Lenovo]] | 50% above normal inventory, hoarding |
| HP | Double-digit price hikes coming |

### Smartphones
| Company | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| [[Xiaomi]] | +25% DRAM cost per phone (2026) |
| [[Oppo]]/[[Vivo]] | Optimizing specs to stretch supply |

### Memory module vendors
| Company | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| [[Corsair]] | Suspended orders |
| ADATA | Can't get chips |
| Transcend | Halted shipments Nov 2025 |
| G.Skill | Supply constrained |

---

## Timeline

| Period | Outlook |
|--------|---------|
| 2025 | Shortage acute |
| 2026 | Prices continue rising |
| 2027 | Gradual easing possible |
| 2028 | Potential relief |

No near-term fix — [[HBM]] demand only growing.

---

## Investment implications

**Short thesis:** Companies with high memory % of BOM, no pricing power.

**Hedge:** These are also potential beneficiaries if/when memory supply normalizes.

**Related:** [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] covers the supply side. This note covers demand-side victims.

## Why this matters

The AI boom has second-order effects. Memory makers win, but their traditional customers lose. Console/PC/smartphone demand may slow not from weak demand but from supply constraints and price increases.
