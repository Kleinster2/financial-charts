Tracking founder wealth across [[China]]'s AI sector — infrastructure (chips, optical, memory, compute), software (foundation models, AI labs), and machinery (robotics, edge AI). Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Feb 2, 2026. $100.5B collective wealth across all founders — rivaling Bill Gates's $105B, below [[Jensen Huang]]'s $153B.

## Bloomberg Billionaires Index — AI Infrastructure (Feb 2, 2026)

| Rank | Name | Company | Sector | Net Worth |
|------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [[Chen Tianshi]] | [[Cambricon Technologies]] | AI chips | $21.53B |
| 2 | [[Wang Weixiu]] | [[Zhongji Innolight]] | Optical transceivers | $14.35B |
| 3 | [[Zhou Chaonan]] | [[Range Intelligent]] | AI computing | $10.96B |
| 4 | [[Chen Tao]] | [[Victory Giant]] | PCB / interconnect | $9.35B |
| 5 | [[Cai Huabo]] | [[Longsys Electronics]] | NAND flash / memory | $7.07B |
| 6 | [[Zou Zhinong]] & [[Ou Yang]] | [[Suzhou TFC Optical Communication]] | Optical networking | $10.33B (combined) |
| 7 | [[Zhang Jianzhong]] | [[Moore Threads]] | GPUs | $4.16B |
| 8 | [[Chen Weiliang]] | [[MetaX]] | GPUs | $4.21B |
| 9 | [[Zhu Yiming]] | [[ChangXin Memory]] / [[GigaDevice]] | Memory | $2.43B |
| 10 | [[Zhang Yubo]] | [[Moore Threads]] | GPUs (CTO) | $1.6B |
| 11 | [[Zhou Yuan]] | [[Moore Threads]] | GPUs (Director) | $1.32B |
| 12 | [[Wang Dong]] | [[Moore Threads]] | GPUs (VP) | $1.32B |

Total: ~$87.7B+ across infrastructure founders.

The wealth concentration in AI picks-and-shovels mirrors the US pattern ([[NVIDIA]], [[Broadcom]]) but within a sanctions-constrained domestic market. All six companies benefit from [[China]]'s push for semiconductor self-sufficiency — [[export controls]] have created a captive demand pool for domestic alternatives.

Notable: [[Cambricon Technologies]] founder tops the list despite the company originating as a ~$5.5B market cap [[CAS]] spinoff. [[Moore Threads]] founder Zhang Jianzhong is ex-[[NVIDIA]] (former China head).

## Bloomberg Billionaires Index — AI Software (Feb 2, 2026)

| Rank | Name | Company | Net Worth |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | [[Yan Junjie]] | [[MiniMax]] | $5.19B |
| 2 | [[Liu Debing]] | [[Zhipu]] | $1.58B |
| 3 | [[Liang Wenfeng]] | [[DeepSeek]] | ≥$1B |

Total: ~$7.8B+ across three founders.

Software layer wealth is an order of magnitude below infrastructure — $7.8B vs $67.4B. The gap reflects that model companies IPO'd only in Jan 2026 ([[Zhipu]], [[MiniMax]]) while infra companies have been public longer. [[DeepSeek]] remains private and self-funded via [[Liang Wenfeng]]'s [[High-Flyer]] quant fund — Bloomberg's "at least $1B" is a floor estimate.

Notable: [[Yan Junjie]] (MiniMax) is ex-[[SenseTime]], part of the SenseTime alumni pipeline. [[Liu Debing]]'s $1.58B was measured before Zhipu's Feb run to HK$496 (+327%) — likely significantly higher now.

## Bloomberg Billionaires Index — AI Machinery (Feb 2, 2026)

| Rank | Name | Company | Sector | Net Worth |
|------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [[Wang Xingxing]] | [[Unitree]] | Quadruped + humanoid robots | $2.15B |
| 2 | [[Zhou Jian]] | [[UBTech Robotics]] | Humanoid / service robots | $1.91B |
| 3 | [[Chen Ning]] | [[Intellifusion]] | AI vision / edge chips | $1.03B |

Total: ~$5.1B across three founders.

Machinery layer is the smallest — $5.1B vs $67.4B (infra) and $7.8B (software). Robotics is earlier stage: [[Unitree]] is still private, [[UBTech Robotics]] IPO'd only Dec 2024, [[Intellifusion]] listed 2023 on STAR Market. Wang Xingxing built Unitree from a [[Shanghai University]] master's project to a $2.15B personal fortune — the volume/affordability playbook ([[China]] EV pattern applied to robots).
