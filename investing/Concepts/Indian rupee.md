## RBI management style

RBI (Reserve Bank of India) manages rupee with heavy hand:

| Tool | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **FX intervention** | Smooth volatility, not target level |
| **Reserves** | $600B+ war chest |
| **NDF market** | Monitor offshore activity |

Result: INR has low volatility for EM, but steady depreciation trend (~3-4%/year).
