**Indian Rupee (INR)** — Managed float currency. Structurally weak due to current account deficit. RBI actively intervenes.

![[usdinr-chart.png]]
*Steady depreciation from ~71 (2020) to ~92 (Jan 2026). Sharp moves in late 2022 (Fed hikes, oil spike) and late 2025 (tariff fears, foreign outflows). RBI smooths but can't reverse the structural trend.*

## Structural dynamics

### Why INR trends weaker
1. **Twin deficits** — Current account + fiscal deficit
2. **Oil import bill** — ~$150B annually
3. **Inflation differential** — India runs hotter than US
4. **Dollar strength cycles** — EM currencies suffer

### Why INR doesn't collapse
1. **RBI reserves** — ~$600B+ war chest
2. **Remittances** — World's largest ($100B+/year)
3. **IT services exports** — $200B+ annual inflows
4. **FDI** — Steady manufacturing/tech investment
