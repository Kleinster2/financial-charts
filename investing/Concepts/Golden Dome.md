# Golden Dome

Trump's signature missile defense program. Multi-layer system to protect US from "any foreign aerial attack." $151B initial contract, but Bloomberg estimates **$1.1T** for full coverage — 500%+ above official estimate.

---

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Executive order | Jan 27, 2025 |
| Initial contract | $151B IDIQ (Dec 2025) |
| Budgeted (OBBBA) | $25B |
| Trump estimate | $175B |
| CBO (space layer) | $161B-$542B |
| Bloomberg (full) | **$844B-$1.1T** |
| Deadline | Jan 2029 (end of term) |
| Contract end | Dec 2035 |

## The threat scenario

Bloomberg modeled "any foreign aerial attack" (worst case: China + Russia + North Korea):

| Threat | Quantity |
|--------|----------|
| ICBMs | 700 |
| Other ballistic missiles | 510 |
| Boosted hypersonic weapons | 800 |
| Cruise missiles | 1,500 |
| Drones | 10,000 |

More modest scenario (Russia only) still costs **$844B**.

## System architecture

Four integrated layers from ground to space:

### Space-based layer ($161B-$542B)

| Component | Contractor | Function |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Interceptor satellites | See below | Destroy missiles in orbit |
| OPIR GEO | [[Lockheed Martin]] | Track launches from 22,000 miles |
| OPIR Polar | [[Northrop Grumman]] | Watch northern polar route |
| Tracking constellation | Various | Track hypersonic/cruise missiles |

**Technology doesn't exist yet.** Requires 960 satellites, each armed with interceptors.

#### Space-based interceptor competition (Nov 2025)

| Company | Type | Contract | Status |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | Prime | $10M | Ground-testing underway |
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | Prime | — | Established player |
| [[Anduril]] | Startup | $10M | Transitioning to prime |
| True Anomaly | Startup | — | New entrant |
| Apex | Startup | — | 2026 demo, Anduril partner |

**Prize structure:**
- $340M pool for on-orbit test (1st: $125M, 5th: $40M)
- Production contracts: **$1.8B-$3.4B/year**

**Key risk for primes:** If startups build interceptors cheaper, Northrop/Lockheed lose market share.

### Upper atmosphere layer

| System | Contractor | Function |
|--------|------------|----------|
| THAAD | [[Lockheed Martin]] | Short/medium ballistic missiles |
| Aegis Ashore | [[Lockheed Martin]] | Intermediate ballistic missiles |
| SM-3 Block IIA | RTX/Lockheed | Interceptor missiles |
| NGI | [[Lockheed Martin]] | Next-gen interceptors (new Midwest field) |
| GBI | Boeing/Northrop | Ground-based interceptors (AK, CA) |

### Mid atmosphere layer

| System | Contractor | Function |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Patriot | [[RTX]] | Aircraft, cruise missiles, short-range ballistic |
| E-2D Hawkeye | [[Northrop Grumman]] | 360° airborne radar |
| Fighter jets | Various | Intercept with AIM-9X, AMRAAM |

### Lower atmosphere layer (counter-drone)

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| IFPC Inc 2-I | Mobile rocket launcher |
| IFPC-HEL | High-energy laser |
| IFPC-HPM | High-power microwave (drone swarms) |
| DE M-SHORAD | Vehicle-mounted laser |
| MADIS | Electronic warfare + missiles |
| M-LIDS | Jam/control drones |

## Cost breakdown (Bloomberg)

### Space-based layer

| Item | Quantity | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Interceptor satellites | 960 | **$602.5B** |
| GBI missiles | 800-2,022 | $80B-202B |
| OPIR Polar (Northrop) | 5 | $10B |
| OPIR GEO (Lockheed) | 5 | $12.5B |
| Air missile tracking | 1 constellation | $10.2B |

### Upper/mid atmosphere layer

| Item | Quantity | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| E-2D Hawkeye | 25 | $9.4B |
| KC-135 tankers | 60-120 | $4.7B-9.4B |
| F-15 | 60-120 | $3.5B-7.1B |
| F-16 | 60-120 | $2.2B-4.5B |
| AMRAAM missiles | 150-300 | $157M-314M |
| AIM-9X missiles | 150-300 | $95M-189M |

### Total estimates

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Trump estimate | $175B |
| Funds budgeted | $25B |
| Bloomberg (Russia only) | **$844B** |
| Bloomberg (max threat) | **$1.1T** |

**Not included:** Operating costs, personnel, R&D for new technology.

## Historical context

Golden Dome is not the first attempt:

| Era | Program | Outcome |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Reagan | Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") | Abandoned — cost, feasibility |
| Bush 41 | Global Protection Against Limited Strikes | Abandoned — cost, feasibility |
| Current | Ground-based midcourse (44 interceptors) | Limited — AK/CA only |

**Israel's Iron Dome** (Rafael/RTX) is conceptual inspiration, but that system handles short-range rockets, not ICBMs.

## Skepticism

### Timeline

> "The timeline of finishing the project before Trump leaves office in January 2029 was unrealistic from the beginning." — Todd Harrison, AEI

### Survivability

> "The name, the concept, the program of Golden Dome probably does not survive after this administration." — Todd Harrison, AEI

### Arms race risk

Critics warn rapid missile defense expansion could spur Russia/China to accelerate nuclear weapons development, dimming arms control prospects.

### Biden administration view

> "I think that a future administration, a future Congress, would have a hard time looking at all the expenses and the totality of the things that have been thrown out there and saying, 'This is a good idea.'" — Dave Vorland, former acting deputy assistant secretary of space and missile defense policy

## Investment implications

### Bull case

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Scale | Even partial build = $100B+ |
| Duration | Through 2035 |
| Bipartisan | $25B already budgeted |
| Primes benefit | Regardless of full completion |

### Bear case

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Political risk | May not survive administration |
| Technical risk | Space interceptors don't exist |
| Cost overruns | History of missile defense |
| 2029 deadline | Unrealistic |

### Key beneficiaries

| Tier | Companies | Exposure |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Highest** | [[Lockheed Martin]] | NGI, THAAD, Aegis, OPIR |
| **High** | [[RTX]] | Patriot, radar, missiles |
| **Significant** | [[Northrop Grumman]] | OPIR Polar, space, E-2D |
| **Moderate** | [[Boeing]], [[Anduril]], Palantir | Integration, new tech |

## Canada

Trump mentioned Canada could join for **$61B** (~5% of Bloomberg estimate). Details unclear.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 2025 | Executive order signed |
| May 2025 | Oval Office briefing, $175B estimate |
