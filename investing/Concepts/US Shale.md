**US Shale** — Hydraulic fracturing revolution that made US world's largest oil producer. Broke OPEC's pricing power. Now mature, consolidating.

## The shale revolution

**Before shale (pre-2010):**
- US oil production declining for decades
- Dependent on imports
- OPEC controlled global prices
- Peak oil fears

**After shale (2010s):**
- US production: 5M → 13M bpd
- Net exporter by 2019
- OPEC lost pricing power
- Abundant supply crushed prices (2014-2016, 2020)

## Key basins

| Basin | Location | Profile |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Permian | Texas/New Mexico | Largest, most active |
| Eagle Ford | South Texas | Mature, oil-weighted |
| Bakken | North Dakota | Mature, decline phase |
| DJ Basin | Colorado | Gas-weighted |
| Anadarko | Oklahoma | Mature |

**Permian dominance:** ~6M bpd, ~50% of US production

## Why shale disrupted OPEC

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Short-cycle | Wells drilled in weeks, not years |
| Scalable | Respond quickly to prices |
| Private land | No government approval needed |
| Technology gains | Costs fell 50%+ |
| Decline rates | But wells deplete in 2-3 years |

**OPEC's dilemma:** Cut production → shale fills gap. Flood market → lose revenue.

## Current state (2025-2026)

**Maturation signals:**
- Growth slowing (plateau at 13M bpd)
- Consolidation (Exxon-Pioneer, Chevron-Hess)
- Investors demand returns over growth
- Best acreage drilled, Tier 2 remains
- Infrastructure constraints

**Key operators:**
- [[EOG Resources]] — largest independent
- [[ConocoPhillips]] — largest E&P
- [[Chevron]], [[Exxon]] — majors (post-acquisitions)
- Diamondback, Devon, Coterra — mid-caps

## Investment implications

| Theme | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Growth over | Shale now returns-focused |
| Consolidation | M&A continues, fewer players |
| OPEC comeback? | If shale plateaus, OPEC regains influence |
| Services pressure | Less drilling = [[Halliburton]] headwind |
| Permian infrastructure | Midstream bottlenecks |

## Shale vs Venezuela rebuild

| Factor | US Shale | [[Venezuela oil rebuild]] |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| Timeline | Immediate | 3-5+ years |
| Cost | $40-50 breakeven | Lower (conventional) |
| Growth | Plateau | Potential 2M bpd addition |
| Decline | 30-40%/year | Low (conventional) |
| Politics | Stable | Uncertain |

**If Venezuela succeeds:** Adds supply, could pressure shale economics.
