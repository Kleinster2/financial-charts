# Sector Rotation

Capital flows between sectors based on cycle positioning, relative valuations, and policy catalysts. Recurring market phenomenon — tracking current and historical rotations.

## How rotation works

| Rotation type | Trigger | Flow direction |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Growth → Value** | Late cycle, rates rising, valuation stretch | Tech/growth → financials, industrials, energy |
| **Value → Growth** | Early cycle, rates falling, risk-on | Cyclicals → tech, consumer discretionary |
| **Cyclical → Defensive** | Recession fears, risk-off | Industrials → utilities, healthcare, staples |
| **Defensive → Cyclical** | Recovery, risk-on | Utilities → industrials, materials |
| **Large → Small** | Broadening earnings, valuation gap | Mega-cap → Russell 2000 |
| **Domestic → International** | Dollar weakness, relative value | US → EM, Europe |

## Current rotation (January 2026)

**Theme:** Mag 7 → everything else. Earnings growth broadening.

### The setup

| Metric | Mag 7 | S&P 500 | S&P 493 |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Since Oct 29 | -2% | — | +1.8% |
| 2025 return | +25% | +16% | — |
| 2026 YTD | +0.5% | +1.8% | — |
| Forward P/E | 29x | 22x | — |
| 2026E EPS growth | +18% | — | +9% |
| EPS contribution | 46% (2026E) | — | 54% (2026E) |

**Goldman Sachs projection:** Mag 7 EPS contribution falling from 50% (2025) → 46% (2026). S&P 493 earnings growth accelerating 7% → 9%.

**"I call it 'AI fatigue.' I'm tired of it and I suspect a lot of other people are wary of the whole issue."** — [[Ed Yardeni]] (Jan 2026)

### Rotation timing

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Oct 29, 2025** | S&P 500 record high — rotation begins |
| Late Oct | [[Michael Burry]] cryptic warning, shorts [[NVIDIA]] + [[Palantir]] |
| Nov 2025 | Mag 7 selloff, S&P 493 climbs |
| Dec 2025 | XMAG inflows 4x November |
| Jan 2026 | Tax-loss selling + AI fatigue accelerates |
| **Jan 14, 2026** | Russell 2000 beats S&P for 9th straight day — **longest streak since 1990** |

### January 14, 2026 update

**Rotation accelerating:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Russell 2000 vs S&P streak | **9 days** (longest since 1990) |
| S&P 500 | -0.53% |
| Nasdaq | -1.0% |
| Nasdaq 100 | Worst decline in a month |
| Mag 7 | All seven down |
| S&P 500 breadth | 300+ stocks up despite index down |

**Key insight:** While Nasdaq 100 fell to monthly lows, over 300 S&P 500 constituents actually rose. Classic rotation signal — money leaving concentrated leaders, spreading to broader market.

NVIDIA -1.4%, Microsoft -2.4% led tech lower. Small caps continue outperforming.

### [[XMAG]] ETF (S&P 493 proxy)

**Defiance Large Cap Ex-Magnificent Seven ETF** — launched late 2024

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | XMAG |
| 2025 return | +15% |
| Inflow streak | 6 straight months (Jul-Dec 2025) |
| Dec inflows | 4x November (~$38M) |

**Monthly fund flows (2025):**

| Month | Flow | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Jan | ~$10M | |
| Feb | ~$5M | |
| Mar | ~$3M | |
| Apr | ~$2M | |
| May | ~$1M | |
| Jun | ~-$1M | Only outflow month |
| Jul | ~$1M | 6-month streak starts |
| Aug | ~$2M | |
| Sep | ~$4M | |
| Oct | ~$10M | Post-record pivot |
| Nov | ~$8M | |
| **Dec** | **~$38M** | 4x November |

**Pattern:** Rotation accelerated sharply in Q4 — Dec inflows nearly equal Jan-Nov combined.

### Flows

| Out of | Into |
|--------|------|
| Mag 7, high-growth tech | Defense, small caps, financials |
| AI momentum plays | Industrials, utilities |
| Crowded mega-cap | Value, quality |

### Goldman Sachs sector picks (Jan 2026)

**Overweight:** Health care, materials, consumer discretionary, software & services

Rationale: Wide valuation spreads + favorable macro outlook for value.

### Drivers

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **AI ROI scrutiny** | Investors want returns, not capex promises |
| **Tax-delay selling** | Institutions deferred gains to 2026, sold Jan 2 |
| **Valuation reset** | Mag 7 at 29x vs historical avg |
| **Policy catalysts** | Trump defense budget, rate expectations |
| **Earnings broadening** | Growth differential narrowing |

### Analyst 12-month price targets (Jan 2026)

| Stock | Target | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | **+39%** | Highest upside, AI demand |
| [[Microsoft]] | +33% | Copilot monetization |
| [[Meta]] | +29% | Efficiency gains |
| [[Amazon]] | +21% | AWS + automation |
| [[Apple]] | +13% | Steady, "anti-AI" play |
| [[Google]] | +4% | Priced in after +65% in 2024 |
| [[Tesla]] | **-9%** | Only negative target |

### Historical Mag 7 annual returns (2021-2025)

| Stock | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | +125% | -50% | **+240%** | +170% | +35% |
| [[Tesla]] | +65% | -65% | +100% | -5% | +65% |
| [[Meta]] | +25% | -65% | +195% | +65% | +5% |
| [[Google]] | +65% | -40% | +60% | +65% | +5% |
| [[Microsoft]] | +50% | -30% | +55% | +10% | +15% |
| [[Amazon]] | +5% | -50% | +80% | +45% | +10% |
| [[Apple]] | +35% | -30% | +50% | +35% | +5% |
| **S&P 500** | +25% | -20% | +25% | +25% | +25% |

**Key pattern:**
- 2021, 2023, 2024: S&P 500 underperformed most Mag 7
- 2022: S&P 500 outperformed (everything crashed)
- **2025: S&P 500 outperformed several Mag 7** — rare outside of crashes

This is the rotation signal: when the index beats its biggest components, leadership is shifting.

### Winners (Jan 2026)

| Sector/Stock | Move | Catalyst |
|--------------|------|----------|
| Defense | +6-8% | Trump $1.5T budget |
| Russell 2000 | +6% vs Nasdaq | Small cap rotation |
| Financials | Outperforming | Rate cut expectations |

## Historical rotations

| Period | Rotation | Trigger | Duration |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| **2022** | Growth → Value | Fed hiking cycle | Full year |
| **2020-21** | Value → Growth | Covid, zero rates | 18 months |
| **2018 Q4** | Risk-off | Fed overtightening fears | 3 months |
| **2016** | Growth → Value | Trump election, reflation | 6 months |
| **2000-02** | Growth → Value | Dot-com bust | 2+ years |
| **1973-74** | Growth → Value | Nifty Fifty collapse | 2 years |

### Historical parallels to watch

**BCA Research warning:** Past concentrated bull markets (Nifty Fifty 1973, dot-com 2000) didn't transition peacefully — broader market retreated when leaders stumbled.

**"The most benign outcome would be a peaceful transfer of power to a broad coalition of the other 493. That's not how potent and highly concentrated bull markets typically evolve."** — Doug Peta, BCA Research

**Risk:** New leadership may not emerge until US equities suffer a meaningful bear market.

## Indicators to watch

| Indicator | Signal |
|-----------|--------|
| **Growth vs Value relative P/E** | Stretched = rotation risk |
| **Earnings growth differential** | Narrowing = broadening |
| **Fund flows** | Tech outflows, value/small inflows |
| **Russell 2000 / Nasdaq ratio** | Rising = small cap leadership |
| **Sector ETF relative strength** | XLF, XLI outperforming XLK |
| **[[Breadth divergence]]** | Index down but majority of stocks up = rotation (not selloff) |

### Rotation signature pattern

**The key distinction:** In a broad selloff, most stocks fall together. In a rotation, the index can fall while most constituents rise — capital leaving concentrated leaders spreads to the rest.

| Scenario | Index | Breadth | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Broad selloff** | Down | Most stocks down | Risk-off, reduce exposure |
| **Rotation** | Down | Most stocks up | Leadership change, reposition |
| **Healthy rally** | Up | Most stocks up | Broad participation |
| **Narrow rally** | Up | Few stocks up | Fragile, concentration risk |

**Jan 14, 2026 example:** S&P 500 -0.53%, Nasdaq -1.0%, but 300+ S&P constituents rose. This is rotation, not a selloff — money is moving, not leaving.

---

## How long does current rotation last?

| Scenario | Duration | Catalyst to watch |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Tax selling only** | 2-4 weeks | Fades after Jan |
| **Valuation reset** | 1-2 quarters | Q4 earnings (late Jan) |
| **Secular shift** | Full year+ | AI ROI evidence, Fed policy |

---

## Implications for theses

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long NVIDIA]] | Near-term pressure, structural intact |
| [[Long defense AI]] | Validating — rotation INTO defense |
| [[AI hyperscalers]] | ROI scrutiny, but demand real |
