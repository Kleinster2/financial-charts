# Sector Rotation

Capital flows between sectors based on cycle positioning, relative valuations, and policy catalysts. Recurring market phenomenon — tracking current and historical rotations.

---

## How rotation works

| Rotation type | Trigger | Flow direction |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Growth → Value** | Late cycle, rates rising, valuation stretch | Tech/growth → financials, industrials, energy |
| **Value → Growth** | Early cycle, rates falling, risk-on | Cyclicals → tech, consumer discretionary |
| **Cyclical → Defensive** | Recession fears, risk-off | Industrials → utilities, healthcare, staples |
| **Defensive → Cyclical** | Recovery, risk-on | Utilities → industrials, materials |
| **Large → Small** | Broadening earnings, valuation gap | Mega-cap → Russell 2000 |
| **Domestic → International** | Dollar weakness, relative value | US → EM, [[Europe]] |

## Two concurrent rotations (2026)

Capital is leaving the AI/software narrative via two distinct channels with the same sell side but different buy sides:

| | Software → Energy | Large → Small |
|---|---|---|
| **Sell side** | SaaS, software (IGV -25%) | Mag 7, Nasdaq |
| **Buy side** | Large cap energy (XLE +18%) | Russell 2000 (+7% YTD) |
| **Buy side market cap** | Mega ([[Exxon]] ~$530B, [[Chevron]] ~$300B) | Small |
| **Thesis** | Peak oil repricing, AI-proof cash flows | Valuation gap at 25-year extreme |
| **Driver** | Longevity repricing, leverage advantage | Earnings broadening, rate sensitivity |
| **Expression** | XLE vs IGV | IWM vs QQQ |
| **Tracking note** | [[AI workflow disruption basket]] | [[Small cap rotation 2026]] |

| | XLE vs IGV (~43pp) | IWM vs QQQ (~12pp) |
|---|---|---|
| | ![[xle-vs-igv-price-chart.png]] | ![[iwm-vs-qqq-price-chart.png]] |
| | *Software → energy, 90 days* | *Large cap → small cap, 90 days* |

**Divergence scenarios:**

| Scenario | Software → Energy | Large → Small |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Recession fears rise | **Holds** — cash flows, dividends, low leverage | **Reverses** — small caps hit harder (higher leverage) |
| AI fears fade | **Partially reverses** — but peak-oil thesis has independent legs | **Reverses** — software recovers, valuation gap narrows |
| Oil price spike | **Accelerates** — direct earnings boost | **Mixed** — input cost pressure on small industrials |
| Rate cuts | **Neutral** — oil majors not rate-sensitive | **Accelerates** — small caps benefit from floating-rate relief |

The key question: is energy a rotation beneficiary (temporary, reverses when software recovers) or a structural repricing (permanent, peak oil thesis independent of SaaSpocalypse)? The FT article argues the latter — the [[IEA]] pushing demand out to 2050 is not about software fears.

## Rotation 1: Mag 7 → everything else (January 2026)

**Theme:** Earnings growth broadening.

### The setup

| Metric | Mag 7 | S&P 500 | S&P 493 |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Since Oct 29 | -2% | — | +1.8% |
| 2025 return | +25% | +16% | — |
| 2026 YTD | +0.5% | +1.8% | — |
| Forward P/E | 29x | 22x | — |
| 2026E EPS growth | +18% | — | +9% |
| EPS contribution | 46% (2026E) | — | 54% (2026E) |

**Goldman Sachs projection:** Mag 7 EPS contribution falling from 50% (2025) → 46% (2026). S&P 493 earnings growth accelerating 7% → 9%.

**"I call it 'AI fatigue.' I'm tired of it and I suspect a lot of other people are wary of the whole issue."** — [[Ed Yardeni]] (Jan 2026)

### Rotation timing

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Oct 29, 2025** | S&P 500 record high — rotation begins |
| Late Oct | [[Michael Burry]] cryptic warning, shorts [[NVIDIA]] + [[Palantir]] |
| Nov 2025 | Mag 7 selloff, S&P 493 climbs |
| Dec 2025 | XMAG inflows 4x November |
| Jan 2026 | Tax-loss selling + AI fatigue accelerates |
| **Jan 14, 2026** | Russell 2000 beats S&P for 9th straight day |
| **Jan 15, 2026** | Russell 2000 beats S&P for **10th straight day — longest streak since 1990** |

### February 27, 2026 update — dispersion at 2009 extremes

**[[Citadel Securities]] data:** Single-stock dispersion at its highest since the 2009 GFC aftermath.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| S&P constituents moved ±20% YTD | **>20%** (risers ~2:1 over fallers) |
| S&P 500 YTD | ~Flat |
| Mag 7 YTD | **-5.6%** |
| S&P sectors up YTD | **7 of 11** |
| S&P stocks outperforming index | **60%+** (broadest in decades) |
| Active funds beating benchmark | **>50%** (highest in ~20 years) |
| Q4 2025 earnings growth YoY | **+12%** (4th straight double-digit quarter) |
| Revenue growth | **+9%** |
| Sectors with margin expansion | **7 of 11** |

**Earnings-driven market with suppressed index:** Revenue growing 9%, margins expanding broadly, 4th consecutive double-digit earnings quarter — but the index treads water because Mag 7 are dragging the cap-weighted benchmark. [[Société Générale|SocGen]]'s Manish Kabra: *"The macro message underlying the index is actually boom. Revenue is growing at 9 per cent. Seven out of 11 sectors have seen profit margin expansion."*

**"Violent rotations"** — [[Barclays]]' Venu Krishna on the rapid capital flight from tech to consumer durables and other sectors. *"This is yet another sign of the numerous micro-narratives playing out beneath subdued index volatility."*

**Active management revival:** The breadth of this market is rewarding stockpickers. More than half of large-cap mutual funds outperforming their benchmark — highest rate in almost two decades ([[Goldman Sachs]]). Active funds had lagged passive for years due to relentless Mag 7 gains. That concentration advantage has reversed.

**The Kabra framework:** In an earnings-driven market, index expectations should be muted. *"But once you mute down index excitement, internally, if it's earnings driven, there will be parts of the market that get phenomenal returns."* — This is the environment where thesis-driven picking matters most.

**Examples of extreme single-stock moves (Feb 2026):**

| Stock | Move | Catalyst |
|-------|------|----------|
| [[Deere]] | +10% | Strong earnings |
| [[Spotify]] | +15% (then -8% two days later) | 3x profit YoY, then profit-taking |
| Software sector | Broadly down | AI existential threat to SaaS |
| Logistics sector | Broadly down | AI disruption fears |

### January 15, 2026 update

**Historic small cap outperformance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Russell 2000 vs S&P streak | **10 days** (longest since 1990) |
| Russell 2000 YTD | **+7%** |
| S&P 500 YTD | +1.88% |
| Breadth | **77% of Russell 2000 constituents up** |
| Dec 2025 surge | +12%, crossed 2,600 |
| Monthly streak | 11 months of outperformance (since Feb 2025) |

**Key drivers:**
- **Fed rate cuts** reduced floating-rate debt costs (small caps carry more floating-rate debt)
- **Historically attractive valuations** after years of underperformance vs mega-cap tech
- Record intraday highs in each of past 10 sessions

### January 14, 2026 update

**Rotation accelerating:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| S&P 500 | -0.53% |
| [[Nasdaq]] | -1.0% |
| [[Nasdaq]] 100 | Worst decline in a month |
| Mag 7 | All seven down |
| S&P 500 breadth | 300+ stocks up despite index down |

**Key insight:** While [[Nasdaq]] 100 fell to monthly lows, over 300 S&P 500 constituents actually rose. Classic rotation signal — money leaving concentrated leaders, spreading to broader market.

NVIDIA -1.4%, Microsoft -2.4% led tech lower. Small caps continue outperforming.

### [[XMAG]] ETF (S&P 493 proxy)

**Defiance Large Cap Ex-Magnificent Seven ETF** — launched late 2024

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | XMAG |
| 2025 return | +15% |
| Inflow streak | 6 straight months (Jul-Dec 2025) |
| Dec inflows | 4x November (~$38M) |

**Monthly fund flows (2025):**

| Month | Flow | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Jan | ~$10M | |
| Feb | ~$5M | |
| Mar | ~$[[3M]] | |
| Apr | ~$2M | |
| May | ~$1M | |
| Jun | ~-$1M | Only outflow month |
| Jul | ~$1M | 6-month streak starts |
| Aug | ~$2M | |
| Sep | ~$4M | |
| Oct | ~$10M | Post-record pivot |
| Nov | ~$8M | |
| **Dec** | **~$38M** | 4x November |

**Pattern:** Rotation accelerated sharply in Q4 — Dec inflows nearly equal Jan-Nov combined.

### Flows

| Out of | Into |
|--------|------|
| Mag 7, high-growth tech | [[Defense]], small caps, financials |
| AI momentum plays | Industrials, utilities |
| Crowded mega-cap | Value, quality |

### Goldman Sachs sector picks (Jan 2026)

**Overweight:** Health care, materials, consumer discretionary, software & services

Rationale: Wide valuation spreads + favorable macro outlook for value.

### Drivers

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **AI ROI scrutiny** | Investors want returns, not capex promises |
| **Tax-delay selling** | Institutions deferred gains to 2026, sold Jan 2 |
| **Valuation reset** | Mag 7 at 29x vs historical avg |
| **Policy catalysts** | Trump defense budget, rate expectations |
| **Earnings broadening** | Growth differential narrowing |

### Analyst 12-month price targets (Jan 2026)

| Stock | [[Target]] | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | **+39%** | Highest upside, AI demand |
| [[Microsoft]] | +33% | Copilot monetization |
| [[Meta]] | +29% | Efficiency gains |
| [[Amazon]] | +21% | AWS + automation |
| [[Apple]] | +13% | Steady, "anti-AI" play |
| [[Google]] | +4% | Priced in after +65% in 2024 |
| [[Tesla]] | **-9%** | Only negative target |

### Historical Mag 7 annual returns (2021-2025)

| Stock | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | +125% | -50% | **+240%** | +170% | +35% |
| [[Tesla]] | +65% | -65% | +100% | -5% | +65% |
| [[Meta]] | +25% | -65% | +195% | +65% | +5% |
| [[Google]] | +65% | -40% | +60% | +65% | +5% |
| [[Microsoft]] | +50% | -30% | +55% | +10% | +15% |
| [[Amazon]] | +5% | -50% | +80% | +45% | +10% |
| [[Apple]] | +35% | -30% | +50% | +35% | +5% |
| **S&P 500** | +25% | -20% | +25% | +25% | +25% |

**Key pattern:**
- 2021, 2023, 2024: S&P 500 underperformed most Mag 7
- 2022: S&P 500 outperformed (everything crashed)
- **2025: S&P 500 outperformed several Mag 7** — rare outside of crashes

This is the rotation signal: when the index beats its biggest components, leadership is shifting.

### Winners (Jan 2026)

| Sector/Stock | Move | Catalyst |
|--------------|------|----------|
| [[Defense]] | +6-8% | Trump $1.5T budget |
| Russell 2000 | +6% vs [[Nasdaq]] | Small cap rotation |
| Financials | Outperforming | Rate cut expectations |

## Historical rotations

| Period | Rotation | Trigger | Sell side | Buy side | Duration |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **2026** | Software → Energy | [[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026\|SaaSpocalypse]], AI disruption | SaaS, software (IGV -25%) | Energy (XLE +18%), old economy | Ongoing |
| **2026** | Large → Small | AI disruption + valuation gap | Mag 7, Nasdaq | Russell 2000 (+7% YTD) | Ongoing |
| **2022** | Growth → Value | Fed hiking cycle | Unprofitable tech | Energy, financials | Full year |
| **2020-21** | Value → Growth | Covid, zero rates | Cyclicals | Stay-at-home tech | 18 months |
| **2018 Q4** | Risk-off | Fed overtightening fears | Everything | Treasuries, cash | 3 months |
| **2016** | Growth → Value | Trump election, reflation | Tech, bonds | Industrials, financials | 6 months |
| **2000-02** | Growth → Value | Dot-com bust | Tech, telecom | Energy, staples | 2+ years |
| **1973-74** | Growth → Value | Nifty Fifty collapse | Growth at any price | Value, commodities | 2 years |

**Pattern:** Energy shows up as a rotation beneficiary in 2000-02, 2022, and 2026 — every time a tech narrative breaks.

### 2000-02: Dot-com bust

![[rotation-2000-03-dotcom.png]]
*XLE (energy) vs QQQ (tech) 2000-02. QQQ fell ~70%, XLE held flat — ~70pp divergence. The original tech-to-energy rotation.*

### 2016: Trump election reflation

![[rotation-2016-trump.png]]
*QQQ vs XLE, Sep 2016 – May 2017. Energy surged +14% post-election on reflation trade, then rolled over as tech resumed leadership by spring 2017. Rotation lasted ~6 months.*

### 2018 Q4: Fed overtightening scare

![[rotation-2018-q4-riskoff.png]]
*SPY vs QQQ, Sep 2018 – Feb 2019. Not a classic rotation — everything sold off. QQQ hit -22%, SPY -15%. Both recovered by March. Risk-off, not reallocation.*

### 2020-21: COVID growth trade

![[rotation-2020-21-covid.png]]
*QQQ vs XLE, Mar 2020 – Nov 2021. QQQ +80%, XLE +35% — but XLE started from -50%. Stay-at-home tech dominated. Energy recovered but never caught up.*

### 2022: Fed hiking cycle

![[rotation-2022-fed-hike.png]]
*XLE vs QQQ, 2022. The sharpest rotation: XLE +55%, QQQ -30% — ~85pp divergence. Energy's best year in decades as Fed crushed growth multiples.*

### 2026: SaaSpocalypse

US energy sector +17% YTD. [[Exxon]], [[Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]] combined market cap +25% over 12 months. US oil majors trade at >75% forward EV/EBITDA premium to European peers ([[Shell]], [[BP]], [[TotalEnergies]]). Commodity is down ~10% over 12 months but stocks diverging upward — market repricing longevity, not current cash flows. [[IEA]] now sees [[Oil|oil demand]] potentially growing until 2050.

See [[AI workflow disruption basket]] for the sell side of this trade.

### Historical parallels to watch

**BCA Research warning:** Past concentrated bull markets (Nifty Fifty 1973, dot-com 2000) didn't transition peacefully — broader market retreated when leaders stumbled.

**"The most benign outcome would be a peaceful transfer of power to a broad coalition of the other 493. That's not how potent and highly concentrated bull markets typically evolve."** — Doug Peta, BCA Research

**Risk:** New leadership may not emerge until US equities suffer a meaningful bear market.

## Indicators to watch

| Indicator | [[Signal]] |
|-----------|--------|
| **Growth vs Value relative P/E** | Stretched = rotation risk |
| **Earnings growth differential** | Narrowing = broadening |
| **Fund flows** | Tech outflows, value/small inflows |
| **Russell 2000 / [[Nasdaq]] ratio** | Rising = small cap leadership |
| **Sector ETF relative strength** | [[XLF]], XLI outperforming XLK |
| **[[Breadth divergence]]** | Index down but majority of stocks up = rotation (not selloff) |

### Rotation signature pattern

**The key distinction:** In a broad selloff, most stocks fall together. In a rotation, the index can fall while most constituents rise — capital leaving concentrated leaders spreads to the rest.

| Scenario | Index | Breadth | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Broad selloff** | Down | Most stocks down | Risk-off, reduce exposure |
| **Rotation** | Down | Most stocks up | Leadership change, reposition |
| **Healthy rally** | Up | Most stocks up | Broad participation |
| **Narrow rally** | Up | Few stocks up | Fragile, concentration risk |

**Jan 14, 2026 example:** S&P 500 -0.53%, [[Nasdaq]] -1.0%, but 300+ S&P constituents rose. This is rotation, not a selloff — money is moving, not leaving.

---

## How long does current rotation last?

| Scenario | Duration | Catalyst to watch |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Tax selling only** | 2-4 weeks | Fades after Jan |
| **Valuation reset** | 1-2 quarters | Q4 earnings (late Jan) |
| **Secular shift** | Full year+ | AI ROI evidence, Fed policy |

---

## Implications for theses

| Thesis | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| [[Long NVIDIA]] | Near-term pressure, structural intact |
| [[Long defense AI]] | Validating — rotation INTO defense |
| [[AI hyperscalers]] | ROI scrutiny, but demand real |
