# Dollar reserve status erosion

The US dollar's share of global foreign currency reserves has declined from **~65% (2000) to ~41% (2025)** — a 24 percentage point drop over 25 years, with the decline accelerating sharply post-2022.

## The acceleration (2022-2026)

The decline was gradual for two decades (~65% → ~55%), then fell off a cliff. The inflection point was clear: **February 2022**, when the US and allies froze ~$300B in Russian central bank reserves after the Ukraine invasion.

This told every central bank on Earth: dollar reserves can be weaponized. Countries that might one day find themselves on the wrong side of US foreign policy began diversifying urgently.

## Five forces driving the decline

### 1. Weaponization of the dollar
Freezing Russia's reserves was unprecedented — a nuclear option that fundamentally changed the calculus. [[China]] (~$3T in reserves), [[Saudi Arabia]], India, and others saw their own vulnerability. The message: dollar reserves are only safe if you stay aligned with Washington.

### 2. Central bank gold accumulation
Central banks bought record gold in 2022 (~1,136 tonnes), 2023 (~1,037t), and 2024 (~1,000t+). [[China]]'s PBOC, Poland, Turkey, and India were the largest buyers. Gold can't be frozen, sanctioned, or debased by fiscal policy.

### 3. Bilateral trade in local currencies
- **China-Russia**: trade settled in yuan/rubles since 2022
- **China-Saudi Arabia**: yuan-denominated oil sales (the "petroyuan")
- **India-Russia**: rupee/ruble settlements for oil
- **BRICS**: push for common settlement mechanisms, New Development Bank lending in local currencies
- **China-Brazil**: direct BRL/CNY trade settlement

### 4. US fiscal credibility erosion
- National debt >$35T, debt/GDP >120%
- Persistent deficits (~$2T/yr)
- Repeated debt ceiling crises (2011, 2023) shake confidence
- Interest payments approaching $1T/yr — becoming the largest federal expenditure

### 5. Sanctions overuse
Every new sanctions regime — Iran, Russia, Venezuela, now [[Chile]] officials over cables — incentivizes targets and bystanders to build non-dollar infrastructure. The more the dollar is used as a weapon, the more countries invest in alternatives.

## What's replacing it

| Currency/Asset | Share of reserves | Trend |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| **USD** | ~41% | Declining sharply |
| **Euro** | ~20% | Stable |
| **Gold** | Growing (non-currency) | Record central bank buying |
| **Yuan (CNY)** | ~2-3% | Growing slowly, capital controls limit uptake |
| **Yen** | ~5% | Stable |
| **GBP** | ~5% | Stable |
| **Other** | ~25% | AUD, CAD, CHF, SEK — fragmenting |

The key insight: the dollar isn't being replaced by one alternative — it's being replaced by **many**. The shift is from dollar hegemony to a multi-polar reserve system. No single currency needs to challenge the dollar; they just collectively reduce its share.

## Why it matters for markets

- **Gold**: structural bid from central banks diversifying reserves — bullish
- **US Treasuries**: lower foreign demand at the margin → higher yields → higher borrowing costs
- **Dollar index**: long-term weakening pressure, though can still strengthen cyclically (rate differentials)
- **Commodities**: if priced less exclusively in dollars, commodities could decouple from USD movements
- **Emerging markets**: benefit from reduced dollar dependency and local currency borrowing
- **US exorbitant privilege**: America's ability to borrow cheaply in its own currency, run persistent deficits, and fund military spending through foreign savings — all depend on reserve status

## The counterpoint

41% is still dominant — nothing else is close. The yuan is at 2-3% and constrained by capital controls. The euro has no fiscal union behind it. Crypto is negligible. The dollar still denominates ~88% of FX transactions and ~40% of international trade. Reserve status erodes slowly, then quickly — but we may still be in the "slowly" phase.

The real risk isn't replacement — it's **marginal diversification**. If central banks shift from 60% USD to 40% USD, that's $2-3T in selling over a decade. Not catastrophic, but it means the US can't take infinite demand for Treasuries for granted.
