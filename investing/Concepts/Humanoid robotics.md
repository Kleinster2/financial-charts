## Cost curve

| Year | Price range | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 2023 | $50K-$250K | Research prototypes |
| 2024 | $30K-$150K | 40% cost drop (Goldman) |
| 2025 | ~$35K avg | First commercial deployments |
| 2026 | $20K-$50K | Scale production begins |
| 2030 | ~$17K | 51% reduction from 2025 (BoA) |

Cost declining faster than expected — 40% drop 2023→2024 vs. projected 15-20% annual.

## Key players

| Company | Model | Price | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| [[Tesla]] | Optimus | $25-30K target | Factory deployment, 5-10K units 2025 |
| [[Boston Dynamics]] | Atlas | <$320K | [[Hyundai]] ownership brings auto supply chain |
| [[Figure AI]] | Figure 02 | $30-50K est | $39B valuation (Sep 2025) |
| Unitree | G1 | $13,500 | Cheapest full-featured |
| 1X | NEO | $20K / $499/mo | Deliveries 2026 |

## Cost breakdown

| Component | Share | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actuators & motors | 40-50% | Largest cost driver |
| Sensors & vision | 15-20% | LiDAR, depth cameras |
| Compute | 10-15% | On-board AI |
| Frame & structure | 10-15% | |

**Hyundai advantage:** Parts costing $1,000 in robotics cost $100 in automotive due to volume. Atlas benefits from auto supply chain.
