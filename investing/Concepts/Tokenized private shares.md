**Tokenized private shares** — Using blockchain tokens to give retail investors "exposure" to private companies like OpenAI and [[SpaceX]]. Not actual equity — side bets on company performance.

---

## The thesis

Tokenization democratizes access to private company upside:

| Traditional | Tokenized |
|-------------|-----------|
| Accredited investors only | Retail accessible |
| High minimums ($100K+) | Low minimums |
| Illiquid | Tradeable on crypto rails |
| Actual equity | Derivative exposure |
| Shareholder rights | No voting/dividends |

**Promise:** Get in early on wealth creation, not just at IPO exhaust.

---

## How it works

Tokens are **not actual equity** — they're derivative instruments:

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Ownership | No — "side bet" on performance |
| Voting rights | No |
| Dividends | No |
| Company endorsement | Usually no |
| IPO convergence | Should converge at liquidity event |

**Key quote:** "It's a side bet with the issuer of the token."

## Current platforms

| Platform | Offering |
|----------|----------|
| **[[Robinhood]]** | Tokenized OpenAI, [[SpaceX]] shares ([[Europe]], June 2025) |
| **[[Republic]]** | [[SpaceX]] token |
| Various crypto | Multiple private company tokens |

**OpenAI response:** Publicly said it did not endorse Robinhood's move.

## Why private companies matter

**Private equity has outperformed public markets for 25 years.**

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| [[Google]] early | $100K valuation → multi-trillion |
| Retail access | Only at IPO (when insiders cash out) |
| Best companies | Don't need retail capital |
| Adverse selection | Great companies don't offer secondary |

**The problem:** Retail gets "the exhaust" — insiders built wealth, then IPO to cash out.

---

## Why companies stay private

Reasons to avoid going public:
- Disclosure requirements (Securities Act of 1933)
- Periodic SEC filings
- Corporate governance costs
- Short-term market pressure
- Loss of control

**Result:** Best companies stay private longer → retail locked out of growth phase.

---

## Regulatory landscape

**Current state:** Regulations haven't caught up with innovation.

| Regulator | Stance |
|-----------|--------|
| SEC Chair Atkins | Pro-innovation, wants transparency |
| Traditional rules | Designed to protect unsophisticated investors |
| Crypto space | "Sometimes reinventing the wheel, sometimes reinventing fraud" |

**Risk:** Easy to sell dreams to unsophisticated investors without disclosure.

## Bull case

- Democratizes access to frontier AI/tech
- Private equity returns historically superior
- Technology enables efficient trading
- Retail deserves upside, not just IPO exhaust
- "Tokenization will be the layer behind everything"

---

## Bear case

- Not actual equity — no legal rights
- No disclosure requirements
- Company doesn't endorse/control
- Unknown unknowns (new tech, untested law)
- Fraudsters could exploit unsophisticated investors
- Adverse selection problem

**Warren Buffett rule:** Don't invest in anything you don't understand.

---

## Key questions before investing

1. What am I buying?
2. Who am I buying it from?
3. What rights do I have?
4. How does it converge at IPO?

If you can't answer these, stay away.

## Relevant private companies

| Company | Valuation | Token status |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| [[OpenAI]] | ~$500B (seeking) | Robinhood [[Europe]] |
| [[SpaceX]] | ~$350B+ | Republic, Robinhood |
| [[Anthropic]] | ~$60B | Not yet tokenized |
| [[Databricks]] | ~$60B | Not yet tokenized |

---

## Investment angle

**Not recommending tokenized shares** — but the trend signals:
- Retail demand for private AI exposure is massive
- Traditional structures failing to meet demand
- Regulatory change likely coming
- IPO pipeline may accelerate if tokenization legitimized

**Watch:** SEC rulemaking on tokenization framework.
