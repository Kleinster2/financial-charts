**New York City budget** — NYC's FY2026 proposed budget of $127B represents expenditures comparable to a mid-sized nation (Greece, Thailand). Nearly doubled from ~$70B (Bloomberg's last budget, FY2014) in little more than a decade — faster than inflation and faster than the city's economic growth. Population declined 5% from Apr 2020 to Jul 2022 and remained below the 2020 baseline as of 2024, meaning fewer people splitting a larger bill.

## Budget trajectory

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 proposed budget | $127B |
| Bloomberg's last budget (FY2014) | ~$70B |
| Growth | ~2x in ~decade |
| Growth rate | Faster than inflation and city GDP |
| Mayor | [[Zohran Mamdani]] |

Per capita general spending (2023, Lincoln Institute fiscally standardized numbers): 30%+ higher than [[Los Angeles]], more than double Houston.

## Tax burden

NYC sits at the extreme end of the American tax spectrum.

| Tax | Rate / level |
|-----|-------------|
| Combined state + city top income tax | 14.776% |
| Combined marginal rate (high earners) | >50%, ~55% on investment income |
| Combined corporate tax rate | 17.44% — highest in US (Citizen's Budget Commission) |
| Property tax share of ownership cost | >27% (2022), above national average |

Mamdani proposes further income/corporate tax hikes, or a ~10% property tax increase.

European-level tax rates without European-level services (no universal healthcare, free college, or comparable infrastructure).

## Education spending

NYC DOE is the largest school district in the country.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DOE budget (2019) | ~$34B |
| DOE budget (current) | >$40B |
| Per-pupil spending (projected FY2026) | ~$35,000 — among highest nationally |
| Enrollment trend | Shrinking |
| Outcomes | Middling graduation rates, test scores, reading levels |

Budget climbed while enrollment shrank. Per-pupil spending among the highest in the nation; outputs comparable to districts spending a fraction as much.

## Population and the per-capita squeeze

| Period | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Apr 2020 – Jul 2022 | -5% |
| As of 2024 | Still below 2020 baseline |

Fewer residents bearing a larger fiscal burden. The arithmetic: a growing bill divided among fewer payers.

## Rental assistance

City rental assistance spending: $263M (FY2020) → $1.34B (most recent FY) — a 5x increase. Housing costs worsened over the same period. See [[NYC real estate]] for the subsidy trap dynamics.

## Analysis

The NYC budget exhibits the core [[Blue city fiscal crisis]] pattern: spending growth decoupled from economic growth and population, rising per-capita burden, and subsidy-driven programs that fail to improve outcomes. The education data is particularly stark — a $6B+ budget increase paired with enrollment decline and flat-to-middling results. The tax structure, already at the US extreme, faces proposed further increases, which risk accelerating the domestic outmigration that drove the post-2020 population decline.

The fiscal trajectory makes NYC housing unaffordability self-reinforcing: higher taxes → higher cost of living → outmigration → smaller tax base → pressure for more tax increases.
