# Electrostate

A society that consumes a high proportion of its energy in electrical form, regardless of how that electricity is generated. Coined/popularized by [[Adam Tooze]] to describe the emerging divide in global energy systems between electrified economies (China) and fossil-dependent ones (US as "petrostate").

## The framing

The electrostate concept separates two dimensions of energy transition:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Electrification** | What share of energy consumption is electrical? |
| **Decarbonization** | How clean are electricity sources? |

A country can decarbonize its grid (green power) without electrifying its economy (still burning gas for heat, gasoline for transport). [[Europe]] did this—top-left quadrant. Or a country can electrify massively while the grid remains dirty, then clean it up. China did this—moved right first, then up.

**The key insight:** Climate stabilization requires both. But electrification is the precondition—you can only decarbonize energy that flows through the grid.

## China as archetype

China is the paradigmatic electrostate:

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| EV penetration | Near-universal in cities like Chengdu |
| Solar panel production | 1,200 GW/year capacity (vs US 250 GW total installed) |
| Urban buildout | 90% of habitations built since 1990—all electrified from start |
| Grid infrastructure | Ultra-high voltage transmission from west to east |

Tooze's visceral description: Standing at a Chengdu crosswalk, ~100 vehicles pass in 30 seconds without him noticing—all electric, producing only tire noise. "Like a silent disco."

## US as "petrostate"

The US is framed as an electrostate's opposite—not because it lacks electricity, but because:

1. **Fracking solved energy security** — Shale gas/oil answered the national security question without requiring electrification
2. **Gas remade the grid** — Fracking drove coal-to-gas switching, not coal-to-renewables
3. **[[Transport]] remains fossil** — EV adoption lags China dramatically
4. **Political economy** — Fossil interests front-footed, not rear-guard

"Fracking is the story of the American electrostate in the 2010s"—but it's an electrostate powered by gas, not renewables.

## [[Europe]]'s failure

[[Europe]] drove decarbonization but not electrification:

| Action | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Feed-in tariffs | Created solar market, surrendered to China |
| Carbon pricing | Took 15 years to work |
| Nuclear phase-out | Extended coal protection instead |
| [[Diesel]] focus | Delayed [[EV transition]] |

Result: Top-left quadrant (green power, low electrification) instead of top-right (green + electrified).

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Positioning |
|----------|-------------|
| Electrostate wins | Long EV supply chain, grid infrastructure, battery storage |
| Petrostate persists | Long US shale, [[LNG]] exporters |
| Convergence (Gulf model) | Long both—AI chips + Chinese solar meeting in Emirates |

The Gulf states represent a strange synthesis: using oil wealth to buy Chinese solar panels to power American AI chips.
