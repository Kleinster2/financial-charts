**Platinum** — industrial precious metal, primarily used in catalytic converters, jewelry, and industrial applications. Historically traded at a premium to gold, now at a steep discount.

## Key dynamics

### Supply concentration

| Country | Share |
|---------|-------|
| South [[Africa]] | ~70% |
| Russia | ~12% |
| Zimbabwe | ~8% |

South African supply dominates — vulnerable to power outages (Eskom), labor strikes, and mining costs.

### Demand breakdown

| Use | Share |
|-----|-------|
| Autocatalysts | ~40% |
| Jewelry | ~25% |
| Industrial | ~20% |
| Investment | ~10% |

**Autocatalyst context:** Platinum is used in diesel catalytic converters. [[Diesel]]'s decline in [[Europe]] has pressured demand.

### Platinum-palladium substitution

Historically, platinum and palladium were interchangeable in catalytic converters:
- Palladium preferred for gasoline engines
- Platinum preferred for diesel engines

When palladium spiked to $3,000/oz (2022), automakers began substituting platinum:
- Platinum now ~$950/oz vs palladium ~$950/oz (converging)
- Substitution takes 2-3 years to implement in new vehicle models
- Some switching already underway

### EV transition headwind

Electric vehicles don't need catalytic converters — structural headwind for both platinum and palladium. But:
- Hybrid vehicles still need catalysts
- Transition slower than expected
- Platinum has hydrogen fuel cell upside (PEM electrolyzers)

### Gold-platinum ratio

| Era | Ratio | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Historical avg | 0.8-1.0x | Platinum at premium |
| 2015-2020 | 1.5-2.0x | [[Diesel]] scandal, palladium substitution |
| Current | ~2.2x | Platinum deeply discounted |

Platinum trading at historic discount to gold — mean reversion thesis or structural shift?
