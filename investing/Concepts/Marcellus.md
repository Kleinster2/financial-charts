**Marcellus** — Largest natural gas-producing formation in the United States. Devonian-age shale spanning Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and New York. Produces ~30 Bcf/d (~35% of US gas output). Key operators include [[EQT]], [[Range Resources]], and [[Coterra Energy]]. Sandstone shale geology — contrasts with the carbonate unconventional approach at [[Jafurah]].
