# Brazil fintech

**World's most advanced fintech market** — Pix (87% adult adoption), neobank explosion, regulatory innovation. Brazil leapfrogged traditional payments infrastructure — mobile banking adoption (90%) exceeds US (75%). [[Nubank]] became LatAm's most valuable bank. Central Bank as unlikely fintech champion.

## Why Brazil fintech matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mobile banking adoption | **90%** (vs 56% in 2020) |
| Pix users | **182M+** (87% of adults) |
| Pix transactions (2024) | 64B (+53% YoY) |
| Largest neobank | [[Nubank]] (100M+ customers, ~$60B mkt cap) |
| New banking customers via Pix | **17M** previously unbanked |

Brazil's fintech revolution is the model for emerging market digital finance.

## Pix: The game changer

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Launch | November 2020 |
| Users | 182M+ |
| Daily transactions | 175M+ |
| vs Cards | Surpassed debit + credit combined by **80%** |
| Cost to merchants | **Free** (vs 2-3% card fees) |

### Why Pix won

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Free for consumers** | No fees for P2P or purchases |
| **Instant** | Real-time 24/7/365 |
| **Universal** | Works across all banks |
| **Simple** | QR code or phone number |
| **Central Bank mandate** | All banks required to offer |

### Pix evolution

| Date | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Nov 2020 | Launch — instant P2P transfers |
| 2021-22 | QR code payments at merchants |
| Feb 2025 | **Pix por Aproximação** — contactless NFC |
| Jun 2025 | **Pix Automático** — recurring payments |
| 2026 | Pix Crédito (credit line integration) planned |

**Threat to cards:** Visa/Mastercard losing share in Brazil as Pix dominates. Card networks pivoting to credit (where Pix doesn't compete... yet).

## Neobank landscape

| Company | Customers | Valuation/Mkt Cap | Status | Differentiator |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| [[Nubank]] | 100M+ | ~$60B | Public (NU) | Scale, brand, LatAm expansion |
| [[Inter]] | 30M+ | ~$3B | Public | Super-app model |
| [[C6 Bank]] | 30M+ | ~$11B | Private | [[JPMorgan]] backing, Conta Global |
| [[BTG Pactual]] digital | Growing | ~$35B (total) | Public | Investment bank going retail |
| PagBank ([[PagSeguro]]) | 30M+ | ~$4B | Public | Merchant-to-consumer |
| [[Banco Original]] | 6M+ | Private | Private | Fintech pioneer (2011) |

### The big 3 traditional banks

| Bank | Mkt Cap | Digital response |
|------|---------|------------------|
| [[Itaú Unibanco]] | ~$50B | Iti (digital wallet), acquiring fintechs |
| [[Bradesco]] | ~$25B | Next (digital bank), struggling vs neobanks |
| [[Banco do Brasil]] | ~$25B | Government-owned, slow to adapt |

**Traditional banks' problem:** Legacy cost structures (~5% cost-to-income disadvantage), branch networks, older customer base.

## Payments stack

| Layer | Players |
|-------|---------|
| **Instant payments** | Pix (Central Bank) |
| **Acquirers** | [[StoneCo]], PagSeguro, Cielo, Rede |
| **Card networks** | Visa, Mastercard, Elo (domestic) |
| **Neobanks** | Nubank, Inter, C6, BTG |
| **Traditional banks** | Itaú, Bradesco, BB, Santander |

### Acquirer wars

| Company | Ticker | Focus | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| [[StoneCo]] | STNE | SMB merchants | Premium service, higher take rate |
| [[PagSeguro]] | PAGS | Micro-merchants | Hardware focus (maquininhas) |
| Cielo | CIEL3.SA | Enterprise | Itaú/Bradesco JV, losing share |
| Rede | — | Enterprise | Itaú-owned |
| GetNet | — | Enterprise | Santander-owned |

StoneCo and PagSeguro disrupted Cielo's duopoly — now Pix disrupting all of them.

| **Interchange caps** | Pressure on card fees |

**Roberto Campos Neto** (BCB Governor 2019-2024): Architect of Pix, open banking. Made Brazil the fintech model.
