## 2026 outlook

**Price forecasts:**

| Source | [[Target]] |
|--------|--------|
| Ganfeng Lithium (chairman) | 150,000-200,000 CNY/t (+30-40% demand growth) |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | $13,250/t avg, rising to $17,077 by 2028 |
| Analyst range | $12,000-17,000/t |
| Bull case | $28,000/t if demand surges |

## Supply/demand balance

**Shifting to deficit:**

| Year | Balance |
|------|---------|
| 2023 | Surplus 175,000t |
| 2024 | Surplus 154,000t |
| 2025 | Small surplus |
| **2026** | **Deficit ~1,500t** (Fastmarkets) |

**Supply response:**
- [[China]] canceling mining permits (Yichun: 27 permits)
- High-cost mines shutting
- Government preventing deflationary pressures

## EV demand drivers

**Global EV market:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 EV sales | 20M+ units (~25% of new cars) |
| 2025 growth | +27% |
| 2026 forecast | 25M+ units |
| 2030 forecast | 50M+ units |

**Battery costs:**
- 2026 pack price: ~$105/kWh (down 3%)
- LFP (lithium iron phosphate) gaining share
- [[China]] manufacturing glut pressuring prices

---

## Energy storage — fastest growing

**[[Grid storage]] emerging:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 storage growth | +44% (vs +25% total battery) |
| Storage share of demand | ~25% of global battery demand |
| [[China]] charging capacity | Doubling to 180 GW by 2027 |

Energy storage becoming as important as EVs for lithium demand.

---

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- Deficit starting 2026
- EV adoption accelerating (25M+ units 2026)
- Energy storage +44% growth
- Supply discipline ([[China]] permit cancellations)
- Rebounding from oversold levels

**Bear case:**
- [[China]] controls processing/refining
- LFP uses less lithium than NMC
- [[Battery recycling]] increasing
- Oversupply risk if mines restart
- Price still well below 2022 highs

**ETFs:**

| Ticker | Name | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| LIT | Global X Lithium & Battery Tech | Broad exposure |
| BATT | Amplify Lithium & Battery Tech | Battery value chain |

**Miners:**

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Albemarle]] | ALB | \#1 Western producer, +74% in 2025 |
| [[SQM]] | SQM | Chilean brine, Atacama |
| Livent | LTHM | Pure-play lithium |
| Piedmont Lithium | PLL | US development |

## Supply chain

**Geographic concentration:**

| Stage | Dominant |
|-------|----------|
| Mining | [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]] |
| Refining | **[[China]] (~60%+)** |
| Battery production | **[[China]] (~75%)** |

[[China]] dominates midstream/downstream — geopolitical risk.
