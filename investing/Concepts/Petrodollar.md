**Petrodollar** — System where oil is priced and traded in USD. Underpins dollar's reserve currency status. Under pressure from BRICS de-dollarization efforts.

## How petrodollar works

**The cycle:**
1. Oil globally priced in USD
2. Oil importers must hold dollars
3. Exporters receive dollars, recycle into US assets
4. Supports US Treasury demand and dollar value

**Origins (1970s):**
- US-Saudi deal after 1973 embargo
- Saudi prices oil in USD, buys US weapons/Treasuries
- Other OPEC members followed
- Became global standard

## Why it matters

| Benefit to US | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Reserve currency | Lower borrowing costs |
| Sanctions power | Dollar access as weapon |
| Trade advantage | No FX risk on oil imports |
| Treasury demand | Recycled petrodollars |

**Scale:** ~100M bpd global oil trade × $60-80/bbl = ~$2-3T annual flows

## De-dollarization threats

**BRICS efforts:**
- China buying oil in yuan (from Russia, Saudi, Iran)
- Russia-India rupee settlements
- Saudi considering yuan pricing
- BRICS currency discussions

**Progress:**
| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Russia-China yuan oil | Active |
| Saudi-China yuan oil | Small volumes |
| BRICS currency | Discussed, not implemented |
| Dollar share of reserves | Declining slowly (60% → 58%) |

See [[BRICS]] for context.

## Investment implications

**If petrodollar weakens:**
- USD faces long-term headwind
- US Treasuries less automatic bid
- Gold/commodities as alternatives
- Non-US energy companies benefit

**If petrodollar holds:**
- Dollar dominance continues
- US sanctions remain potent
- Status quo for energy markets

**Timeline:** Gradual erosion, not sudden collapse. Decades-long trend.

## Saudi's pivotal role

**Saudi choices matter:**
- Largest OPEC exporter
- Original petrodollar partner
- Flirting with yuan pricing
- Still majority in USD

**Watch for:** Saudi pricing any oil in non-USD = major signal.

## Venezuela connection

**Post-Maduro:**
- US control = oil stays in dollars
- Prevents Venezuela joining de-dollarization
- Reinforces petrodollar in hemisphere

See [[Monroe Doctrine]] and [[Venezuela oil rebuild]].
