# AI disintermediation

AI is collapsing the value of intermediation — businesses that sit between a buyer and a product/service, earning fees on information asymmetry, comparison complexity, or advisory work. Three events in eight days in February 2026 made this thesis concrete and tradeable.

## The pattern

| Step | Pre-AI | Post-AI |
|------|--------|---------|
| Information gathering | Middleman aggregates options | AI scans all options instantly |
| Comparison | Middleman evaluates and recommends | AI compares on every dimension simultaneously |
| Advisory | Middleman provides judgment | AI provides data-driven recommendations |
| Execution | Middleman handles paperwork/process | AI automates workflow end-to-end |
| Value capture | Commission/fee on transaction | Collapses toward zero for routine work |

The middleman's margin is a function of complexity and opacity. AI reduces both.

## February 2026: the thesis went live

### Week 1: Software middlemen (Feb 3-8)

[[Claude Cowork disruption February 2026|SaaSpocalypse]] — [[Anthropic]]'s Cowork plugins targeted legal, sales, marketing, and data workflows. $611B erased from software/services stocks. The victims were information intermediaries: [[Thomson Reuters]] (legal data), [[RELX]] (analytics), [[FactSet]] (financial data), [[Morningstar]] (investment research).

### Week 2: Insurance middlemen (Feb 9)

[[Insurify insurance broker selloff February 2026|Insurify selloff]] — [[Insurify]]'s ChatGPT app enabled AI-powered insurance comparison inside a 300M-user platform. Insurance brokers sold off: [[Willis Towers Watson]] -12%, [[Arthur J. Gallagher]] -9.9%, [[Aon]] -9.3%. The carriers (who manufacture the product) were relatively spared.

### Week 2 continued: Wealth management middlemen (Feb 10)

[[Altruist wealth management selloff February 2026|Altruist selloff]] — [[Altruist]]'s Hazel AI tax planning tool commoditized one of the highest-value advisory services. Wealth management stocks sold off: [[Raymond James]] -8.5%, [[LPL Financial]] -8.4%, [[Charles Schwab]] -8.1%, [[Stifel Financial]] -7.2%.

### Week 2 continued: Financial data middlemen (Feb 11)

**Dealogic/Mergermarket bonds hit by AI fears** — [[ION Group]]'s bonds — parent of financial data providers [[Dealogic]] and [[Mergermarket]] — sold off as AI tools threaten to replicate deal intelligence and M&A data products. Dealogic provides deal league tables, origination data, and analytics to the top 50 investment banks. Mergermarket provides predictive M&A intelligence. Both are classic information intermediaries. ION Group's leveraged debt structure makes it particularly vulnerable if revenue comes under pressure. The AI narrative complicates ION's planned refinancing of expensive private debt.

### Week 2 continued: Industrial software (Feb 11)

[[Dassault Systèmes]] crashed 18-21% after weak Q4 + soft 2026 guide — worst day in company history, ~€6B wiped. The biggest European SaaSpocalypse casualty. Down >50% over 12 months. JPMorgan: "worse than even the most negative had feared." Industrial software (CAD/PLM/simulation) faces the same AI replacement logic as legal/financial data software.

### Week 2 continued: European wealth management (Feb 11)

[[St. James's Place]] (UK's largest wealth manager, £220B FUM) sold off on AI disruption fears — the Altruist selloff pattern crossing the Atlantic. Not just SJP — [[Quilter]] (-5%), [[AJ Bell]] (-6.5%), [[Rathbones]] (-4%), and European peers [[DWS]], [[Julius Baer]], [[Swissquote]], [[FinecoBank]] all fell. Irony: SJP's actual FY2025 was strong (net inflows +42%, profits +40%, record FUM). Counter-thesis: UK regulatory moat + 94.9% retention.

### The common thread

All events hit the distribution/advisory/middleware layer, not the production/execution layer. SaaS companies that aggregate/present data got crushed; the underlying databases survived. Insurance brokers who compare/advise got crushed; the underwriters survived. Wealth managers got crushed; pure execution platforms like [[Interactive Brokers]] (IBKR, +15% YTD) were immune.

## Vulnerable intermediaries

| Sector | Middleman | AI threat | Status |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Software/data | [[Thomson Reuters]], [[RELX]], [[FactSet]] | Cowork plugins replace research workflows | Selloff occurred (Feb 3-8) |
| Insurance broking | [[Marsh McLennan]], [[Aon]], [[Willis Towers Watson]] | AI comparison apps replace advisory | Selloff occurred (Feb 9) |
| Wealth management | [[Charles Schwab]], [[Raymond James]], [[LPL Financial]] | AI tax planning/advisory commoditization | Selloff occurred (Feb 10) |
| Advertising | [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]] | AI creates campaigns directly | Hit in SaaSpocalypse |
| IT consulting | [[Infosys]], [[TCS]], [[Accenture]] | AI automates implementation work | Hit in SaaSpocalypse |
| Real estate | Brokers/agents | AI comparison, virtual tours, automated transactions | Partial (Zillow/Redfin era) |
| **Financial data** | [[Dealogic]], [[Mergermarket]], [[ION Group]] | AI replicates deal intel, M&A data, league tables | **Bond selloff (Feb 11)** |
| **Industrial software** | [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[PTC]], [[Autodesk]] | AI generates 3D models, automates simulation/PLM | **DSY -18% (Feb 11)** |
| **European wealth mgmt** | [[St. James's Place]], [[Quilter]], [[AJ Bell]], [[Rathbones]], [[Julius Baer]] | AI tax planning, portfolio construction | **Selloff (Feb 11)** |
| Recruiting | Staffing agencies | AI matching, screening, outreach | Early stage |
| Financial advisory | Wealth managers, RIAs | AI portfolio construction, tax optimization | Robo-advisors + AI agents |
| Travel | OTAs, travel agents | AI trip planning, booking agents | Ongoing since 2000s |

## What survives

Not all intermediation is vulnerable. The defensible layers:

| Moat | Example | Why AI can't replace (yet) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Regulatory license | Insurance broker licenses, fiduciary duties | Legal requirement for human sign-off |
| Relationship complexity | Bespoke commercial insurance programs | Multi-party negotiation, trust |
| Liability bearing | Errors & omissions coverage | Someone must be accountable |
| Physical presence | Real estate showings, medical exams | Requires embodiment |
| Judgment under uncertainty | Complex claims, litigation strategy | Stakes too high for AI-only |

The pattern: routine intermediation dies, complex intermediation survives but faces margin compression.

## Investment implications

Short the middlemen (with caveats):
- Personal lines insurance brokers > commercial lines brokers
- Data aggregators > primary data creators
- Routine consulting > complex advisory
- The [[AI workflow disruption basket]] tracks many of these

Long the platforms:
- [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Google]] — the app directories where AI middlemen live
- [[Insurify]] (private) — first mover in insurance AI distribution

Long the execution infrastructure:
- [[Interactive Brokers]] (IBKR, +15% YTD through all three shocks) — pure execution platform with no advisory pretension. The market is pricing destruction of advisory margins specifically, not brokerage/custody infrastructure.
- Insurance carriers ([[Progressive]], [[Chubb]]) — product manufacturers, not distribution middlemen

Long the producers:
- Primary data sources — court records, patent filings, sensor data
- Regulated entities with compliance moats

## Historical precedent

| Era | Middleman disrupted | Disruptor | Outcome |
|-----|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| 1990s | Stockbrokers (full-service) | E*Trade, Schwab | Commissions: $50 → $0 |
| 2000s | Travel agents | Expedia, Kayak | Agency count -60% |
| 2010s | Taxi dispatchers | Uber, Lyft | Medallion values collapsed |
| 2020s | Real estate agents | Zillow, Redfin | Commission compression (NAR settlement) |
| 2026 | Software/data middlemen | [[Anthropic]] Cowork | -$611B in one week |
| 2026 | Insurance brokers | [[Insurify]] / ChatGPT | S&P Insurance -3.9% in one day |
| 2026 | Wealth managers | [[Altruist]] Hazel AI | SCHW -8%, RJF -8.5% in one day |
| 2026 | Financial data providers | AI deal intel tools | [[ION Group]] bonds sell off (Feb 11) |
| 2026 | Industrial software | AI CAD/PLM/simulation | [[Dassault Systèmes]] -18% (Feb 11) |
| 2026 | European wealth mgmt | [[Altruist]] Hazel AI contagion | [[St. James's Place]] selloff (Feb 11) |

Each wave follows the same arc: technology makes comparison free → incumbents lose pricing power → margins compress → industry consolidates.

## Counter-thesis

- Enterprise inertia — large corporations change vendors slowly. Multi-year contracts, switching costs, integration complexity.
- Complexity moat — the hardest 20% of advisory work may be unautomatable and worth more as routine work disappears.
- Regulatory capture — licensed professions can lobby for human-in-the-loop requirements.
- Trust premium — for high-stakes decisions (major insurance programs, M&A advisory), humans may always command a premium.
