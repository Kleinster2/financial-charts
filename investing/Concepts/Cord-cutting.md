# Cord-cutting

The structural decline of traditional pay TV (cable, satellite) as consumers shift to streaming services.

---

## Scale of decline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peak US pay TV subs | ~100M (2012) |
| Current (2025) | ~65M |
| Annual decline | **5-7%** |
| Projection (2030) | ~40M |

---

## Acceleration drivers

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Streaming maturity** | Netflix, Disney+, etc. now have scale |
| **Price increases** | Cable bills $150+/month |
| **Generational shift** | Under-35s never subscribed |
| **Sports unbundling** | ESPN DTC, sports on streaming |
| **Broadband-only** | Same providers, no TV |

## Who's hurt

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Comcast]] | Cable networks spinning off |
| [[Paramount Global]] | CBS, cable networks declining |
| [[Warner Bros Discovery]] | CNN, Discovery networks bleeding |

## Cable bundle economics

| Factor | Traditional | Post-cord-cutting |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ARPU | $150+/month | $15-50/streaming |
| Channels | 200+ bundled | À la carte |
| Sports | Included | Separate cost |
| Content cost | Hidden | Transparent |

---

## Sports: the last moat

| Reality | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Live sports | Only "must-watch" linear content |
| Delay tolerance | Zero (unlike scripted) |
| Ad rates | Premium |
| Bundling power | Forces cable retention |

**Erosion:** ESPN DTC, Amazon NFL, Apple MLB changing this.

## FAST channels (free ad-supported)

| Service | Owner | Strategy |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pluto TV | [[Paramount Global]] | 80M+ MAU |
| Tubi | [[Fox Corporation]] | 80M+ MAU |
| The Roku Channel | [[Roku]] | Platform integrated |
| Peacock (free tier) | [[Comcast]] | Funnel to paid |

**Trend:** Linear-like experience, free, on streaming.

| **Caution** | Hybrid media (transitioning) |
