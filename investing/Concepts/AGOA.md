**AGOA** (Africa Growth and Opportunity Act) — US trade preference program granting duty-free access to ~6,500 products from eligible African countries. Increasingly weaponized as leverage against China's Africa expansion.

---

## Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Enacted | 2000 |
| Current expiration | September 2025 (extension pending) |
| Eligible countries | ~35 African nations |
| Products covered | ~6,500 (apparel, agriculture, manufactured goods) |
| US imports under AGOA | ~$10B/year |

---

## How it works

1. **Eligibility criteria**: Rule of law, market economy, labor standards, no terrorism support
2. **Duty-free access**: Qualifying goods enter US without tariffs
3. **Annual review**: US can revoke eligibility for non-compliance
4. **Renewal leverage**: Countries must lobby for extension

## As US leverage tool

**Pattern emerging (2025-2026):** US using AGOA renewal as leverage against China trade deals.

| Country | Situation | Date |
|---------|-----------|------|
| [[Kenya]] | China deal stalled under US pressure; seeking AGOA extension | Jan 2026 |

**Mechanism:**
- African country wants AGOA extension (valuable duty-free access)
- Same country negotiating with China (Belt & Road, trade deals)
- US signals: choose us or lose AGOA benefits
- Binary choice forced on third countries

---

## Strategic significance

1. **Low-cost leverage**: AGOA costs US little (duty revenue forgone) but valuable to recipients
2. **Renewals = leverage moments**: Each expiration creates pressure point
3. **China counter**: Belt & Road offers infrastructure, AGOA offers market access — different value propositions
4. **Fragmentation risk**: Africa may split into US-aligned vs China-aligned trade blocs

---

## Investment implications

- Watch AGOA renewal debates for US-China proxy battles
- African countries with both AGOA access AND China deals face pressure
- Textile/apparel exporters (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho) most exposed to AGOA loss
- China may offer alternative preferences to offset AGOA withdrawal
