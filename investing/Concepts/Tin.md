**Tin** — base metal, critical for electronics soldering (semiconductors, PCBs, data centers). Tightest fundamental story in the base metals complex as of early 2026. LME record $56,800/t (Jan 26, 2026).

## Supply constraints

| Source | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| [[Indonesia]] | President Subianto ordered closure of 1,000 illegal mines in Sumatra. Refined exports -33% in 2024 to 46K tons |
| [[Myanmar]] | Man Maw mine (Wa State) — licenses issued but no verifiable export volumes |
| [[DRC]] | Bisie mine ([[Alphamin Resources]]) suspended operations |
| [[China]] | Resources depleted, smelters lack concentrates |

Global mine production forecast ~360K tons in 2026 (ITA). Projected 13K-ton supply deficit by 2030.

## Demand drivers

- Semiconductor soldering — AI/datacenter buildout
- Electronics manufacturing
- Energy transition (solar panel connections)

Tin has become an AI proxy trade — SHFE trading volume exceeded 1M tonnes in a single session (2x annual global physical usage), prompting [[China]] authorities to warn against speculation.
