**Data center land competition** — The AI-driven data center buildout is outbidding housing developers, agricultural landowners, and other real estate uses for land, particularly in Northern Virginia, Texas, Georgia, and the Chicago suburbs. Land prices have jumped 10-17x in some areas, with data center developers paying hundreds of millions for parcels originally slated for housing. The dynamic is emerging as a contributor to America's housing shortage and triggering political backlash.

## The economics

Data center developers can pay dramatically more than housing developers for the same land:

| Deal | Price | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| [[Amazon]] buys Stanley Martin land (Prince William County) | **$700M** | Home builder had acquired for ~$50M several years earlier |
| [[NTT]] buys vacant acreage (Prince William County) | **$257M** | One of the biggest vacant land deals ever |
| [[Toll Brothers]] sells Loudoun County site | **$185M** | Major contributor to record Q2 2024 earnings |
| Garden nursery land (Prince William County, Dec 2025) | **$160M** | Nursery closed, "difficult decision" |
| Village Place housing rights (250 units) sold to DC developer | **$31M** | Housing entitlements abandoned |
| [[CyrusOne]] buys site planned for 800 homes | **$2M/acre** | Westbrook Partners sold |
| Stream Data Centers knocks down 55 homes (Elk Grove Village, IL) | **~$1M/house** | Built 2.1M sq ft of data centers |

### Land price escalation

| Location | Before | Now | Multiple |
|----------|--------|-----|----------|
| US Route 67 near Dallas, TX | $20-40K/acre | **$350K+/acre** | ~10-17x |
| Prince William County, VA | Tens of thousands/acre | **Up to $3M/acre** | ~30-100x |
| Prince William County (developer offers) | — | **$1M/acre** (letter offers) | — |

## Why data centers win the land auction

1. **Higher returns per acre** — a single data center generates more revenue than a subdivision
2. **Property tax bonanza** — HHHunt lawyer argued DCs could bring in 6% of Hanover County's annual budget
3. **Zoning advantage** — local zoning can make it easier and faster to build data centers than housing
4. **Fewer residents to oppose** — data centers don't generate school enrollment or traffic complaints
5. **Labor competition** — data center construction absorbs electricians, concrete pourers. One Georgia builder: "They're going to put more wire in one building than in all the houses I've ever built in my lifetime"

## Scale of displacement

### Northern Virginia — "Data Center Alley"

- [[Loudoun County]] is the world's data center capital (fiber-optic backbone from dot-com era)
- Tech giants ([[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon]]) followed I-95 south to Prince William County
- **2013-2021**: data centers = 20-30% of all land development in Loudoun and Prince William Counties
- **2022-2024**: 50% more data center development than the previous 9 years combined
- Prince William County: up to **86 million sq ft** planned/zoned — equivalent of all office space in lower Manhattan
- Virginia housing shortage: **75,000 homes** (Virginia Association of Realtors)
- Conservation protections limit buildable land, concentrating all development into a smaller area
- December 2024 Virginia state legislature oversight report confirmed DCs picking off land that would have gone to housing

### Other hotbeds
- **Elk Grove Village, IL** (Chicago hub) — Stream Data Centers demolished an entire subdivision
- **Atlanta exurbs** — data center companies, warehousing firms, and home builders competing for highway-adjacent land
- **Dallas-Fort Worth corridor** — 10-17x land price appreciation along US Route 67
- **Hanover County, VA** (near Richmond) — HHHunt pivoted 900-home site to data center campus

## Political backlash

The politics are flipping. Local officials who welcomed data center tax revenue are now facing voter anger:

| Jurisdiction | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **Loudoun County** | Tightened policies — all proposed server farms now need county board approval |
| **Virginia legislature** | Bill proposed to limit DC construction to land already zoned/used for industrial |
| **Prince William County** | Supervisor Jeanine Lawson elected 2014 anti-housing, greenlighted DCs for tax revenue, lost 2023 election. "I misread my constituents. They'd rather have homes than data" |
| **Prince William County** | New chair Deshundra Jefferson opposes the "Digital Gateway" (2,000+ acres → 37 DCs), approved 1,000+ homes on Stanley Martin land instead |
| **Hanover County, VA** | Planning commission voted down HHHunt DC campus near-unanimously. Residents protested with "Grow Tomatoes, Not Data Centers" signs |

Data center developers made hefty political contributions — DC-connected donors were among the largest contributors to Prince William County board members in 2025.

## Capital crowding (macro)

[[Bridgewater]] report: data center financing demands could **increase the cost of capital** for other industries, including residential construction. The AI investment frenzy may hinder home-building not just through land competition but through capital markets.

---

## Counterargument

Stanley Martin CEO Steve Alloy rejected the framing: "There's very little overlap between where housing will go and where data centers will go." Home-building nationally constrained primarily by interest rates and financial factors, not land availability.

---

## Significance

This is a second-order effect of the AI infrastructure buildout. The first-order story (hyperscaler capex, chip demand, power consumption) is well understood. The land competition dynamic — where AI infrastructure directly crowds out housing in a country with a severe housing shortage — is newer and politically explosive.

The irony: NIMBYs who blocked housing are now getting data centers instead, which they find even worse (noise, power bills, no community benefit beyond taxes).
