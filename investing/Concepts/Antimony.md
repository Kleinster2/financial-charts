**Antimony** — Critical defense mineral. Essential for ammunition primers with NO substitute. China controls 48% of production. Price up 400% since Jan 2024. US restarting domestic production after 24-year gap.

## Why antimony is irreplaceable

Unlike other critical minerals, antimony has **zero substitutes** for its primary defense application:

> "Antimony trisulfide is an essential and non-replaceable component of American ammunition. There is no synthetic substitute, no alternative compound, and no workaround that maintains military specifications—the physics and chemistry of percussion ignition require antimony."
> — Colonel Steven Power, Picatinny Arsenal

**The physics**: Antimony trisulfide's friction sensitivity and burn characteristics are unique. No other compound ignites primers reliably across temperature ranges required for military use.

## Applications

| Sector | Use | Criticality |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Ammunition** | Primer compounds | Irreplaceable |
| **Flame retardants** | Electronics, textiles | High |
| **Lead-acid batteries** | Grid storage, vehicles | High |
| **Night vision** | Infrared sensors | Defense-critical |
| **Semiconductors** | Compound semiconductors | Moderate |

### Defense applications

| System | Antimony use |
|--------|--------------|
| Small arms ammunition | Primer ignition |
| Artillery shells | Primer compounds |
| Night vision goggles | IR sensors |
| Armor-piercing rounds | Hardening agent |
| Precision optics | Specialty glass |

## China dominance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China production share | **48%** |
| China share of US imports | **63%** |
| US annual consumption | ~50 million lbs |
| US domestic production (pre-2025) | **Zero for 24 years** |

---

## Export control timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Aug 14, 2024 | China announces export restrictions |
| Sep 15, 2024 | Dual-use export licenses required |
| Dec 3, 2024 | Full ban on US exports |
| Nov 2025 | Ban suspended until Nov 2026 |

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]], [[Gallium]], [[Germanium]] for the full Dec 2024 package.

## Price explosion

| Date | Price ($/metric ton) | Change |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Jan 2024 | $11,300 | — |
| Apr 2025 | $57,778 | **+411%** |
| Offers | ~$60,000 | — |

**Sharpest rally since 1980s** according to Fastmarkets. Steeper than any rare earth price spike.

## US response

The Pentagon is scrambling to rebuild domestic supply:

| Initiative | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **US Antimony Corp (Montana)** | $245M DLA contract, smelter operational |
| **Perpetua Resources (Idaho)** | $59.4M DPA funding + $1.8B EXIM loan |
| **Locksley Resources (California)** | First US antimony ingot in 24 years (Oct 2025) |

**Stibnite Project (Idaho)**: Could supply ~35% of US antimony demand. Critical strategic asset.

## Antimony vs other critical minerals

| Mineral | China control | Substitute | Price spike | Defense use |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Antimony** | 48% | **None** | 400% | Ammunition |
| [[Gallium]] | 99% | Limited | Moderate | Radar, 5G |
| [[Germanium]] | 60% | Some | Moderate | Fiber, IR |
| [[Dysprosium]] | 99% | None | 6x spread | Magnets |

**Antimony is unique**: Lower China control than Ga/Ge, but absolutely zero substitutes for ammunition. Physics constraint, not supply chain problem.

---

## Investment implications

**Direct plays:**
- United States Antimony Corp (UAMY) — Only US smelter
- Perpetua Resources — Stibnite project
- Locksley Resources — Mojave production

**Indirect beneficiaries:**
- Defense contractors with secured supply
- Battery manufacturers with alternatives

**Risk factors:**
- China ban suspension could pressure prices
- Permitting delays for new US mines
- Competition from other non-China sources

---

## The trust break

Even with Nov 2025 suspension:

> "The trust between U.S. buyers and Chinese suppliers has been fundamentally broken, leading to a permanent shift in procurement strategies that favors Western-aligned sources."

Pentagon will not return to China dependence regardless of price.
