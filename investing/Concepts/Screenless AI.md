**Screenless AI** — AI hardware that ditches the screen. Two camps: wearables (glasses, rings, pendants) and pocket devices (OpenAI/Jony Ive). The bet: context from being with you all day beats phone convenience.

> **Part of the broader [[Ambient AI]] paradigm.** This note covers hardware form factors. For environment-level intelligence (smart homes, healthcare, enterprise), see [[Ambient AI]].

## The thesis

AI is escaping the phone screen:

| Category | Form factors | Leaders |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Wearables** | Glasses, rings, pendants, clips | [[Meta]], [[Amazon]], Samsung |
| **Pocket/Handheld** | Pens, pocket companions | [[OpenAI]] + Jony Ive |

**Key insight:** Screenless devices enable AI to see/hear what you see/hear — unlocks context that phones can't provide.

**The graveyard:** Humane AI Pin ($699), Rabbit R1 ($199) — both tried to replace phones, both failed. Survivors focus on augmenting phones, not replacing them.

# Wearables

## Smart glasses

### Meta's strategy

**Ray-Ban Meta (2023+):**
- Partnership with EssilorLuxottica
- Camera + audio + Meta AI
- Best-selling smart glasses ever
- Consumer-friendly form factor

**Orion (prototype):**
- Full AR glasses with holographic display
- Developer/demo stage
- Years from consumer release

**Strategy:** Start with audio/camera glasses → graduate to full AR.

### Google Glass lesson

Google Glass (2012-2015) failed because:
- Too nerdy/conspicuous
- "Glasshole" social stigma
- Camera creepiness
- Too expensive ($1,500)
- No killer app

**What's different now:**
- Ray-Ban Meta looks like normal glasses
- AI provides actual utility
- Camera is expected (phones everywhere)
- Lower prices possible

### China's 70+ entrants

CNBC reports 70+ Chinese companies developing AI wearables:

| Device | Company | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| DingTalk A1 | Alibaba/DingTalk | Voice notes, transcription, 26ft range |
| Native Language Star | Le Le Gaoshang | Chinese-English translation for education |
| Various smart glasses | Multiple | Meta clones + differentiated |

**China's edge:**
- Manufacturing expertise
- Lower costs
- Faster iteration
- Huge domestic market

**Risk for Meta:** Chinese devices good enough at half the price.

## Ambient AI wearables

**The "no display" category** — wearables that listen and transcribe without screens or cameras.

| Device | Company | Price | Key features |
|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Bee | [[Amazon]] | $50 | Wrist/clip, week battery, to-do lists, email drafts |
| Friend | Friend (Avi Schiffmann) | $129 | Necklace, Gemini AI, emotional companion |
| Plaud | Plaud | ~$170 | Meeting recorder, transcription |
| AI Pin | [[Humane]] | $699 | **Failed** — buggy, poor battery, no killer app |
| R1 | Rabbit | $199 | **Failed** — overpromised, underdelivered |

### Amazon Bee

- Acquired September 2024 (8-person team)
- Part of Alexa+ strategy
- Truly ambient (no prompting needed)
- Week-long battery
- Does one thing well (daily journal)

### Friend

- $1M NYC ad campaign (11,000 subway ads) drew backlash
- Graffiti: "AI is not your friend"
- Reviews mixed-to-negative (snarky responses, forgot user's name)
- ~$7M VC funding
- Riskier thesis: companionship vs productivity

### Why Humane/Rabbit failed

- Tried to replace phone (too ambitious)
- Required user interaction (not ambient)
- Poor battery life
- Buggy software at launch
- No clear use case vs phone

## Smart rings

May beat glasses for some use cases:

| Advantage | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Social acceptance | No camera pointing at people |
| Always-on | Sleep, shower, exercise |
| Health sensors | Pulse ox, temperature, HRV |
| Gesture control | Natural interaction |
| Translation | Discreet use |

### Key players

| Ring | Company | Price | Subscription | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Oura Ring 4** | [[Oura]] | $349 | $5.99/mo | Market leader, best app, AI meal tracking |
| **Galaxy Ring** | Samsung | ~$400 | None | AI Energy Score, needs Samsung phone for full features |
| **Ultrahuman Ring Air** | Ultrahuman | ~$350 | None | **Banned in US** (Oct 2025) — Oura patent ruling |
| **RingConn Gen 2 Air** | RingConn | ~$200 | None | Budget, 10.5-day battery |
| **Helio Ring** | Amazfit | ~$300 | None | Limited sizing (only 3 options) |

### Market dynamics

- **Oura dominates** but subscription model ($72/year) opens door for competitors
- **Samsung** main challenger — AI insights but locked to Samsung ecosystem
- **Ultrahuman US ban** (ITC ruling Oct 2025) shows Oura defending IP aggressively
- **Chinese budget options** (RingConn, Amazfit) undercutting on price, no subscriptions
- **No Galaxy Ring 2 in 2025** — Samsung skipped refresh, eyes on 2026

# Non-wearables

## OpenAI + Jony Ive device

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Acquisition | OpenAI bought Ive's **io** for **$6.4B** (May 2025) |
| Form factor | Pocket-sized, screen-free, NOT wearable |
| Codename | "Gumdrop" — possibly a pen |
| Focus | Audio-first, voice interaction, contextual awareness |
| Timeline | 2026-2027 |

- Court filings: explicitly "not an in-ear device, nor a wearable"
- New advanced audio model expected Q1 2026 (natural speech, handles interruptions)
- Challenges: personality tuning, data privacy, computing infrastructure

**Why avoid wearable form factor:**
- Learning from Humane/Rabbit failures
- Less always-on-body privacy friction
- Pocket device = lower social awkwardness
- Competes with smartphones, not accessories

# Investment angles

**Direct plays:**
| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Meta]] | Ray-Ban glasses, Orion AR |
| [[Amazon]] | Bee ambient AI, Alexa+ integration |
| [[OpenAI]] | Jony Ive device ($6.4B io acquisition) |
| [[Apple]] | Vision Pro, Watch, future glasses |
| [[Google]] | Glass history, Android XR |
| [[EssilorLuxottica]] | Meta partner, smart glasses manufacturing |
| Qualcomm | AR/VR chips |

**Picks & shovels:**
| Component | Companies |
|-----------|-----------|
| Micro-displays | Sony, BOE |
| Sensors | ST, Bosch, TDK |
| Audio | Knowles, Cirrus |
| Batteries | Various |
| AI chips | Qualcomm, MediaTek |

## Bull case

- Always-on AI assistant = killer app
- Camera context enables new use cases
- China competition drives innovation/lower prices
- Health monitoring creates stickiness
- Enterprise applications (translation, field service)
- Form factor innovation (rings, patches)
- OpenAI/Jony Ive legitimizes category

---

## Bear case

- Social acceptance still uncertain
- Privacy concerns (always-on cameras/mics)
- Battery life constraints
- Display technology not ready for all-day
- Phone may remain primary device
- Google Glass / Humane / Rabbit failures fresh in memory

---

## What to watch

1. Ray-Ban Meta sales trajectory
2. Orion timeline to consumer
3. Apple glasses launch
4. Chinese entrant breakout (the "DeepSeek of wearables")
5. Enterprise adoption
6. Ring form factor traction
7. Amazon Bee rebranding and Alexa+ integration
8. OpenAI/Jony Ive device launch (2026-2027)
