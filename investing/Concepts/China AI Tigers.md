## Four Dragons (tech giants)

The incumbent AI players — not "Tigers" but the established powers:

| Company | AI model | Strategy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [[Alibaba]] | [[Qwen]] | Cloud distribution, open weights |
| [[Tencent]] | [[Hunyuan]] | WeChat integration |
| [[Baidu]] | [[Ernie]] | Search, autonomous driving |
| [[ByteDance]] | [[Doubao]] | [[TikTok]] ecosystem |

**Key difference:** Dragons have distribution (billions of users). Tigers have focus (pure AI).

## Six Little Dragons (Hangzhou startups)

Separate grouping — Hangzhou-based startups across sectors:

| Company | Sector |
|---------|--------|
| [[DeepSeek]] | AI models (efficiency focus) |
| [[Unitree]] | [[Robotics]] (quadruped) |
| Game Science | [[Gaming]] (Black Myth: Wukong) |
| Others | Various |

See [[Hangzhou]] for details.

## Investment implications

**All private** — not directly investable.

**Indirect exposure:**
- [[Alibaba]] — investor in [[Moonshot AI]], competes via [[Qwen]]
- [[Tencent]] — investor in MiniMax
- [[Microsoft]] — Azure offers some [[China]] models

**Thesis implications:**
- [[China]] AI ecosystem deeper than just [[Baidu]] and [[ByteDance]]
- Competition drives rapid iteration
- Valuations suggest AI premium persists
- Watch for HK/[[China]] IPOs

## Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Funding | Burn rates high, VC pullback possible |
| Consolidation | Giants may acquire or outcompete |
| Regulation | AI content rules tightening |
| [[Export controls]] | GPU access constrains training |
