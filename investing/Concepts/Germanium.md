**Germanium** — Critical material for fiber optics, infrared, and solar. China controls 60% of refined production. Banned for US export Dec 2024, suspended Nov 2025.

## Not a rare earth

Often grouped with rare earths but fundamentally different:

| Aspect | Germanium | Rare earths |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Use | Optics, infrared | Magnets |
| Form | Crystals, compounds | Permanent magnets |
| Applications | Fiber, IR, solar | EVs, wind, defense |
| China control | ~60% refined | 60-99% by element |

Germanium is about **optics and infrared**. Rare earths are about **magnets**.

## Why germanium matters

### Key applications

| Sector | Use | Why germanium |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| **Fiber optics** | Signal amplification | Dopes silica fiber for telecom |
| **Infrared optics** | Thermal imaging, night vision | Transparent to IR wavelengths |
| **Solar cells** | Multi-junction cells | Space/concentrated solar |
| **Semiconductors** | SiGe chips | High-frequency performance |
| **Defense** | Targeting systems, surveillance | IR sensors essential |

### Defense criticality

| System | Germanium use |
|--------|---------------|
| Night vision goggles | IR-transparent lenses |
| Thermal cameras | IR detector windows |
| Missile seekers | IR guidance optics |
| Satellite sensors | Space-grade IR |

## China's dominance

| Stage | China share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | Byproduct of zinc |
| Refining | **~60%** |
| US import reliance | **50%+** |

**Less concentrated than gallium**: Germanium has more non-China production (Belgium, Canada, Russia). But China still dominates, and alternatives are limited.

---

## Export control timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jul 2023 | Export licenses required |
| Dec 3, 2024 | Full ban on US exports |
| Nov 2025 | Ban suspended until Nov 2026 |

**Trigger**: Dec 2024 ban came one day after US added 140 Chinese entities to Entity List.

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]], [[Export controls]].

## Economic impact

US Geological Survey estimates:
- **$3.4B** combined hit from Ga + Ge ban
- Fiber optics infrastructure affected
- Defense night vision/IR systems exposed

---

## Supply chain alternatives

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Belgium (Umicore) | Significant refiner |
| Canada | Teck Resources produces |
| Russia | Producer (sanctions complicate) |
| US | Small recycling capacity |

**Better positioned than gallium**: More geographic diversity in germanium production. But scaling takes time.

---

## Who's exposed

**Telecom/fiber:**
- Fiber optic cable manufacturers
- Telecom infrastructure builders

**Defense:**
- Night vision manufacturers
- Thermal imaging systems
- Missile guidance (IR seekers)

**Solar:**
- Space-grade solar cell makers
- Concentrated photovoltaic

## Germanium vs Gallium

| Aspect | Germanium | [[Gallium]] |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| China control | ~60% | 99% |
| Primary use | Fiber optics, IR | Semiconductors, 5G |
| Alternatives | More available | Very limited |
| Defense impact | Night vision, targeting | Radar, EW |
| Substitutes | Some silicon options | Fewer options |

Both banned together, but germanium has more supply alternatives.

## Investment implications

**At risk:**
- Fiber optic infrastructure
- Defense IR/night vision suppliers
- Space solar manufacturers

**Potential beneficiaries:**
- Non-China germanium refiners (Umicore)
- Recycling from old electronics
- Alternative IR materials research
