# Trump defense budget

**January 7, 2026** — Trump calls for $1.5 trillion defense budget for FY2027, a 66% increase. "Dream military" for "troubled and dangerous times."

---

## The proposal

| Metric | FY2026 | FY2027 Proposed | Change |
|--------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| [[Defense]] budget | $901B | $1.5T | +66% |

**Funding source:** Tariff revenue from 2025-2026 trade actions.

---

## Context

Announced alongside aggressive foreign policy moves:
- [[Venezuela]] military operation (capture Maduro)
- [[Greenland]] acquisition push
- Colombia military operation floated

Trump: "After long and difficult negotiations... I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars."

---

## Executive order (Jan 8, 2026)

"Prioritizing the Warfighter in [[Defense]] Contracting" — signed Jan 8, 2026.

### Key provisions

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Dividend ban** | No dividends until production investment |
| **Buyback ban** | No share repurchases |
| **Exec pay cap** | $5M max until new plants built |
| **Compliance review** | Secretary of War identifies violators in 30 days |

### RTX specifically targeted

Trump singled out [[RTX]] ([[Raytheon]]):
- "Least responsive to needs of the DoD"
- "Slowest in increasing volume"
- "Most aggressive spending on shareholders rather than military needs"
- Threatened to cut off from DoD contracts

### Why this matters — the defense investment case

Bloomberg Intelligence (Will Lee, George Ferguson): [[Defense]] companies have "average profit margins and little chance of breakout earnings." Capital returns are how they attract investors.

> "Political shifts and lack of long-term visibility have limited capital investments, while shareholders expect favorable payout and buyback policies given slow growth."

**Buybacks + dividends since 2020:**

| Company | Buybacks | Dividends | Total |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | ~$25B | ~$12B | ~$37B |
| [[RTX]] | ~$18B | ~$17B | ~$35B |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | ~$10B | ~$8B | ~$18B |
| [[General Dynamics]] | ~$8B | ~$8B | ~$16B |
| [[Boeing]] | Minimal | Minimal | Crisis mode |

**The tension:** Trump wants production investment, but capital returns are the primary tool these companies use to attract investors given slow-growth, low-margin nature of defense.

### Enforceability questions

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| No equity stake | Government doesn't own shares |
| No board seats | No golden shares or reps |
| Legal challenges | Firms seeking advice |
| Constitutional | Regulatory taking? |

[[Morgan Stanley]]: "Carrots and sticks" — budget increase is carrot, capital restrictions are stick.

| [[RTX]] | Up | Missiles, defense systems |
| [[General Dynamics]] | Up | Submarines, vehicles |
| [[L3Harris]] | Up | Electronics, comms |

### Reversal (Jan 8) — executive order

| Stock | Move | Concern |
|-------|------|---------|
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | **-5.5%** | Dividend/buyback ban |
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | **-4.8%** | F-35 delays cited |

## What gets funded

If passed, likely beneficiaries:

| Category | Programs |
|----------|----------|
| **[[Golden Dome]]** | Missile defense (RTX, Lockheed) — $151B contract, $1T+ total |
| **Nuclear modernization** | GBSD (Northrop), Columbia-class subs (GD) |
| **Air dominance** | B-21 (Northrop), F-35 (Lockheed), NGAD |
| **Missiles** | Hypersonics, air defense (RTX, Lockheed) |
| **[[Space]]** | [[Space]] Force expansion (Northrop, Lockheed) |
| **Autonomous** | [[Drones]], AI systems (Anduril, primes) |
| **Shipbuilding** | Navy expansion (GD, HII) |

## Hurdles

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Congress approval | Required — not guaranteed |
| FY2026 not done | Still on continuing resolution |
| Deficit concerns | $1.5T is unprecedented peacetime |
| Implementation | Pentagon can't spend that fast |

---

## Historical context

| Year | [[Defense]] Budget | % GDP |
|------|----------------|-------|
| FY2024 | $886B | ~3.5% |
| FY2025 | $895B | ~3.5% |
| FY2026 | $901B | ~3.4% |
| **FY2027 proposed** | **$1.5T** | **~5.5%** |

Cold War peak was ~6% GDP. This would approach those levels.
