## The proposal

| Metric | FY2026 | FY2027 Proposed | Change |

| Defense budget | $901B | $1.5T | +66% |

**Funding source:** Tariff revenue from 2025-2026 trade actions.

## Context

Announced alongside aggressive foreign policy moves:
- Venezuela military operation (capture Maduro)
- Greenland acquisition push
- Colombia military operation floated

Trump: "After long and difficult negotiations... I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars."

| Category | Programs |
|----------|----------|

## Hurdles

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Congress approval | Required — not guaranteed |
| FY2026 not done | Still on continuing resolution |
| Deficit concerns | $1.5T is unprecedented peacetime |
| Implementation | Pentagon can't spend that fast |

---

## Historical context

| Year | Defense Budget | % GDP |
|------|----------------|-------|
| FY2024 | $886B | ~3.5% |
| FY2025 | $895B | ~3.5% |
| FY2026 | $901B | ~3.4% |
| **FY2027 proposed** | **$1.5T** | **~5.5%** |

Cold War peak was ~6% GDP. This would approach those levels.
