Pre-IPO tutoring (辅导) — a mandatory regulatory process in [[China]] where a securities firm (the "tutoring institution," 辅导机构) prepares a company for public listing. Required before filing IPO documents with the CSRC.

---

## How it works

1. Company engages a licensed securities firm as tutoring institution
2. Tutoring institution files with the local CSRC branch (provincial Securities Regulatory Bureau)
3. Tutoring period covers corporate governance, accounting standards, internal controls, disclosure practices, and IPO fundraising planning
4. Tutoring institution verifies the company meets listing requirements
5. Upon completion, the local bureau issues an acceptance letter
6. Company can then formally file IPO application with the exchange ([[STAR Market]], ChiNext, main board)

The tutoring institution almost always becomes the lead underwriter for the IPO, though this is not technically guaranteed.

## Typical timeline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Normal duration | 6-12 months |
| Fast-track examples | [[Unitree]]: 4 months (Jul-Nov 2025) |
| What fast completion signals | Government support for the sector/company |

Speed of tutoring completion is a proxy for regulatory enthusiasm. [[China]]'s securities regulators can accelerate or slow-walk the process depending on policy priorities.

## "Green passage" (绿色通道)

A separate fast-track mechanism for strategically important companies. Skips parts of the normal review queue. [[Unitree]] reportedly did not use the green passage — its 4-month tutoring was fast but through the standard process.

---

## Why it matters for investors

- Tutoring completion is the clearest pre-filing signal that an IPO is imminent
- The identity of the tutoring institution reveals the likely lead underwriter
- Duration signals government support level — shorter = more enthusiasm
- Companies in [[China]]'s priority sectors (AI, semiconductors, robotics, new energy) tend to move faster
