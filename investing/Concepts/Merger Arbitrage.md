**Merger Arbitrage** — The strategy of profiting from the spread between a target's current stock price and the announced deal price. The spread exists because completion is uncertain — regulatory, financing, shareholder, or competing bid risk.

---

## How it works

1. Deal announced: Acquirer offers $50/share for Target
2. Target trades at $48 (market prices in deal risk)
3. **Spread = $2 (4%)** — your profit if the deal closes
4. If deal breaks → stock drops back to pre-deal levels (often 20-40% loss)

**Risk/reward is asymmetric:** small upside if deal closes, large downside if it breaks.

## What drives the spread

| Factor | Wider spread | Narrower spread |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Regulatory risk** | Antitrust concerns, cross-border | Friendly regulators, small deal |
| **Financing** | Debt-funded, rate-sensitive | All-cash, well-capitalized buyer |
| **Shareholder approval** | Low irrevocables, hostile | Board-recommended, locked-up |
| **Competing bids** | Bidding war possible | No alternatives |
| **Time to close** | 12+ months out | Weeks away |
| **Political risk** | Sensitive industries, election year | Apolitical sectors |

---

## Spread types

| Scenario | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Tight spread (0-3%)** | Market confident deal closes |
| **Moderate spread (3-8%)** | Time value + some completion risk |
| **Wide spread (8-15%+)** | Significant regulatory/political risk |
| **Trading above offer** | Market expects a higher bid (competing offer) |
| **Negative spread** | Market thinks deal breaks or target worth more standalone |

---

## Key risks

- **Regulatory block** — DOJ/FTC/EU antitrust action (see [[Netflix]]/[[Warner Bros Discovery]] deal)
- **Financing failure** — buyer can't fund the deal
- **MAC clause** — Material Adverse Change lets buyer walk
- **Shareholder rejection** — insufficient votes
- **Deal fatigue** — long timelines erode confidence
- **Opportunity cost** — capital locked up earning small spread vs market returns

---

## Competing bid dynamics

When a rival bidder emerges, the arb math changes:

- Target often trades between the two offers
- **Upside = higher bid price minus current price**
- Risk shifts to: which bidder wins, or does target stay independent?
- Example: [[Warner Bros Discovery]] — Netflix at $27.75, [[Paramount Global]] at $30 → WBD trades ~$27.57, potential 9% upside if Paramount wins

## Historical context

- **Typical arb returns:** 3-8% annualized in normal environments
- **Best environments:** High M&A volume + reasonable spreads + friendly regulators
- **2026 outlook:** AllianceBernstein sees spread compression as more arb capital deploys into favorable M&A environment
- **Deal flow:** Mega-deals back — AI, media consolidation, pharma bolt-ons, infrastructure
