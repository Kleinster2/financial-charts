# China luxury boom and bust

The rise and fall of [[China]] as the global luxury industry's growth engine. Chinese consumers went from near-zero luxury penetration in the 1990s to driving ~35% of global luxury spending at peak — then pulled back sharply as property crisis, anti-corruption campaigns, and cultural shifts collided. China's mainland luxury market fell **18-20% in 2024** (Bain), reverting to 2020 levels.

## The boom (2000-2021)

### What happened
A newly wealthy Chinese middle and upper class discovered Western luxury brands simultaneously. Luxury became **social currency** — status signaling, gifting culture, and aspirational consumption all converged.

- [[LVMH]] went from near-zero China presence to deriving ~30% of revenue from Chinese consumers
- [[De Beers]] ran targeted campaigns importing the Western engagement ring tradition
- Chinese tourists became the #1 luxury spenders globally — Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Hawaii
- Gifting culture drove huge volumes — officials, business relationships, guanxi maintenance
- Diamond demand surged — the 2011 diamond price spike to ~8,500 was largely China's luxury boom (see [[Diamond market collapse]])

### Scale at peak
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Chinese share of global luxury | ~35% | Bain |
| China mainland luxury market | ~$60B (2021) | Bain |
| LVMH Asia ex-Japan revenue share | ~30%+ | LVMH filings |

## The bust (2022-present)

### Phase 1: Xi's anti-corruption campaign (2012-2013)
First shock to luxury demand. Xi Jinping's crackdown on official corruption and conspicuous consumption killed gifting culture overnight. Luxury stocks cratered. Brands that relied on government/SOE gifting (high-end watches, baijiu, jade) were hit hardest.

### Phase 2: Property crisis (2021+)
The [[Evergrande]] collapse and broader property crisis destroyed middle-class wealth. In China, ~70% of household wealth was in real estate. When property values fell 20-30%, the wealth effect reversed — consumers cut discretionary spending, including luxury.

### Phase 3: Cultural shift (2023+)
- **"Lying flat" (躺平)** and **"let it rot" (摆烂)**: youth disillusionment with the aspirational consumption treadmill
- **"Quiet luxury"** trend — understated over logos, less conspicuous consumption
- **Domestic brand preference**: growing nationalism favoring Chinese brands
- **Lab-grown diamonds**: practical Chinese consumer culture embraced lab-grown faster than Western markets — less attachment to the "natural is special" narrative

### The numbers (2024)
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| China mainland luxury market decline | -18 to -20% YoY | Bain |
| Market size reverted to | 2020 levels | Bain |
| Kering stock | -39.4% in 2024 | Fortune |
| Burberry stock | -30% in 2024 | Fortune |
| LVMH stock | -13% in 2024 | Fortune |
| Moncler stock | -7.8% in 2024 | Fortune |
| Gucci China sales | -24% Q1 2024 | Kering filings |
| Diamond inventory offloaded | $2B+ by Chinese retailers | Fortune, Feb 2025 |

### 2025 outlook
Bain projects China luxury market to remain **flat in 2025**. BoF (Nov 2025) says the market "won't soon return to pre-pandemic growth rates." The structural drivers (property wealth destruction, cultural shift, demographics) suggest this isn't cyclical — it's a regime change.

## Investment implications

**Losers:**
- [[LVMH]], [[Kering]], [[Burberry]], [[Richemont]] — overexposed to China growth that isn't coming back
- [[De Beers]] / natural diamonds — China was both the making and the breaking of modern diamond prices
- Luxury real estate in shopping destinations (Paris, Milan, Hong Kong)

**Potential winners:**
- Chinese domestic brands ([[Li Ning]], [[Anta Sports]])
- "Experiential luxury" over goods — travel, wellness, dining
- Japan luxury retail — Chinese tourists redirecting spend to Tokyo (weaker yen)
- India as the next luxury growth market (earlier stage, rising middle class)

**The template:** China's luxury bust is what happens when a commodity/sector's marginal buyer disappears. The luxury industry got addicted to Chinese growth and never diversified. Now they're scrambling.
