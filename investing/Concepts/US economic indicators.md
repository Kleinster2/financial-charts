## Interpretation (Feb 20, 2026)

Stagflationary signal: Q4 GDP 1.4% miss + PCE 3.0% = weak growth + sticky inflation. Complicates [[Federal Reserve]] rate path — cuts needed for growth, inflation argues against.

Labor market: Headline beats mask benchmark revisions showing 2025 was far weaker than originally reported.

CPI vs PCE divergence: CPI cooling toward target (2.4% headline), PCE stuck at 3.0% core. Gap largely tariff-driven goods inflation that shows in PCE but not CPI weights.

SCOTUS IEEPA ruling (Feb 20): Could ease tariff-driven inflation if IEEPA tariffs not fully replaced. See [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]].
