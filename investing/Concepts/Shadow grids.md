**Shadow grids** — Parallel power systems being built by hyperscalers and data center operators to bypass utility grid constraints. Includes on-site generation, dedicated substations, behind-the-meter batteries, and direct power purchase agreements. AI is turning electricity from a background cost into a first-order product constraint.

## Why it matters for investors

The AI buildout is hitting a hard physical limit: **megawatts**. Connection queues, transmission constraints, and permitting timelines are years behind the pace of data center construction. Rather than wait, Big Tech is building around the grid — creating a second, corporate-managed power infrastructure. This reshapes energy markets, data center siting decisions, and the competitive landscape between regions and utilities.

## Why it's happening

| Constraint | Problem | Timeline |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Grid connection queues | 3-7 year wait for new interconnections | Can't wait |
| Transmission capacity | Existing lines can't handle new load | Decades to build |
| Permitting | Environmental/zoning delays | Multi-year |
| Reliability | Grid outages kill AI training runs | Unacceptable |
| Cost volatility | Wholesale power price spikes | Unpredictable |

AI data centers need 50-500+ MW of continuous, reliable power. Utility grids in most regions simply aren't built for this.

## Shadow grid components

| Component | Function | Examples |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| On-site gas turbines | Baseload generation behind the meter | Many hyperscalers |
| Dedicated substations | Private grid connection, bypassing queue | [[Meta]], [[Microsoft]] |
| Behind-the-meter batteries | Buffer for grid instability | Standard practice |
| Direct PPAs | Long-term contracts with specific generators | [[Google]], [[Amazon]], [[Microsoft]] |
| Nuclear (SMR) | Zero-carbon baseload for AI DCs | [[Oracle]] ([[Larry Ellison]]), [[Microsoft]] (Three Mile Island restart) |
| On-site solar/wind | Supplemental generation | Less reliable for baseload |

## Connection to existing vault concepts

Shadow grids are the operational manifestation of several existing themes:

- **[[BYOP]]** (Bring Your Own Power) — hyperscalers securing dedicated power sources
- **[[Nuclear power for AI]]** — the ultimate shadow grid: zero-carbon, always-on, on-site
- **[[Oracle]]** — [[Larry Ellison]] pursuing nuclear DC permits, $50B capex
- **[[Power constraints]]** — the underlying bottleneck driving shadow grid construction

## Investment implications

**Winners:**
- Gas turbine manufacturers ([[GE Vernova]], Siemens Energy) — on-site generation demand
- Battery storage ([[Tesla]] Megapack, Fluence) — behind-the-meter buffer
- Nuclear/SMR ([[NuScale]], [[Oklo]], Kairos) — long-term baseload
- Utilities with excess capacity — premium for reliable power
- Regions with energy surplus — attract DC siting (Texas, Nordics, Middle East)

**Losers:**
- Utilities in constrained regions — hyperscalers bypass them entirely
- Regions without power surplus — lose DC investment to energy-rich competitors
- Ratepayers — if shadow grids draw talent/investment from public infrastructure

**Structural shift:** Power is becoming the new land — the scarce input that determines where AI capacity gets built. Companies that control their own power ([[Oracle]], [[Meta]]) have a structural advantage over those dependent on grid allocation.
