Foreign currency loans from international banks to Brazilian companies, denominated in USD/EUR. Popular structure for:

- **Trade finance** — importers borrowing to pay foreign suppliers
- **Working capital** — when USD rates < Selic (currently 15%)
- **Hedging** — companies with USD revenues matching USD debt

**Major providers:** [[Citi]], [[JPMorgan]], [[HSBC]], European banks

**Typical terms:**

- SOFR + spread pricing
- Requires Central Bank registration

## Why it matters

| Factor | Investment relevance |
|--------|---------------------|
| **FDI framework** | Legal basis for all foreign investment in [[Brazil]] |
| **Capital controls** | Registration requirement = government visibility into flows |
| **Interest rate arbitrage** | When Selic >> SOFR, 4131 loans are cheap funding |
| **Currency exposure** | USD debt creates FX risk for BRL-earning companies |

---

## Recent updates

**Law 14.286 (2021)** modernized Brazil's FX framework, updating some 4131 provisions:
- Simplified registration for small transactions
- Enabled more flexible hedging instruments
- Maintained core registration requirements

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **BRL depreciation** | USD debt burden increases for borrowers |
| **Capital flight** | In crises, profit remittances spike → BRL pressure |
| **Regulatory changes** | Government could restrict outflows in emergency |
