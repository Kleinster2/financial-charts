**Strategic mineral stockpiles** — Government-held or government-backed reserves of critical minerals to buffer supply disruptions. The US, [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] all maintain programs, but with fundamentally different models.

## Global stockpile landscape

| Program | Country | Size | Days of supply | Financing | Access |
|---------|---------|------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| [[Project Vault]] | [[United States]] | $12B | 60 days | EXIM debt + private equity | Membership (OEM draw rights) |
| National Defense Stockpile | [[United States]] | ~$900M | <50% of military needs | Federal budget | Military only |
| OBBA provisions | [[United States]] | $7.5B authorized | — | Federal budget | Defense |
| State Reserve Bureau | [[China]] | 35–133% of annual demand | Classified | State budget | State-controlled |
| [[JOGMEC]] | [[Japan]] | 34 rare metals | 60–180 days | Government subsidies | Commercial + strategic |
| KORES | [[South Korea]] | Expanding | 54 days → 100 days by 2031 | Government | Strategic |
| Critical Raw Materials Act | EU | Varies by member | Encouraged | National budgets | Framework only |

## Three models

### 1. Military reserve (traditional)

The US National Defense Stockpile, established 1939. Purely military — no civilian access regardless of market conditions.

| Era | Value | Coverage |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 1952 (peak) | $42B ($77B+ adjusted) | 5-year conflict with USSR |
| 2021 | $888M | <50% of 1-year conflict needs |
| 2023 | ~$1.3B | — |

98% decline in real value. The stockpile was systematically sold off post-Cold War. Now insufficient for a major conflict with [[China]].

**OBBA (2025–2026):** $7.5B in new funding — $2B for NDS, $5B for DoD supply chain investments, $500M Pentagon credit program. Separate from [[Project Vault]].

### 2. State-controlled (China)

Run by the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration (formerly State Reserve Bureau). Size is classified.

| Mineral | Estimated coverage |
|---------|-------------------|
| [[Copper]] | 35–133% of annual demand |
| [[Cobalt]] | 15,000+ tonnes purchased 2023–2024 |
| [[Rare earth elements]] | Undisclosed but substantial |
| Iron ore | Record 1.18B tonnes imported 2023 |

[[China]] uses its stockpile **offensively**:
- 2016: Bought copper at depressed prices to keep domestic smelters operational
- 2020: Stockpiled copper at elevated prices during COVID
- 2021: Released copper to shield manufacturers from high prices
- 2024–2025: Export controls on gallium, germanium, antimony as geopolitical leverage

This is a tool of industrial policy, not just emergency insurance.

### 3. Public-private hybrid (Project Vault / JOGMEC)

The newest model. Two implementations:

**[[Project Vault]] (US, 2026):**
- $10B EXIM loan + $2B private equity
- OEM members (Boeing, GM, Google, etc.) pay fees, lock purchase prices, draw in disruptions
- Must replenish what they draw — self-sustaining by design
- Not designed to profit — covers debt service via membership/operational fees

**[[JOGMEC]] (Japan, since 1983):**
- Government agency stockpiling 34 rare metals
- Also finances Japanese companies to secure overseas resources
- 60–180 day coverage targets depending on geopolitical risk
- Reduced Japan's China rare earth dependence from 90% to 58% in a decade

The hybrid model is the only one that gives private companies draw rights while maintaining government backing.

## Why stockpiles matter now

The convergence driving action:

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| [[China]] dominance | 70% rare earth mining, 90% processing, 40% copper smelting |
| Export controls | Gallium, germanium, antimony restricted 2024–2025 |
| AI demand | Data centers, chips, power infrastructure all mineral-intensive |
| Defense | Rearmament cycle across US, Europe, [[Japan]] — all need copper, rare earths |
| Supply timeline | 17 years from mineral discovery to mine production |

The US NDS was designed for Cold War-era threats. [[China]]'s mineral dominance creates a different kind of vulnerability — one that affects civilian industry, not just the military. [[Project Vault]]'s membership model is the policy response: extend strategic reserves to the commercial economy.

## SPR parallel

[[Project Vault]] is explicitly modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), but with key differences:

| Feature | SPR (oil) | Project Vault (minerals) |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Established | 1975 | 2026 |
| Capacity | 714M barrels | $12B in minerals |
| Financing | Federal appropriations | EXIM debt + private equity |
| Operator | Department of Energy | Independent CEO, private procurement |
| Access | Presidential release only (4 times ever) | Membership draw rights |
| Replenishment | Manual (often neglected) | Mandatory member replenishment |
| Market structure | Diversified oil producers | China-dominated minerals |

The SPR proved the concept works — it deterred oil embargoes for decades. But its weaknesses (political drawdowns without replenishment, dropping from 727M to ~372M barrels) informed Project Vault's self-replenishing design.
