**Monroe Doctrine** — 1823 US policy opposing foreign intervention in Western Hemisphere. Invoked by Trump administration to justify Venezuela action.

---

## Core principle

"The Americas for Americans" — US opposes European (now any foreign) colonization or interference in the Western Hemisphere.

**Original (1823):** Response to European powers potentially reclaiming former colonies.

**Modern interpretation:** US sphere of influence extends to all of Latin America; foreign powers (China, Russia) should not establish strategic footholds.

## Trump 2025-2026 revival

**Key statements:**
- Announced US will "run" Venezuela and take control of oil reserves
- Framed as protecting US interests in hemisphere
- Cited Chinese and Russian influence as threats

**Venezuela action (Jan 5, 2026):**
- US military captured Maduro
- Justified as countering Russian/Chinese presence
- Oil reserves (303B barrels) central to rationale

See [[Maduro capture 2026]] and [[Venezuela oil rebuild]] for details.
