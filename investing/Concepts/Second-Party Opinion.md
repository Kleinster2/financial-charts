**Second-Party Opinion** (SPO) — Independent assessment validating a [[Green bonds|green bond]] framework against standards like ICMA Green Bond Principles. Confirms use of proceeds, issuer credibility, and alignment with international ESG standards.

## What SPO verifies

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Use of proceeds** | Funds actually go to eligible green projects |
| **Project evaluation** | Selection criteria align with green taxonomy |
| **Management of proceeds** | Tracking and allocation processes |
| **Reporting** | Commitment to impact reporting |
| **Issuer ESG profile** | Overall sustainability credibility |

## Why SPO matters

**Credibility mechanism for green bonds:**

- **Anti-greenwashing**: Independent verification vs self-labeling
- **Investor mandates**: Many ESG funds require SPO-verified bonds
- **Pricing benefit**: SPO bonds often achieve tighter spreads ("greenium")
- **Reusable**: One framework/SPO covers multiple issuances

## SPO vs other verification

| Type | Timing | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Second-Party Opinion** | Pre-issuance | Framework alignment |
| **Verification** | Post-issuance | Use of proceeds tracking |
| **Certification** | Pre-issuance | Climate Bonds Standard certification |
| **Rating** | Ongoing | ESG risk assessment |

## Brazil context

[[Scala Data Centers]] used [[Sustainalytics]] SPO for its green debentures under the Scala Green Bond Framework:
- SCLL12 (Dec 2022) — BRL 2B
- SCLL13 (Nov 2023) — BRL 1.07B
- SCLL14/SCLL24 (Aug 2024) — BRL 1.5B

Single framework, multiple issuances — standard practice.
