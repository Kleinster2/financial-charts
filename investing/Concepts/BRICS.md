**If BRICS strengthens:**

**If BRICS fragments:**
- Status quo maintained
- Dollar dominance continues
- US-aligned trade routes preferred

## Venezuela connection

**Brazil's dilemma:**
- BRICS member (China/Russia aligned)
- Also in US sphere (Monroe Doctrine)
- Lula's response to Maduro capture matters
- Could face pressure from both sides

See [[Monroe Doctrine]] and [[Venezuela]].
