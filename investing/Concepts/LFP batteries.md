# LFP Batteries

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) — the dominant low-cost EV battery chemistry. Safer and cheaper than NMC/NCA, lower energy density. Industry shifted heavily toward LFP 2020-2025.

## Why LFP won

| Advantage | vs. NMC/NCA |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cost** | ~30% cheaper per kWh |
| **Safety** | No thermal runaway, passes nail penetration |
| **Cycle life** | 3,000-5,000 cycles vs 1,000-2,000 |
| **No cobalt/nickel** | Avoids supply chain risk, ethics issues |
| **Stability** | Less degradation over time |

| Disadvantage | vs. NMC/NCA |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Energy density** | ~160-180 Wh/kg vs 250-300 |
| **Range** | Shorter per kg |
| **Cold performance** | Worse (mitigated by heating) |

---

## Market size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global LFP market (2025) | $82.6B |
| Projected (2030) | $160.3B |
| CAGR | 14.2% |
| Share of EV batteries | ~60% in China, growing globally |

---

## Key players

| Company | LFP share | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **[[CATL]]** | ~48% global | Supplies Tesla, BMW, VW, Toyota |
| **[[BYD]]** | ~32% global | Blade Battery, 90% for EVs |
| **EVE Energy** | Growing | Chinese tier 2 |
| **CALB** | Growing | Chinese tier 2 |
| **Gotion High-Tech** | Growing | VW partnership |
| **LG Energy Solution** | Entering | $4.3B Tesla deal for US-made LFP (2027-2030) |

**China dominance:** CATL + BYD = 80% of global LFP market.

## BYD Blade Battery

[[BYD]]'s LFP innovation — cell-to-pack architecture:

| Feature | Blade Battery |
|---------|---------------|
| Form factor | Long thin cells arranged like blades |
| Innovation | Eliminates module layer |
| Safety | Passed nail penetration test (no fire) |
| Space efficiency | 50% more cells per pack |
| Applications | All BYD EVs, [[BYD#Linghui\|Linghui]] fleet vehicles |

**Impact:** Proved LFP could compete with NMC on range through packaging innovation.

## Industry shift to LFP

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | Tesla announces LFP for China Model 3 |
| 2021 | BYD Blade Battery launches |
| 2022 | Tesla expands LFP to US standard range |
| 2023 | Ford, VW announce LFP plans |
| 2024 | LFP overtakes NMC in China installations |
| 2025 | Tesla: 2/3 of vehicles will use LFP |
| 2027 | LG starts US LFP production for Tesla |

**Musk:** "Two-thirds of Tesla vehicles will use LFP batteries."

---

## Tesla's LFP strategy

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US LFP EVs | 85% are Tesla |
| EU LFP EVs | ~50% are Tesla |
| Current supplier | CATL (China) |
| Future supplier | LG Energy Solution (US, 2027-2030) |
| Deal value | $4.3B |

**Tariff driver:** US tariffs on Chinese batteries pushing domestic LFP production.

## LFP vs. Sodium-ion

| Factor | LFP | [[Sodium-ion batteries\|Sodium-ion]] |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Maturity | Dominant now | Emerging (2026) |
| Energy density | 160-180 Wh/kg | 140-175 Wh/kg |
| Cost | Low | Lower (potentially) |
| Materials | Lithium (constrained) | Sodium (abundant) |
| Cold performance | Moderate | Better |

**Relationship:** Sodium-ion may eventually take low-end from LFP, but LFP dominates for now.

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Dominant chemistry for mass-market EVs
- Grid storage growth (cost matters most)
- China supply chain mature
- LG/others building non-China capacity

**Bear case:**
- Sodium-ion competition coming
- Energy density ceiling limits premium EV use
- China concentration risk
- Lithium price volatility (though less than NMC)
