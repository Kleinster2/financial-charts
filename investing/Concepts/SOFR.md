# SOFR

The **Secured Overnight Financing Rate** — the primary USD benchmark interest rate that replaced [[LIBOR]] in 2023.

## What It Is

SOFR measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by US Treasury securities. Published daily by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] at approximately 8:00 AM ET.

**Current rate:** 3.65% (January 29, 2026)

## Why It Matters

- **Benchmark for trillions** — underpins adjustable-rate mortgages, corporate loans, derivatives, and floating-rate debt
- **Risk-free rate proxy** — based on actual repo transactions (~$3 trillion daily), not bank submissions like LIBOR
- **Fed policy transmission** — moves closely with the [[federal funds rate]]

## Key Variants

| Rate | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SOFR (overnight) | Single-day rate, published next business day |
| 30-day SOFR average | Compounded average over rolling 30 days |
| 90-day SOFR average | Compounded average over rolling 90 days |
| Term SOFR | Forward-looking rates (1M, 3M, 6M, 12M) published by [[CME Group]] |

Term SOFR is preferred for loans because borrowers know their rate at period start, not end.

## LIBOR Transition

SOFR officially replaced USD LIBOR on June 30, 2023. Key differences:

- **Secured vs unsecured** — SOFR is collateralized; LIBOR included bank credit risk
- **Backward vs forward-looking** — SOFR is based on actual transactions; LIBOR was surveyed expectations
- **No term structure** — overnight only (Term SOFR fills this gap)

The transition required repricing trillions in legacy contracts via fallback provisions.
