## The acronym evolution

| Acronym | Era | Components | Coined by |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------|
| **FANG** | 2013 | Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google | Jim Cramer |
| **FAANG** | 2017 | + Apple | Media consensus |
| **MAMAA** | 2021 | Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet | Post-FB rename |
| **Magnificent 7** | 2023 | Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, Tesla | BofA (Michael Hartnett) |
| **BATMMAAN** | 2024 | Broadcom, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA | Media (post-AVGO $1T) |

---

## What changed

| Transition | In | Out | Signal |
|------------|-----|-----|--------|
| FANG → FAANG | Apple | — | Apple's services growth |
| FAANG → Mag 7 | NVIDIA, Tesla, Microsoft | Netflix | AI boom, EV hype, Netflix matured |
| Mag 7 → BATMMAAN | Broadcom | — | AI networking, $1T market cap (Dec 2024) |
| Next? | ? | Tesla? | Rotation TBD |

**Key insight**: Netflix was removed. The only original FANG member to lose its spot. Streaming commoditized.

**Broadcom's rise**: AVGO hit $1T on AI networking tailwinds — custom ASICs for hyperscalers + VMware acquisition. The "8th Magnificent."

## Magnificent 7 (current)

| Company | Ticker | Why included |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [[Apple]] | AAPL | Ecosystem, services, cash |
| [[Microsoft]] | MSFT | Cloud + AI (OpenAI bet) |
| [[Google]] | GOOGL | Search, cloud, Gemini |
| [[Amazon]] | AMZN | AWS, retail, logistics |
| [[NVIDIA]] | NVDA | AI infrastructure monopoly |
| [[Meta]] | META | Social, ads, AI pivot |
| [[Tesla]] | TSLA | EV, energy, Musk premium |

**Combined market cap**: ~$15T+ (as of early 2026)

---

## 2025 reality check

The "Magnificent 7" label masked huge dispersion:

| Company | 2025 Performance | Reality |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| [[NVIDIA]] | Strong | AI infrastructure monopoly |
| [[Google]] | Strong | Search + Gemini narrative |
| [[Apple]] | Flat | No AI story, China weakness |
| [[Microsoft]] | Mixed | Copilot adoption slow |
| [[Amazon]] | Mixed | AWS growth questions |
| [[Meta]] | Mixed | AI spend ROI unclear |
| [[Tesla]] | Weak | Competition, margin pressure |

**The truth**: In 2025 it was really just "The Magnificent 2" — GOOG and NVDA.

**Lesson**: Acronyms create false equivalence. Basket trades ignore fundamentals.

---

## The pattern

Each acronym era reflects:

| Element | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Inclusion** | Current momentum leaders |
| **Exclusion** | Narrative losers |
| **Timing** | Often coined near peaks |
| **Media role** | Creates self-reinforcing flows |

**Contrarian signal**: When CNBC can't stop saying the acronym, momentum may be exhausted.

---

## Historical parallels

| Era | Acronym/Theme | Fate |
|-----|---------------|------|
| 1960s | Nifty Fifty | Crashed 1973-74 |
| 1990s | Four Horsemen (CSCO, DELL, INTC, MSFT) | Dot-com bust |
| 2000s | BRICs | Diverged dramatically |
| 2010s | FAANG | Evolved into Mag 7 |
| 2020s | Magnificent 7 | TBD |

**The lesson**: Acronyms mark momentum, not permanence. Composition always changes.

---

## Concentration risk

Mag 7 as % of S&P 500:

| Year | % of S&P 500 |
|------|--------------|
| 2020 | ~22% |
| 2023 | ~28% |
| 2024 | ~32% |
| 2025 | ~35%+ |

**Implication**: S&P 500 is a concentrated bet on 7 stocks. "Diversification" is an illusion.

---

## Investment implications

**Index investors**: You already own Mag 7 heavily. Adding individual positions = doubling down.

**Active managers**: Underweighting Mag 7 = career risk. Benchmark is the acronym.

**When it ends**: Acronym changes when:
- A member stumbles badly (Tesla?)
- New leader emerges (who?)
- Sector rotation to value/small-cap
- Regulatory breakups

---

## What comes next?

Candidates for future acronym inclusion:

| Company | Case for |
|---------|----------|
| [[Broadcom]] | AI networking, grew into mega-cap |
| [[TSMC]] | Monopoly on leading-edge |
| Berkshire | Old guard, but growing |

Candidates for removal:

| Company | Risk |
|---------|------|
| [[Tesla]] | Valuation, competition, Musk distraction |
| [[Meta]] | AI spend returns unclear |
