# Third Wave coffee

Movement treating coffee as an artisanal product (like wine) rather than a commodity. Emphasizes single-origin sourcing, direct trade with farmers, lighter roasts that highlight terroir, and barista craft. Emerged in the late 1990s-2000s, building on earlier "waves" (commodity coffee, then Starbucks-era espresso culture).
