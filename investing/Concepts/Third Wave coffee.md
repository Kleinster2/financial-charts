# Third Wave coffee

Movement treating coffee as an artisanal product — analogous to wine or craft beer — rather than a commodity. Emphasizes single-origin sourcing, direct trade with farmers, lighter roasts that highlight terroir, and barista craft. Term coined by Trish Rothgeb (2003) in the Roasters Guild newsletter.

## The Three Waves

| Wave | Era | Philosophy | Exemplars |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| First | 1800s-1960s | Coffee as commodity. Vacuum-sealed cans, percolators, instant coffee. Convenience over quality. | Folgers, Maxwell House, Nescafe ([[Nestle]]) |
| Second | 1960s-1990s | Coffee as experience. Espresso drinks, dark roasts, cafe culture. Origin acknowledged but blended away. | [[Starbucks]] (1971), Peet's Coffee ([[JDE Peet's]]), [[Keurig Dr Pepper|Green Mountain]] |
| Third | Late 1990s-present | Coffee as craft. Single-origin, light roast, direct trade, transparency from seed to cup. Roaster and farmer both matter. | [[Intelligentsia Coffee]], [[Stumptown Coffee]], Counter Culture (the "Big Three"); [[Irving Farm Coffee]], [[Blue Bottle Coffee]], [[La Colombe]], [[Devocion]] |

Some industry observers describe a nascent Fourth Wave — hyper-scientific extraction (refractometers, precision brewing), AI-assisted roasting profiles, and farmer-as-brand (producers selling direct to consumers, bypassing roasters entirely). Not yet a consensus term.

## Core Principles

- Single-origin over blends — traceability to a specific farm, cooperative, or micro-lot
- Direct trade — roasters buy from farmers without intermediaries, paying premiums of ~30% over commodity prices; ~50% of global coffee value comes from specialty-grade beans despite far less volume
- Light roasting — showcases the bean's terroir rather than masking it with char; Third Wave roasters reject the dark-roast orthodoxy of the Second Wave
- Barista as craftsperson — manual brew methods (pour-over, AeroPress, siphon) alongside espresso; latte art as skill signal
- Transparency — publishing farm-gate prices, origin stories, processing methods; some roasters (Onyx Coffee Labs) publish exact per-pound costs vs. Fair Trade minimums

## Investment Relevance

Third Wave created the premium segment that mega-consolidators then acquired. [[JAB Holding]]'s $50B coffee roll-up (2012-2025) and [[Nestle]]'s [[Blue Bottle Coffee]] acquisition were essentially bets that Third Wave taste preferences would scale. The pattern: independent roasters build brand and sourcing relationships, then get absorbed by CPG/PE capital seeking growth in a mature commodity category.

The few remaining independents ([[Irving Farm Coffee]], [[La Colombe]], [[Joe Coffee]], [[Devocion]]) face a strategic choice: stay small with direct trade authenticity, or take capital and scale at the risk of diluting what made them Third Wave in the first place. [[Illycaffè]] and [[Lavazza]] represent an Italian variant — family-owned, quality-focused, but operating at scale without Third Wave branding.
