## Platform take rates

| Platform | Take rate | Creator cut | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [[OnlyFans]] | 20% | 80% | Best for creators |
| [[Patreon]] | 5-12% | 88-95% | Tiered by plan |
| [[YouTube]] | ~45% | ~55% | Ad revenue share |
| [[Twitch]] | 50% | 50% | Subscriptions |
| TikTok | Varies | — | Creator Fund + brand deals |
| Substack | 10% | 90% | Paid newsletters |
| Spotify | ~30% | ~70% | Podcast subscriptions |

**OnlyFans paradox:** Highest creator cut but adult-focused limits mainstream adoption. [[Patreon]] offers best SFW terms.

## Power law dynamics

Creator earnings follow extreme power law distribution:

| Tier | % of creators | % of earnings |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Top 1% | 1% | 30-40% |
| Top 10% | 10% | 70-80% |
| Bottom 50% | 50% | <5% |

**Most creators earn almost nothing.** Platforms profit regardless — take rate on $0 is $0, but take rate on superstars compounds.

**[[OnlyFans]] example:** Top 1% (46K creators) earn 33% of total revenue. 1,200+ earn $1M+/year. Bottom 50% (2.3M) earn <$100/month.
