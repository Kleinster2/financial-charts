## Drivers

### 1. Tax-delay selling

Institutional investors held winning positions through Dec 31 to defer capital gains into 2026 tax year. Selling hit "fever pitch" on Jan 2.

### 2. AI ROI Audit

After 2024-25 AI hype, market demanding proof of return on AI investments. Companies without tangible AI revenue growth getting punished.

### 3. Valuation reset

Many 2025 winners (AI, growth) seen as overvalued entering 2026.

### 4. Policy catalysts

- Trump defense budget ($1.5T) → defense rally
- Rate cut expectations → financials benefit

|----------|----------|
| **Short-term (tax selling)** | 2-4 weeks |
