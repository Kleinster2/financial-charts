**Steepener trade** — Betting short-term yields fall faster than long-term. Hottest bond strategy of 2025. Works when Fed cuts + deficits/inflation pressure long end.

---

## The trade

**Position:**
- Long short-maturity Treasuries (2-year)
- Short long-maturity Treasuries (10-year, 30-year)
- Profits when gap widens

**2s10s spread:** Difference between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields.

| Date | 2s10s Spread | Context |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Jan 2026 | ~130bp | Largest in 9 months |
| Trend | Steepening | [[Trade]] working |

---

## Why it works in 2026

| Driver | Effect on curve |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Fed cuts** | Short-end rallies (yields fall) |
| **Deficit concerns** | Long-end sells off (yields rise) |
| **Inflation sticky** | Long-end pressure |
| **Fed independence fears** | Long-end selloff |
| **Treasury supply** | $61B 10/30-year auctions weighing |

**Result:** 2-year yields fall, 10/30-year yields rise → curve steepens.

## Who's in the trade

| Firm | Position |
|------|----------|
| **Pimco** | Major steepener position |
| **Capital Group** | Overweight short maturities |
| **Vanguard** | "Only trade we have liked entering the year" |
| **JPMorgan analysis** | 25 largest bond funds have large exposure |

**Pramod Atluri (Capital Group):**
> "Over the next 12 to 24 months there's a lot of scenarios where a steepener is going to work out well."

**Brian Quigley (Vanguard):**
> "We are pretty neutral on rates, and the only trade we have liked entering the year is a curve-steepener."

## Scenarios where it works

| Scenario | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Risk-off** | Flight to safety → Fed cut bets → short-end rallies |
| **Strong growth** | Long-end yields rise on inflation |
| **Deficit worries** | Long-end sells off |
| **Dovish Fed chair** | More cuts priced → short-end rallies |

**Atluri:** Works in "any sort of broad risk-off move in credit or equities."

---

## Risks / pushback

**Subadra Rajappa (SocGen):**
> "I don't see much room for the curve to continue to steepen. A stable labor market and sticky inflation argue for fewer cuts."

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Inflation stays high** | Fed pauses → short-end stalls |
| **Strong jobs data** | Fewer cuts priced |
| **Tariff ruling** | Could cut both ways |
| **Already crowded** | Funds reducing exposure |

---

## Fed path expectations

| Timing | Market pricing (Jan 2026) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Next cut | Mid-2026 |
| Second cut | Q4 2026 |
| Total 2026 cuts | 2 (possibly 3 if dovish chair) |

**Tony Rodriguez (Nuveen):**
> "The market will likely price in a third rate cut this year" if Trump appoints dovish Fed chair.

---

## Tariff wildcard

**Supreme Court ruling pending:**

| Outcome | Bond impact |
|---------|-------------|
| **Against tariffs** | Less inflation fear → long-end rallies (hurts steepener) |
| **For tariffs** | Revenue concerns → deficit angst → long-end sells (helps steepener) |

**John Brady (RJ O'Brien):** Lighter tariffs could support long maturities, dash steepener bets.
