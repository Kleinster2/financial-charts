**Active ETFs** --- Exchange-traded funds where a portfolio manager (or systematic/quantitative process) makes discretionary investment decisions rather than tracking a pre-defined index. Enabled at scale by the [[SEC]]'s 2019 Rule 6c-11, the category has exploded from a niche to ~$1.5T in AUM by end-2025, capturing 31% of all ETF flows despite holding only 11% of total ETF assets. The structural advantages of the ETF wrapper (tax efficiency, lower costs, intraday trading) are pulling assets out of traditional mutual funds at an accelerating pace.

## Definition and structure

An ETF is "active" if it does not track a published index. The manager has discretion over security selection, weighting, and timing. In practice, "active" is a broad label covering:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Fundamental active | Traditional stock/bond picking by PMs | [[Capital Group]] CGDV, [[Fidelity]] FCNTX ETF |
| Systematic/quantitative | Rules-based factor tilts, not index-tracking | [[Dimensional]] DFAC, [[Avantis]] AVUS |
| Derivative overlay | Options-writing on indices or single stocks | [[JPMorgan Chase]] JEPI/JEPQ |
| Thematic | Concentrated bets on innovation themes | [[ARK Invest]] ARKK |
| Buffer/defined outcome | Options structures with downside protection | Innovator, First Trust |

Many of the most popular "active" ETFs are systematic --- labeled active because they don't track an index, but running quantitative or rules-based strategies with limited discretion. This blurs the active/passive boundary.

### Transparency models

| Model | Disclosure | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Fully transparent | Daily full holdings | Standard under Rule 6c-11; majority of active ETFs |
| Semi-transparent (proxy portfolio) | Quarterly full, daily proxy basket | Preserves manager IP; Precidian, Blue Tractor, Fidelity models |
| Semi-transparent (non-transparent) | Quarterly full, no daily proxy | T. Rowe Price, Natixis models; wider spreads, less AP interest |

Semi-transparent models have gained limited traction. [[Capital Group]], the fastest-growing active ETF issuer, chose full daily transparency and credits it with tighter spreads and stronger AP engagement.

## Regulatory history

### Pre-2019: exemptive order era

Before 2019, each ETF required an individual exemptive order from the [[SEC]] under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This was expensive ($100K+ legal costs), slow (12-18 months), and created barriers for new entrants. The first active ETF (Bear Stearns Current Yield, 2008) launched under such an order.

### Rule 6c-11 (Sep 25, 2019)

The [[SEC]] adopted Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act, creating a standardized framework for ETFs. Key provisions:

- ETFs organized as open-end management investment companies can launch without individual exemptive orders
- Daily portfolio transparency required on the ETF's website
- Custom basket flexibility for authorized participants (APs)
- Standardized creation/redemption procedures

What Rule 6c-11 does NOT cover: leveraged/inverse ETFs, ETFs organized as UITs, share-class ETFs, master-feeder structures, and active ETFs that do not provide daily transparency. These still require exemptive orders.

The semi-transparent active ETF models (Precidian's ActiveShares, Blue Tractor, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Natixis) received separate SEC approvals in 2019-2020, allowing active managers to shield daily holdings.

### Vanguard patent expiry (May 2023)

[[Vanguard]] pioneered the dual share-class structure in 2001 --- allowing an ETF share class within an existing mutual fund --- and held the patent until May 2023. This structure let ETF shareholders benefit from tax efficiency while the mutual fund continued operating. Upon expiry, ~80 asset managers filed with the [[SEC]] for exemptive relief to offer their own ETF share classes.

### Dimensional approval (Nov 2025)

The [[SEC]] granted [[Dimensional]] formal approval to offer both ETF and mutual fund share classes within the same fund structure. The SEC directed all subsequent applicants to make their filings "substantially the same" as Dimensional's amended application. This is the single biggest structural development of 2025 --- it enables any mutual fund to add an ETF share class, letting taxable investors access ETF tax efficiency without forcing a full conversion.

Timeline for broader rollout: DTCC automated conversion infrastructure expected Q2 2026. Industry testing commenced Q1 2026. More than 80 managers have applications pending.

## Market size and growth

| Metric | Value | Date |
|--------|-------|------|
| Active ETF AUM (US) | ~$1.5T | End-2025 |
| Active ETF share of total ETF assets | 11% | End-2025 |
| Active ETF share of 2025 net new flows | 31% ($459B) | 2025 full year |
| Total US ETF market AUM | ~$13T | End-2025 |
| Total US ETF net inflows (2025) | $1.48T (record) | 2025 full year |
| Number of active ETFs | 2,226 | Mid-2025 (Morningstar) |
| Number of passive ETFs | 2,157 | Mid-2025 (Morningstar) |
| Active ETFs launched (2025) | ~962 (85% of all launches) | 2025 full year |
| Active ETFs closed/merged (2025) | ~150 (114 liquidations, 32 mergers) | 2025 full year |
| Active ETF AUM growth (2025) | +64% | 2025 full year |
| Active ETFs grew from (2020-2024) | 412 funds to 1,531 funds (+272%) | 2020-2024 |

The number of active ETFs exceeded passive ETFs for the first time in mid-2025 ([[Morningstar]]). By count, active is now the majority. By assets, passive still dominates at ~89%.

### Flow share is the leading indicator

Active ETFs captured 36% of total ETF inflows in 2025, vs only 11% of assets. Active equity ETF flows were 30% of all equity flows (up from 6% in 2021). Active fixed income captured 38% of bond ETF flows. The asset share will converge toward the flow share over time.

### Projections

Global active ETF AUM expected to reach $4.2T by 2030 (Deloitte/PwC estimates). US active ETF market projected to triple from current levels.

## Key players

### Largest active ETF issuers (end-2025 / early-2026)

| Issuer | Active ETF AUM | Flagship funds | Notes |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | ~$257B | JEPI ($37B+), JEPQ ($23B+), JPST | Overtook Dimensional as #1 in Jan 2026. ~160 active ETFs. |
| [[Dimensional]] | ~$255B | DFAC ($32B), DFAT ($7.8B) | Systematic/factor-based. First ETF share class approval (Nov 2025). Converted 7 mutual funds to ETFs. |
| [[Capital Group]] | ~$53B | CGDV, CGUS, CGXU | Launched 2022, fastest organic growth ever. 22 ETFs. Named 2025 ETF Issuer of the Year (ETF.com). 5.8% market share. |
| [[Avantis]] | ~$50B | AVUS, AVUV, AVDV | Subsidiary of [[American Century]]. 90%+ of assets in ETFs. Factor-tilted systematic. |
| [[PIMCO]] | ~$47B | MINT ($14.6B), PYLD ($10.1B), BOND ($6B) | 23 ETFs. Dominant in active fixed income. |
| [[BlackRock]]/iShares | Large (exact TBD) | Various active fixed income | Expanding active via iShares brand. Led active fixed income flows in Q1 2025. |
| [[Fidelity]] | Large (exact TBD) | FBTC ($12B, Bitcoin), FBCG, FBCV | Semi-transparent model pioneer. Also applied for ETF share class. |
| [[ARK Invest]] | ~$20B+ | ARKK, ARKW, ARKG, ARKQ | Best-performing issuer of 2025. ARKK +35.6% but shed $1.2B in outflows. |

Six firms --- [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Capital Group]], [[Dimensional]], [[BlackRock]], [[American Century]] (via [[Avantis]]), and [[Fidelity]] --- captured roughly half of all active ETF inflows in 2025.

### Mutual fund-to-ETF conversions

| Year | Conversions | Notable |
|------|------------|---------|
| 2022-2023 | ~25/year | Trend doubled from 2022 to 2023 |
| 2024 | 45+ ($10B+ assets) | Accelerating |
| 2025 | 60 (across 31 firms, record) | Dimensional, JPMorgan, others |

[[Dimensional]] was an early mover, converting 7 systematic/tax-managed mutual funds. DFAC (converted from DFA US Core Equity 2) attracted $3.5B in post-conversion inflows and reached $32B. [[JPMorgan Chase]] proposed converting ~$6B in mutual funds (Feb 2025), including mortgage-backed, data science, and international equity strategies. JIRE (converted) reached ~$7B.

## Performance: do active ETFs beat passive?

The data is unambiguous over long periods and mixed over short ones.

### SPIVA Scorecard results

| Period | % of active large-cap US equity funds underperforming S&P 500 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2024 full year | 65% |
| H1 2025 | 54% (improved) |
| 10-year average (through mid-2025) | 79% failed to survive and beat passive peers |
| 24-year SPIVA average | 64% underperform annually |

### Morningstar Active/Passive Barometer (through Jun 2025)

- 33% of active strategies survived and beat their average indexed peer (1-year)
- 21% survived and beat over the trailing decade
- 63% of active bond funds beat passive in 2024 (up from 48% prior year)
- Small-cap: only 30% underperformed in 2024 --- the best year for active small-cap in 20+ years of SPIVA data

### Where active has an edge

Active tends to outperform in less efficient markets:
- Small/mid-cap equities (fewer analysts, more mispricing)
- Fixed income (63% beat rate in 2024; OTC market, less indexable)
- International/EM (information asymmetry)
- High-yield/credit (security selection matters more)

Active consistently underperforms in:
- US large-cap equity (most efficient market on earth)
- Any category over 10+ year periods (survivorship bias, fee drag)

### Expense ratio comparison

| Category | Asset-weighted avg expense ratio (2024) |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Active ETFs | 0.49% |
| Passive ETFs | 0.12% |
| Active mutual funds | ~0.68% (active ETFs are 36% cheaper) |

The fee gap is the primary structural headwind for active. Expense ratios are negatively correlated with net returns across all categories and time periods.

## Structural advantages of the ETF wrapper

### 1. Tax efficiency (the killer feature)

The in-kind creation/redemption mechanism is the single most important advantage of ETFs over mutual funds.

How it works:
- When an AP redeems ETF shares, the ETF issuer delivers underlying securities (in-kind) rather than selling for cash
- The issuer sends out the lowest-cost-basis tax lots first, raising the average cost basis of remaining holdings
- This purges embedded capital gains without triggering taxable events
- Even during net selling, ETFs avoid the forced selling that mutual funds face

The data (Harvard Law, 2025):

| Metric | ETFs | Index mutual funds | Active mutual funds |
|--------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Realized capital gains (avg) | 4.11% | 4.18% | 5.97% |
| Capital gains *distributed* (avg) | 0.12% | 2.11% | 3.72% |

ETFs realize similar gains but distribute almost nothing. In 2022 (S&P -18.1%), 42% of active mutual funds distributed capital gains worth an average 5% of NAV to shareholders --- while most ETFs distributed zero.

### 2. Lower costs

Active ETFs have a 36% lower average expense ratio than active mutual funds (0.49% vs ~0.68%). No 12b-1 distribution fees. No multiple share classes with different fee loads.

### 3. Intraday trading and transparency

ETFs trade on exchanges throughout the day at market prices. Mutual funds price once daily at NAV close. ETFs offer limit orders, stop-losses, options overlays. Fully transparent active ETFs disclose daily holdings, enabling tighter spreads from market makers.

### 4. No minimum investment

Unlike institutional mutual fund share classes (often $1M+ minimums), ETFs are accessible at one share. This democratizes access to strategies previously available only to institutions.

## Recent trends (2024-2026)

### ETF share classes (the next structural shift)

[[Vanguard]]'s patent expired May 2023. [[Dimensional]] received SEC approval Nov 2025. 80+ managers have applications pending. This allows any mutual fund to add an ETF share class, giving taxable investors tax-efficient access without forcing a full fund conversion or losing the mutual fund's track record.

Estimated impact: $10T+ of existing mutual fund assets could potentially add ETF share classes. This is the single biggest structural change for the industry since Rule 6c-11 itself.

### Buffer/defined outcome ETFs

Equity buffer ETFs attracted $14.4B in inflows in 2025. The defined-outcome category reached $78B AUM across 420 funds, growing at 39% annualized over the past three years. These use options structures to cap upside in exchange for partial or full downside protection (100% buffer products typically cap gains at 8-10% annually).

### Options-based/derivative income ETFs

JEPI and JEPQ (covered call strategies) are the two largest active ETFs globally. Options-based ETFs gathered $54B in 2025. Single-stock covered call ETFs gained momentum as yield alternatives.

### Active fixed income ETFs

Bond ETFs attracted $430B in flows in 2025 (30% of all ETF flows). Active captured 38% of fixed income flows. [[PIMCO]], [[BlackRock]]/iShares, and [[Fidelity]] are the leaders. Active fixed income is expected to accelerate in 2026 given rate uncertainty and the inherent inefficiency of bond markets.

### Single-stock ETFs

Leveraged and inverse single-stock ETFs (2x TSLA, -1x NVDA, etc.) grew rapidly in 2025, particularly among retail traders. Regulatory concerns persist about leverage, daily reset mechanics, and suitability.

---

## Criticism and risks

### Closet indexing

Many popular "active" ETFs are essentially systematic/rules-based strategies labeled active only because they don't track an index. [[Morningstar]] notes that "most of what has taken off" follows quantitative approaches, raising the question of whether investors are paying active fees for quasi-passive exposure.

### Higher fees, persistent underperformance

The 37 bps fee premium over passive (0.49% vs 0.12%) compounds over decades. Over 10 years, 79% of active funds fail to survive and beat passive. The fastest-growing categories (buffer ETFs, defined outcome) are among the most expensive, often exceeding 0.75%.

### Capacity constraints

Active strategies face capacity limits that passive indices do not. A successful small-cap fund that grows too large starts moving markets against itself. ETFs that can't limit inflows (unlike mutual funds that can soft-close) face structural capacity problems. This has already forced some active ETFs to close to new investments.

### Transparency trade-offs

Fully transparent active ETFs reveal daily holdings, risking front-running by other market participants who can replicate the manager's trades. Semi-transparent models solve this but create other problems: wider bid-ask spreads, fewer willing APs, limited custom basket flexibility (reducing tax efficiency), and higher operational costs.

### Proliferation and survivorship

Nearly 1,000 active ETFs launched in 2025, but ~150 also closed. Most closures had tiny asset bases --- funds that failed to gain traction. The explosion of launches (85% of 2025 new ETFs were active) raises the bar for differentiation. "New ETFs with good long-term merit are increasingly rare" ([[Morningstar]]).

### Leverage and complexity in retail products

Single-stock leveraged ETFs, options-overlay income products, and 100% buffer ETFs introduce complexity that many retail investors may not fully understand. Daily reset mechanics, cap/floor structures, and options decay create path-dependent returns that diverge from expectations.

## Investment implications

1. The mutual fund-to-ETF migration is structural and irreversible. Tax efficiency alone makes the ETF wrapper superior for taxable accounts. ETF share classes will accelerate this further once [[Dimensional]]'s template scales in 2026.

2. Active ETFs are growing 3x faster than their asset share implies. Flow share (31-36%) will converge toward asset share over years, meaning active ETF AUM could reach $3-5T by 2030.

3. The real winners are the wrapper, not the strategy. Putting an active strategy in an ETF doesn't improve the strategy --- it improves the tax and cost efficiency of delivery. The SPIVA data hasn't changed: most active managers still lose to passive over time.

4. Fixed income is the sweet spot for active ETFs. Bond markets are structurally less efficient than equity markets, and active bond funds have a better track record of outperformance (63% beat rate in 2024). Active fixed income ETF flows should continue to outpace equity.

5. Watch the fee compression. Active ETF expense ratios have been falling as competition intensifies. The firms winning flows ([[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Dimensional]], [[Capital Group]]) charge 0.15-0.35%, well below the 0.49% average. Expensive active products will face margin pressure.
