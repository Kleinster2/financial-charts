**Silver** — Hybrid precious/industrial metal. Solar + electronics demand meets monetary hedge. [[China]] export controls 2026. **+150% in 2025** — strongest year on record.

---

## Current price (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| All-time high | **$93.75/oz** (Jan 15, 2026) |
| Current | ~$88/oz (after pullback) |
| 2025 return | **+150%** (strongest year on record) |
| Start of 2025 | ~$30/oz |
| Gold/silver ratio | ~52x (historically low) |
| 2026 bull target | $100/oz |

**Jan 15, 2026:** Hit $93.75 ATH, then -7.3% profit-taking after Trump held off on critical mineral tariffs.

## Why silver matters

Unique dual demand profile:

| Demand type | Share | Drivers |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Industrial** | ~55% | Solar, electronics, EVs |
| **Investment** | ~25% | Store of value, inflation hedge |
| **Jewelry/silverware** | ~20% | [[Consumer]] discretionary |

Unlike gold (primarily monetary), silver has real industrial consumption.

## 2025 performance

**Record year:**
- **+150%** — from ~$30 to ~$72/oz
- Dramatically outperformed gold
- 40-year technical breakout
- [[China]] export controls catalyzed supply fears

### Rally anatomy

| Phase | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| **2024 H2** | Gold rotation, solar demand |
| **2025 H1** | Short squeeze begins |
| **2025 H2** | Tariff fears → US warehouse hoarding |
| **2026 Jan** | China speculation + Fed fears → $93.75 ATH |

---

## Industrial demand drivers

**Solar/photovoltaic:**
- Silver paste essential for solar cells
- Each GW of solar capacity = ~20 tons silver
- Global solar installations accelerating
- No substitute at scale

| Year | Solar silver demand |
|------|---------------------|
| 2020 | ~100M oz |
| 2023 | ~150M oz |
| 2025 | ~200M oz (est) |

**Risk:** Thrifting (less silver per panel) and substitution efforts.

**Electronics:**
- Best electrical conductor of all metals
- Thermal conductivity applications
- [[5G]] infrastructure, data centers
- EV components

**AI infrastructure:**
- Data center connectivity
- High-performance computing
- Thermal management applications

## [[China]] export controls (2026)

**Major development:**

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Dec 2025 | [[China]] announced silver export controls starting 2026 |

**Implications:**
- [[China]] produces **60-70% of global refined silver**
- Export restrictions exacerbating structural deficit
- Major catalyst for 2025 price surge
- Follows pattern of rare earth, gallium, germanium controls
- Part of broader strategic materials leverage

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for [[China]]'s export control strategy.

## Tariff/warehouse dynamics (Jan 2026)

**US hoarding:**
- Fears of import tariffs on critical minerals
- Silver held in US warehouses instead of exported
- Created artificial tightness globally
- Short squeeze dynamics

**Trump decision (Jan 2026):**
- Held off on broad tariffs
- Will negotiate bilateral agreements
- Price floors floated, not ruled out levies
- "More surgical approach" — TD Securities

---

## Volatility warning

**Ole Hansen (Saxo Bank):**
> "Much of what traders see on the screen reflects forced flows, margin dynamics, option hedging and short covering rather than genuine supply-demand price discovery. In this environment, technical levels lose reliability, stops are easily triggered, and even correct macro views struggle to survive short-term noise."

**Christopher Wong (OCBC):**
> Medium-term narrative "firmly constructive, underpinned by supply shortfalls, industrial consumption and spillover demand from gold." But "velocity of recent moves warrants some near-term caution."

---

## 2026 outlook

**Bull targets:**
- $100/oz widely cited
- 57% of retail investors expect $100+ in 2026
- Continued Fed rate cut expectations supportive
- Supply deficit persisting

**Near-term risks:**
- TD Securities: 13% of COMEX open interest may be sold in index rebalancing
- Could cause "dramatic repricing lower" short-term
- Fed rate hikes (if any) would pressure prices

---

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- Solar demand structural, not cyclical
- Supply constrained (byproduct of copper/zinc mining)
- [[China]] export controls = supply shock (60-70% of refining)
- 40-year breakout — technical momentum
- [[Inflation]] hedge with industrial upside

**Bear case:**
- Industrial demand = recession sensitive
- Higher volatility than gold
- No central bank buying (unlike gold)
- Substitution risk in some applications
- Parabolic moves often correct sharply

## Gold/silver ratio

**Historical context:**

| Period | Ratio | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Historical average | ~60:1 | Long-term mean |
| 2020 peak | 120:1 | COVID dislocation |
| Early 2025 | ~80-85:1 | Before silver surge |
| Current (Jan 2026) | ~35-40:1 | Silver outperformance |

**2025 compression:** Silver's +150% vs gold's gains dramatically compressed the ratio. Now below historical average.

## Investment vehicles

**ETFs:**

| Ticker | Name | Expense |
|--------|------|---------|
| SLV | iShares Silver Trust | 0.50% |
| SIVR | abrdn Physical Silver | 0.30% |
| PSLV | Sprott Physical Silver | 0.60% |

**Miners:**

| Company | Ticker | Type |
|---------|--------|------|
| First Majestic Silver | AG | Primary silver |
| Pan American Silver | PAAS | Primary silver |
| Hecla Mining | HL | Primary silver |
| Wheaton PM | WPM | Streaming (gold + silver) |
| Coeur Mining | CDE | Primary silver |

**Note:** Most silver is byproduct of copper/zinc/lead mining. Primary silver miners have higher leverage to silver price.

---

## Supply dynamics

**Structural deficit:**
- Mine supply: ~800M oz/year
- Total demand: ~1.2B oz/year
- Deficit covered by above-ground stocks (depleting)

**Production sources:**

| Source | Share |
|--------|-------|
| [[Mexico]] | ~25% |
| [[China]] | ~15% |
| Peru | ~15% |
| Other | ~45% |

**Key constraint:** ~70% of silver is byproduct production (copper/zinc/lead mines) — supply doesn't respond quickly to price.

## vs Gold comparison

| Factor | Silver | Gold |
|--------|--------|------|
| Industrial demand | ~55% | <10% |
| Volatility | Higher | Lower |
| Central bank buying | None | Significant |
| [[China]] export risk | Yes (2026) | No |
| Solar exposure | Direct | None |
| Store of value | Yes | Primary use |
