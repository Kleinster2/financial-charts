**Quantum computing** — next computing paradigm. Still pre-commercial but attracting significant investment. Multiple approaches competing, no clear winner.

## Why it matters for investors

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Investment | Billions flowing (Microsoft, Google, [[IBM]], startups) |
| Timeline | Useful applications: 5-15 years (disputed) |
| Public plays | IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave (all speculative) |
| Big tech exposure | Microsoft, Google, [[IBM]], Amazon (Braket) |
| Risk | High — scientific feasibility still debated for some approaches |

## Qubit approaches

| Approach | Players | Pros | Cons |
|----------|---------|------|------|
| **Superconducting** | [[IBM]], Google, Rigetti | Most mature, highest qubit counts | Error-prone, needs extreme cooling |
| **Trapped ion** | IonQ, [[Quantinuum]] | Lower error rates, longer coherence | Slower gate speeds, scaling challenges |
| **Topological** | Microsoft | Theoretically error-resistant | Unproven — MZMs not yet confirmed |
| **Photonic** | [[PsiQuantum]], Xanadu | Room temperature operation | Complex error correction |
| **Neutral atom** | QuEra, Atom Computing | Scalable, flexible | Early stage |
| **Quantum annealing** | D-Wave | Commercial today (optimization) | Not universal quantum computing |

## Key players

### Big tech

| Company | Approach | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| [[Microsoft]] | Topological (Majorana) | Majorana 1 chip (2025), controversial |
| [[Google]] | Superconducting | Willow chip, "quantum supremacy" claims |
| [[IBM]] | Superconducting | 1000+ qubits, Qiskit ecosystem |
| [[Amazon]] | Braket (cloud access) | Platform play, not building own hardware |

### Public pure-plays

| Company | Ticker | Approach | Market cap | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| IonQ | IONQ | Trapped ion | ~$7B | Most valuable pure-play |
| Rigetti | RGTI | Superconducting | ~$3B | Integrated hardware + cloud |
| D-Wave | QBTS | Quantum annealing | ~$2B | Only commercial quantum (narrow use) |

### Private

| Company | Approach | Funding | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| [[PsiQuantum]] | Photonic | $700M+ | [[GlobalFoundries]] partnership |
| [[Quantinuum]] | Trapped ion | [[Honeywell]] spinoff | Merged with Cambridge Quantum |
| QuEra | Neutral atom | $100M+ | Harvard/MIT spinout |

## Investment thesis considerations

**Bull case:**
- Quantum advantage for drug discovery, materials, optimization, cryptography
- Whoever wins captures massive TAM
- Government funding (defense, national security)
- Could obsolete classical computing for specific workloads

**Bear case:**
- Timeline constantly pushed out ("10 years away" for 30 years)
- Error correction unsolved at scale
- Classical algorithms keep improving
- Most public pure-plays are cash-burning, pre-revenue
- Scientific feasibility still debated (Microsoft's topological approach)

**Realistic view:**
- Near-term: quantum as cloud service ([[IBM]], Amazon Braket) for experimentation
- Medium-term: hybrid classical-quantum for specific problems
- Long-term: fault-tolerant universal quantum computing (if achievable)

## Microsoft Majorana 1 (2025)

**Controversial topological approach:**

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Chip | Majorana 1 (Feb 2025) |
| Approach | Topological qubits via Majorana zero modes (MZMs) |
| Theory | MZMs are inherently error-resistant |
| Controversy | Nature editorial: "results do not represent evidence for MZMs" |
| Microsoft claim | Opposite — says it proves topological qubits work |
| Track record | 2021 Nature paper retracted; 2023 experiment criticized |
| Progress | July 2025 data "more indicative" per Cornell researcher |
| Next step | DARPA Quantum Benchmarking Initiative finalist |

**Key quote:** "Fundamental physics does not respect the timelines set by big tech companies." — Henry Legg, University of St Andrews

**Investment read:** Microsoft's quantum bet is high-risk, high-reward. If topological qubits work, they leapfrog competitors. If not, years of investment wasted. Scientific consensus still skeptical.

## What to watch

| [[Signal]] | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Error rates | Decreasing below threshold | Plateau |
| Qubit counts | Scaling with quality | Quantity without quality |
| Commercial applications | Real revenue | Perpetual "demos" |
| Microsoft MZM proof | Independent replication | Continued skepticism |
| Google/[[IBM]] roadmaps | On track | Delays |
