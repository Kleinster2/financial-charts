**Travel recovery** — Post-COVID normalization of leisure and business travel. Uneven by segment (luxury strong, economy weak) and geography (domestic recovered, some international lagging).

---

## Recovery timeline

| Phase | Period | Characteristics |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Collapse** | Mar-May 2020 | -60% hotel occupancy, airlines grounded |
| **Domestic leisure** | Summer 2020 | Drive-to destinations, outdoor focus |
| **Pent-up demand** | 2021-2022 | Revenge travel, luxury surge |
| **Business travel lag** | 2022-2023 | Hybrid work slowed recovery |
| **Normalization** | 2024-2025 | RevPAR flat, segment bifurcation |

---

## 2025 state of play

**US hotel metrics (2025):**

| Metric | Value | vs 2019 |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Occupancy | 63.4% | -2.4 pts |
| ADR | ~$160 | +15% |
| RevPAR | ~$101 | +10% |

Occupancy still below 2019; ADR gains drove RevPAR recovery.

---

## Segment bifurcation

| Segment | 2025 RevPAR | Trend |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Luxury | +5.3% | Strong |
| Upper-upscale | +2% | Stable |
| Midscale | -0.5% | Weak |
| Economy | -1.8% | Struggling |

**Why:** High-income travelers resilient; inflation pressuring budget travelers. Luxury hotels (ADR ~$273) outperforming economy (ADR ~$87).

## Geographic divergence

| Market | Status | Driver |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **US domestic** | Recovered | Leisure strong |
| **Europe inbound** | Strong | Dollar strength, tourism |
| **Asia-Pacific** | Recovering | China reopening slow |
| **Canada → US** | -24% YTD | Tariff tensions |

Canadian inbound collapse is 2025's biggest headwind — historically largest source of US visitors.

---

## Business travel

**Still 10-15% below 2019 levels** for many markets.

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Hybrid work | Fewer routine trips |
| Video conferencing | Replaced some meetings |
| Cost scrutiny | Corporate travel budgets tight |
| Large events | Recovering (conventions, conferences) |

Group/convention business returning faster than individual business travel.

---

## 2026 catalysts

1. **FIFA World Cup (US)** — major inbound travel driver
2. **Supply moderation** — fewer new hotels = pricing power
3. **Business travel normalization** — hybrid stabilizing
4. **International recovery** — ex-Canada

---

## Investment implications

| Play | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Luxury hotels** | Resilient demand, pricing power |
| **Asset-light (HLT, MAR)** | Fee-based, less capital risk |
| **Avoid economy** | Segment struggling |
| **Airlines cautious** | Capacity discipline matters |
