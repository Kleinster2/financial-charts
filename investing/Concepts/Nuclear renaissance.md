**Nuclear Renaissance** — Nuclear re-rated as AI infrastructure. Microsoft TMI deal catalyst.

---

## The thesis

AI is reviving nuclear power:

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Microsoft TMI deal (Sept 2024) | First restart for AI |
| Constellation +150% (2024) | Nuclear re-rated |
| Vistra +260% (2024) | Best S&P 500 stock |
| SMR interest | Long-term optionality |

---

## Why AI needs nuclear

| Factor | Nuclear advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Baseload | 24/7 reliability |
| Carbon | Zero emissions |
| Density | Massive power, small footprint |
| Duration | 40+ year assets |
| PPA structure | Long-term contracts |

Data centers need reliable, clean power.

---

## The catalyst

**Microsoft Three Mile Island (Sept 2024):**
- Restart TMI Unit 1
- 20-year PPA
- 835 MW dedicated
- First nuclear restart for AI
- [[Signal]] to market

---

## Project Stargate Ecosystem

**[[Project Stargate]] ($500B AI Infra)** is the massive demand shock that validates the nuclear thesis beyond single-reactor restarts.

| Player | Role in Stargate | Thesis Connection |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **[[Oklo]]** | **SMR Provider** | [[Sam Altman]] ([[OpenAI]] CEO) is Chairman. Likely preferred SMR partner for long-term buildout. |
| **[[Constellation Energy]]** | **Operator** | Only US operator with scale to manage the gigawatt-class nuclear fleet Stargate needs. |
| **[[Cameco]]** | **Fuel Supplier** | Massive new reactor demand tightens uranium market; owns 49% of Westinghouse (AP1000 tech). |
| **[[Westinghouse]]** | **Reactor Tech** | AP1000 is the only proven Gen III+ tech for immediate large-scale deployment. |
| **[[BWX Technologies]]** | **Components** | Key supplier for reactor pressure vessels and SMR components. |

**The [[Trump II]] Kicker:** Administration's deregulation push (NRC reform) is essential to meet Stargate's aggressive 2028-2030 timelines.

## 2024 performance

| Stock | 2024 Return | Driver |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [[Constellation Energy]] | +150% | TMI deal, 21 reactors |
| [[Vistra]] | +260% | Texas nuclear + AI |
| [[Cameco]] | +30% | Uranium demand |

Best-performing sector in market.

---

## Winners

**Operating nuclear:**
- [[Constellation Energy]] — largest US fleet
- [[Vistra]] — Texas nuclear + gas

**Uranium:**
- [[Cameco]] — mining, Westinghouse stake
- [[Centrus Energy]] — HALEU enrichment

**SMR (speculative):**
- [[NuScale]] — only NRC-approved
- [[Oklo]] — [[Sam Altman]] backed

## January 2026 developments

### US policy

| Development | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **DOE uranium contracts** | **$2.7B** for domestic enriched uranium — largest investment in US nuclear fuel capacity |
| **Trump executive orders** | 4 EOs to strengthen nuclear, called for 10 new reactors, NRC reform |
| **DOE reorganization** | Eliminated Grid Deployment Office, Office of Clean Energy Demos (Dec 2025) |

### Hyperscaler deals

| Company | Nuclear commitment |
|---------|-------------------|
| **[[Meta]]** | **6.6 GW** by 2035 (Constellation, Vistra, [[TerraPower]], Oklo) |
| [[Microsoft]] | TMI restart (835 MW) |
| [[Amazon]] | [[Talen Energy]], X-Energy SMR investments |
| [[Oracle]] | Exploring nuclear for data centers |

Meta emerging as one of largest corporate nuclear buyers in US history.

### State initiatives

**New York:** Gov. Hochul announced plans for **4 GW** new nuclear reactors — more than entire US has built in 30 years.

### [[EU]] reversal

| Country | Policy change |
|---------|---------------|
| **Belgium** | Reversed nuclear phase-out |
| **Italy** | Lifted nuclear ban |
| **[[Germany]]** | Recognized nuclear as green energy |
| **[[Switzerland]]** | Reconsidering anti-nuclear stance |
| **Denmark** | Actively reconsidering |

**[[EU]] total:** 81.2 GW nuclear capacity targeted by 2040.

### Global pipeline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reactors under construction | **71** globally |
| US reactors planned | 10 |
| Operating reactors | 441 |

## SMR optionality

**Small Modular Reactors:**
- Factory-built, modular
- On-site for data centers
- 2030s deployment
- High risk, high reward

Hyperscalers interested but patient.

---

## Investment implications

**Long operating nuclear:**
- Constellation, Vistra
- Immediate AI demand
- Already re-rated but more upside

**Long uranium:**
- Cameco, Centrus
- Supply constrained
- All nuclear benefits

**Speculative SMR:**
- NuScale, Oklo
- Long timeline
- Binary outcomes

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Already up 150-260% | Valuation |
| Regulatory | Restart approvals |
| Execution | TMI restart timeline |
| SMR delays | 2030s+ |

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Constellation 2024 | +150% |
| Vistra 2024 | +260% |
| TMI restart | 2028 target |
| SMR timeline | 2030s |
