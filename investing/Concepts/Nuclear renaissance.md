**Nuclear Renaissance** — Nuclear re-rated as AI infrastructure. Microsoft TMI deal catalyst.

---

## The thesis

AI is reviving nuclear power:

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Microsoft TMI deal (Sept 2024) | First restart for AI |
| Constellation +150% (2024) | Nuclear re-rated |
| Vistra +260% (2024) | Best S&P 500 stock |
| SMR interest | Long-term optionality |

---

## Why AI needs nuclear

| Factor | Nuclear advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Baseload | 24/7 reliability |
| Carbon | Zero emissions |
| Density | Massive power, small footprint |
| Duration | 40+ year assets |
| PPA structure | Long-term contracts |

Data centers need reliable, clean power.

## The catalyst

**Microsoft Three Mile Island (Sept 2024):**
- Restart TMI Unit 1
- 20-year PPA
- 835 MW dedicated
- First nuclear restart for AI
- Signal to market

## Project Stargate Ecosystem

**[[Project Stargate]] ($500B AI Infra)** is the massive demand shock that validates the nuclear thesis beyond single-reactor restarts.

| Player | Role in Stargate | Thesis Connection |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **[[Oklo]]** | **SMR Provider** | Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) is Chairman. Likely preferred SMR partner for long-term buildout. |
| **[[Constellation Energy]]** | **Operator** | Only US operator with scale to manage the gigawatt-class nuclear fleet Stargate needs. |
| **[[Cameco]]** | **Fuel Supplier** | Massive new reactor demand tightens uranium market; owns 49% of Westinghouse (AP1000 tech). |
| **[[Westinghouse]]** | **Reactor Tech** | AP1000 is the only proven Gen III+ tech for immediate large-scale deployment. |
| **[[BWX Technologies]]** | **Components** | Key supplier for reactor pressure vessels and SMR components. |

**The Trump II Kicker:** Administration's deregulation push (NRC reform) is essential to meet Stargate's aggressive 2028-2030 timelines.

## 2024 performance

| Stock | 2024 Return | Driver |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [[Constellation Energy]] | +150% | TMI deal, 21 reactors |
| [[Vistra]] | +260% | Texas nuclear + AI |
| [[Cameco]] | +30% | Uranium demand |

Best-performing sector in market.

---

## Winners

**Operating nuclear:**
- [[Constellation Energy]] — largest US fleet
- [[Vistra]] — Texas nuclear + gas

**Uranium:**
- [[Cameco]] — mining, Westinghouse stake
- [[Centrus Energy]] — HALEU enrichment

**SMR (speculative):**
- [[NuScale]] — only NRC-approved
- [[Oklo]] — Sam Altman backed

---

## SMR optionality

**Small Modular Reactors:**
- Factory-built, modular
- On-site for data centers
- 2030s deployment
- High risk, high reward

Hyperscalers interested but patient.

---

## Investment implications

**Long operating nuclear:**
- Constellation, Vistra
- Immediate AI demand
- Already re-rated but more upside

**Long uranium:**
- Cameco, Centrus
- Supply constrained
- All nuclear benefits

**Speculative SMR:**
- NuScale, Oklo
- Long timeline
- Binary outcomes

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Already up 150-260% | Valuation |
| Regulatory | Restart approvals |
| Execution | TMI restart timeline |
| SMR delays | 2030s+ |

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Constellation 2024 | +150% |
| Vistra 2024 | +260% |
| TMI restart | 2028 target |
| SMR timeline | 2030s |
