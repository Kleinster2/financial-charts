**Build-to-rent (BTR)** — Purpose-built single-family rental communities. Industry's answer to political heat over buying existing homes. 39,000 deliveries in 2024 (+455% vs 2019). Now 7% of single-family construction starts.

## Market size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2024 deliveries | **39,000 homes** |
| Growth vs 2019 | **+455%** |
| BTR starts (12mo to Jun 2025) | 71,000 units |

## Why BTR exists

**Political cover:** Buying existing homes = "taking homes from families." Building new = adding to supply.

| Strategy | Political heat | Supply impact |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Buy existing homes | High | Zero-sum |
| Build-to-rent | Low | Adds supply |

**Economic logic:**
- Scalable (entire communities, not one-off purchases)
- Modern construction (efficient, uniform)
- Purpose-designed for rental operations
- Geographic flexibility
