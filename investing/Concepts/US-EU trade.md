If activated, targets ~€93B of US exports:

| Product | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Boeing aircraft** | Alternative: Airbus |
| **Soy** | Alternative: Brazil, Argentina |
| **Whiskey** | Trump supporter industry |
| **Motorcycles** (Harley-Davidson) | Trump supporter industry |

2. Products hitting Trump's political base

## EU Anti-Coercion Instrument ("the bazooka")

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Created | 2023 |
| Used | Never (as of Jan 2026) |
| Trigger | Economic coercion by foreign power |
| Scope | Broader than tariffs |

**Potential measures if activated:**
- Tariffs
- Intellectual property restrictions
- Market access restrictions for US companies (e.g., communications sector)

**Why "bazooka":** Like ECB's OMT or Germany's €500B fiscal fund — a powerful tool held in reserve as deterrent, designed to never be fired but credible enough to change behavior.

**Status:** Macron has suggested activating it in response to Greenland/tariff pressure.

## Tariff threat details (Jan 2026)

| Target | Feb 1, 2026 | Jun 1, 2026 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 6 EU countries | 10% | 25% |
| Norway | 10% | 25% |
| UK | 10% | 25% |

Tariffs linked to opposition to US Greenland annexation.

## WTO implications

US actions have paralyzed WTO dispute settlement system:
- Appellate Body non-functional (US blocks judge appointments)
- Bilateral deals like Turnberry operate outside WTO framework
- Rules-based trading system under strain

---

## Potential beneficiaries

**EU-Mercosur agreement:** Trade tensions may accelerate ratification as EU seeks alternative partners and supply sources.

**Airbus:** Boeing retaliation would benefit European competitor.

**Brazil/Argentina:** Soy retaliation redirects demand.
