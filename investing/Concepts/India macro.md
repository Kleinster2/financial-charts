## Macro outlook — Jan 2026

**Arvind Subramanian (former Chief Economic Adviser):** GDP 7.4% figure "should be read cautiously."

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Deflator issues | Unusually low, may overstate real growth |
| Nominal indicators | Decelerating |
| High-frequency data | Slowing |
| US [[Trade]] deal | Stalled; EU deal closed Jan 27 |
| Chinese dumping | "Mercantilism" — low-cost goods flooding India |
| Fiscal position | Weaker than should be (GST cuts) |
| [[Indian rupee]] | -5% past year, past 91/$ |
| RBI | Intervention "above what is needed" |

**Quote:** "If growth next year ends up similar to this year, India should consider itself fortunate."

## Reserve diversification — Treasuries → Gold

![[india-treasuries-vs-gold-reserves.png]]
*[[Treasuries]] · [[Gold]]*

| Metric | Peak | Current | Change |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| US Treasury holdings | ~$235B (2023 peak) | **$174B** (five-year low) | **-26%** |
| Treasuries as % of FX reserves | 40% (year prior) | **33%** | -7pp |
| Gold in FX reserves | ~$25B (2019) | **~$100B** (2025) | ~4x |

**Dual motivation:**
1. **Rupee defense** — selling Treasuries funds rupee purchases (record lows after 50% tariffs, stalled trade deal)
2. **Sanctions risk** — post-2022 [[Russia]] freeze + India's continued Russian oil purchases made it a target

Finance Minister Sitharaman confirmed (Sep 2025) RBI taking a "very considered decision" to diversify.

**Context:** India holds $174B vs China ~$683B and [[Japan]] ~$1.2T. Not a major holder, but the trend matters — OMFIF survey (Nov 2025) found ~60% of central banks plan to seek alternatives to dollar in next 1-2 years. China and [[Brazil]] also cut long-term holdings to record lows (Oct 2025).

**Outlook:** Pepperstone's Michael Brown: even a trade deal will only stabilize holdings, not reverse the trend. Capital Economics (top rupee forecaster): speed of US-India deterioration "jolted policymakers to reduce vulnerabilities."

## Real estate sector stress — Jan 2026

BSE Realty Index down **>30%** from June 2024 peak. Oberoi Realty missed Q3 FY26 forecasts (sales, profit, residential margins) → sector-wide selloff.

![[india-construction-completions.png]]

**Core problem:** Builders launching projects but failing to complete them.

| Metric | FY 2017 | FY 2026 (Q1) |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Marketable supply | 3.3M sq ft | 3.6M sq ft |
| Completions | 2.4M sq ft (74%) | 2.0M sq ft (**57%**) |

Slower construction → delayed revenue recognition, higher execution risk, potential defaults (Liases Foras, Nov 2025).

**Demand picture:**
- Unsold inventory: 19 months (lightest in 2.5 years) — not a glut problem
- Nationwide sales growth peaked
- $1M+ homes (Mumbai luxury) propping up market; middle-class affordability weakening
- White-collar wages pressured by AI + geopolitical uncertainty

**Supply constraints:**
- Delhi: air pollution construction bans
- Mumbai: environmental clearance delays
- Skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, carpenters) earning more in gig economy
- Women (11% of construction workforce) leaving for cash transfer programs

**Pre-sales model risk:** Builders collecting booking amounts before construction begins. If completions continue declining, buyer confidence in financially weaker developers could crack — echoing China's pre-sales crisis (though much smaller scale).

**Not yet a crisis:** No liquidity crunch or systemic defaults. Fear has arrived, panic has not.
