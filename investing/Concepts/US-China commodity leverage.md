**US-[[China]] commodity leverage** — Fungible raw materials as bargaining chips. US has Venezuela oil (medium leverage) and agriculture (weak — [[Brazil]]/[[Argentina]] substitutes).

## The asymmetry

| Commodity | Controller | Substitutes? | Leverage |
|-----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Venezuela oil | US (new) | [[Russia]], Middle East, [[Africa]] | **Medium** |
| Soybeans | US was #1 | [[Brazil]] #1 now, [[Argentina]] | **Weak** |
| Other grains | US major | Global suppliers | **Weak** |

**Bottom line:** US commodity leverage is about disruption/cost, not chokehold. [[China]] has alternatives.

## Venezuela oil

Post-Maduro, US controls oil flows [[China]] was receiving:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[China]] was getting | ~300-400K bpd |
| Via | [[CNPC]], [[Sinopec]] refineries |
| [[China]] debt exposure | ~$60B since 2007 |

**US options:**
- Continue flow to [[China]] (maintain relationship)
- Redirect to Gulf Coast refiners (punish)
- Use as bargaining chip (negotiate)

**Weakness:** [[China]] can buy from [[Russia]], Middle East, [[Africa]]. Inconvenient, not fatal.

**Strategic actors:**
- Trump/Bessent — leverage opportunity
- [[CNPC]], [[Sinopec]] — lose supply
- [[Chevron]], Gulf Coast refiners — gain supply

See [[Venezuela]], [[Maduro capture 2026]].

## [[Agriculture]]

| Product | US was | Now |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Soybeans | \#1 supplier to [[China]] | \#2 ([[Brazil]] is \#1) |
| Other grains | Major | Diversified |

**2018 lesson:** [[China]] pivoted to [[Brazil]]/[[Argentina]] during trade war. Never came back fully.

US agricultural leverage is largely spent. [[China]] learned not to depend on US supply.

## Investment implications

**If US restricts Venezuela oil:**
- Gulf Coast refiners benefit ([[Valero]], [[PBF Energy]])
- [[China]] refiners seek alternatives (minimal long-term impact)
- [[Oil]] price volatility short-term
