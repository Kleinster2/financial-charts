## AI demand thesis

**Data centers driving nuclear revival:**

| Source | Projection |
|--------|------------|
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | Data center electricity demand +160% by 2030 |
| Investor survey | 63% believe AI = material factor in nuclear planning |

**Hyperscaler commitments:**
- [[Microsoft]] — nuclear power agreements
- [[Google]] — reactor investments
- [[Amazon]] — nuclear partnerships
- [[Meta]] — exploring nuclear options

AI electricity demand viewed as **structural, not cyclical**.

## Supply deficit

**Structural shortage:**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Mined supply vs demand | <75% of reactor requirements |
| [[Kazatomprom]] (2026) | Reduced production guidance |
| Secondary supply | Declining |
| Permitting timelines | Long (years) |
| Underinvestment | Decades |

## Nuclear capacity expansion

**Reactor pipeline:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2026 new reactors | ~15 |
| 2026 new capacity | ~12 GW |
| Current global capacity | 398 GWe (June 2025) |
| 2040 target (WNA) | 746 GWe (~2x) |

[[China]] leading buildout. See [[China nuclear buildout]].
