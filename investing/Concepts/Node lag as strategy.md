[[TSMC]] intentionally operates overseas fabs **1-2 nodes behind** Taiwan.

## Rationale

- Leading-edge learning stays concentrated in Taiwan's mature ecosystem
- Avoids deploying immature processes in unfamiliar environments
- Reduces execution risk in new geographies

## How it works

| Location | Node timeline |
|----------|---------------|
| Taiwan | 2nm ramping 2025 |
| Arizona Phase 1 | 4nm/5nm mass production 2025 |
| Arizona Phase 2 | 3nm in 2027 |
| Arizona Phase 3 | 2nm in 2028 |

## Contrast with Samsung

- [[Samsung Taylor pivot]]: leapfrog to 2nm mid-construction
- TSMC: sequence, stabilize, then expand

## Implication

Node lag is a **feature**, not a failure. It's deliberate risk management that compounds TSMC's structural advantage.
