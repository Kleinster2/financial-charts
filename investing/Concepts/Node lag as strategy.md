[[TSMC]] intentionally operates overseas fabs **1-2 nodes behind** [[Taiwan]]. This isn't a constraint — it's a strategy.

> **Key insight:** Node lag is a feature, not a failure. It's deliberate risk management that compounds TSMC's structural advantage. Challengers who try to leapfrog take on extreme execution risk.

---

## The strategy

**What TSMC does:**
- [[Ramp]] new nodes in [[Taiwan]] first
- Wait for yields to mature (1-2 years)
- Only then deploy to overseas fabs
- Sequence: [[Taiwan]] → [[Japan]] → Arizona → [[Europe]]

**Why this works:**
- Leading-edge learning stays in mature ecosystem
- Avoids deploying immature processes in unfamiliar environments
- Reduces [[Execution risk in foundries]]
- Protects [[Taiwan]]'s strategic value

## Current node timeline

| Location | Node | Status | Timeline |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| [[Taiwan]] | 2nm | Ramping | 2025 |
| [[Taiwan]] | 3nm | Mature | 2022-present |
| Arizona Phase 1 | 4nm/5nm | Mass production | 2025 |
| Arizona Phase 2 | 3nm | Construction | 2027 |
| Arizona Phase 3 | 2nm | Planned | 2028 |
| [[Japan]] (Kumamoto) | 12-28nm | Production | 2024 |
| [[Germany]] | 28nm | Planned | 2027+ |

**The pattern:** Arizona trails [[Taiwan]] by 2-3 years on each node.

## Why N-2 makes sense

**Risk reduction:**

| Deploying bleeding edge overseas | Risk |
|----------------------------------|------|
| Process still immature | Yield problems |
| Engineers learning on-the-job | Quality issues |
| Suppliers unfamiliar | Supply chain hiccups |
| Customers exposed | Product delays |

**Deploying N-2 overseas:**

| Mature process | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| Yields proven in [[Taiwan]] | Predictable output |
| Engineers trained on stable process | Lower error rate |
| Recipe locked | Supplier alignment |
| Customers confident | Reliable delivery |

## Contrast with [[Samsung]]

**[[Samsung]]'s approach (Taylor, Texas):**

| Decision | Risk level |
|----------|------------|
| Started as 4nm fab | Medium |
| Pivoted to 2nm mid-construction | Extreme |
| Deploying unproven GAA in new geography | Very high |
| Leapfrogging TSMC's sequencing | Maximum risk |

See [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] for details.

**The gamble:** [[Samsung]] hopes the risk pays off with market share. If it fails, they've invested $40B+ in a problem.

## Customer implications

**For customers at overseas fabs:**

| N-2 node | [[Trade]]-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Older technology | Not cutting-edge products |
| Reliable supply | Predictable production |
| Lower risk | Product launches on schedule |
| Mature yields | Competitive pricing |

**Who this works for:**
- [[Automotive]] (doesn't need 2nm)
- IoT, consumer electronics
- [[Defense]] (values reliability)
- Mature product lines

**Who needs [[Taiwan]]:**
- [[Apple]] (latest iPhone chips)
- [[NVIDIA]] (AI GPUs)
- [[AMD]] (latest CPUs)
- Anyone needing absolute leading edge

---

## Strategic value for [[Taiwan]]

**The unspoken logic:**

| If [[Taiwan]] has leading edge exclusively | Implication |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| US/customers dependent on [[Taiwan]] | Political leverage |
| [[Taiwan]]'s security value maximized | "Silicon shield" |
| TSMC's strategic position protected | Premium pricing |

**The balance:** TSMC gives customers *some* geographic diversification while preserving [[Taiwan]]'s strategic importance.

---

## Investment implications

**What node lag signals:**
- TSMC prioritizes execution over speed
- Overseas fabs are insurance, not replacement
- [[Taiwan]] remains the crown jewel
- Risk management > growth maximization

**For TSMC investors:**
- Conservative approach = lower volatility
- Overseas expansion priced as optionality
- [[Taiwan]] risk remains the key variable

**For [[Samsung]]/[[Intel]] investors:**
- Aggressive approaches are higher-variance bets
- Success would be transformative
- Failure would confirm TSMC dominance
