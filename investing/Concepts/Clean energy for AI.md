**Clean Energy for AI** — Countries with renewable grids attracting data centers. Brazil, Chile, Nordics.

---

## The thesis

Renewable energy = data center magnet:

| Country | Renewable % | Advantage |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| [[Brazil AI]] | 93.6% | Hydro dominant |
| Chile | 60%+ | Hydro + solar |
| Norway | 98% | Hydro |
| Iceland | 100% | Geothermal + hydro |

---

## Why clean energy matters

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| ESG pressure | Hyperscalers have targets |
| Carbon costs | EU carbon pricing |
| PR/optics | "Green AI" narrative |
| Cost | Renewables now cheaper |
| Regulation | Some require clean power |

Microsoft, Google, Amazon all have net-zero commitments.

## Brazil's pitch

**93.6% renewable grid:**
- Mostly hydropower
- Solar/wind growing
- Redata tax incentives
- [[São Paulo Data Hub]], [[Fortaleza Data Hub]]

"Clean AI" = Brazil's selling point.

---

## Chile's pitch

**Hydro + Atacama solar:**
- Stable hydropower
- Massive solar potential
- [[Santiago Data Hub]]
- Microsoft 100% renewable by 2025

---

## Nordic advantage

**Natural cooling + hydro:**
- Cold climate = less cooling
- 98%+ renewable (Norway)
- Google, Meta facilities
- [[HAVFRUE Cable]] connectivity

---

## LatAm leads globally

**60%+ renewable for DCs:**
- Latin America leads world
- Brazil, Chile, Colombia
- Hydro legacy infrastructure
- Attracting hyperscalers

---

## Investment implications

**Long clean energy DC hubs:**
- Brazil infrastructure
- Chile data centers
- Nordic operators

**Long renewable developers:**
- Solar/wind in DC regions
- PPA suppliers to hyperscalers

---

## The trade-off

| Clean energy hub | Challenge |
|------------------|-----------|
| Brazil | Infrastructure, connectivity |
| Chile | Water for cooling (some regions) |
| Nordics | Distance from users |
| Iceland | Very remote |

Clean energy ≠ perfect location.

---

## Hyperscaler commitments

| Company | Target |
|---------|--------|
| [[Google]] | 24/7 carbon-free by 2030 |
| [[Microsoft]] | Carbon negative by 2030 |
| [[Amazon]] | Net-zero by 2040 |
| [[Meta]] | Net-zero by 2030 |

Driving demand for clean DC locations.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Brazil renewable | 93.6% |
| Chile renewable | 60%+ |
| LatAm DC renewable | 60%+ (world-leading) |
| Hyperscaler targets | 2030 net-zero |
