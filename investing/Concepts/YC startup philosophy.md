#concept #startups #framework

**YC startup philosophy** — The operating system for startups, codified by [[Paul Graham]] and taught at [[Y Combinator]]. Now the default framework for Silicon Valley. Core ideas: make something people want, do things that don't scale, ramen profitable, default alive.

---

## Why this matters

These ideas have spread far beyond YC:
- 5,300+ YC companies were trained on them
- Paul Graham's essays are read by every founder
- Non-YC startups adopt the same playbook
- The vocabulary ("pivot," "ramen profitable") became universal

**The framework outlives both the person and the company.**

## Core mantras

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **"Make something people want"** | The only thing that matters. If you don't, you die. |
| **"Do things that don't scale"** | Manual effort first, automation later. |
| **"Launch early"** | Launching too slowly kills 100x more startups than launching too fast. |
| **"Talk to users"** | Constant feedback. Don't build in a vacuum. |

---

## Survival concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Ramen profitable** | Making just enough to pay founders' living expenses. Not the destination — a trick for not dying en route. |
| **Default alive vs default dead** | Can you reach profitability with current cash? The first question to ask. |

**Why ramen profitable matters:** Buys time. Removes desperation. Better negotiating position with investors. Turns "default dead" into "default alive."

## "Do things that don't scale" — explained

Founders think they need scalable systems from day one. They build automation before they have customers. Then wonder why nobody uses it.

**The insight:** Startups don't grow on their own. You have to manually push them into existence.

| Company | Unscalable thing | What it became |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **[[Airbnb]]** | Founders flew to NYC, photographed listings themselves | Professional photography program |
| **[[Stripe]]** | "Collison installation" — founders came to your office, set up Stripe for you | Self-serve integration |
| **[[DoorDash]]** | Founders personally delivered food | Dasher network |
| **Wufoo** | Handwritten thank-you notes to users | Customer love culture |
| **Pinterest** | Founders recruited users one by one at coffee shops | Viral growth |

**Why it works:**
- You learn what users actually want — can't learn from a dashboard
- Users feel special — they become evangelists
- Tight feedback loop → find product-market fit faster
- Gets the flywheel started — once spinning, it scales itself

**The trap:** Founders use "that won't scale" as an excuse to avoid hard, manual work. But the hard work is how you earn the right to scale.

## Counterintuitive advice

| Conventional wisdom | YC view |
|--------------------|---------|
| Intelligence is key | **Determination** matters more |
| Plan the company | Focus on building something useful — company comes later |
| Think of startup ideas | Look for **problems**, preferably your own |
| Polish before launch | Launch ugly MVPs — speed wins |
| Hire experienced people | Fund hackers, not MBAs |
| Wait for ideal conditions | Younger founders are fine |
| Delegate to professionals | Stay hands-on ("Founder Mode") |

## Key concepts coined

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ramen profitable** | Making just enough to survive |

| **Schlep blindness** | Founders avoid hard, unglamorous problems |
| **The Blub paradox** | Programmers can't see languages above their current level |
| **Frighteningly ambitious** | The best startup ideas seem crazy at first |
| **Founder mode** | Founders should stay hands-on, not over-delegate |

## How the philosophy spread

1. **[[Paul Graham]]** wrote essays based on patterns he saw
2. **[[Y Combinator]]** taught these ideas to each batch
3. **Hacker News** (PG's forum) amplified the essays
4. **YC alumni** spread the ideas to their networks
5. **Non-YC founders** read the essays, adopted the framework
6. **The vocabulary became universal** — "pivot," "ramen profitable," "default alive"

Today, founders who've never heard of Paul Graham use his concepts. The ideas escaped their origin.
