**High yield bonds** (junk bonds) — corporate debt rated BB+ or below by S&P/Fitch (Ba1 or below by Moody's). Higher default risk, higher yields. A key risk-on/risk-off barometer.

## Rating scale

| Grade | S&P/Fitch | Moody's | Category |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Investment grade | AAA to BBB- | Aaa to Baa3 | Lower risk |
| **High yield** | **BB+ to D** | **Ba1 to C** | **Higher risk** |

The BB/Ba boundary is critical — many institutional investors can only hold investment grade, so downgrades trigger forced selling.

## Why high yield exists

Companies issue junk bonds because:
- Too leveraged for investment grade
- Cyclical/volatile earnings
- Smaller, less established
- Funding LBOs and M&A
- Fallen angels (downgraded from IG)

Investors buy them for yield pickup over Treasuries and IG corporates.

## Key ETFs

| Ticker | Name | AUM | Yield | Notes |
|--------|------|-----|-------|-------|
| **HYG** | iShares iBoxx $ High Yield | ~$15B | ~6-7% | Most liquid, benchmark |
| **JNK** | SPDR Bloomberg High Yield | ~$8B | ~6-7% | Similar to HYG |
| **USHY** | iShares Broad USD High Yield | ~$10B | ~6-7% | Broader index |
| **SHYG** | iShares 0-5 Year High Yield | ~$5B | ~6% | Short duration |
| **HYLD** | High Yield ETF (active) | — | — | Active management |

**HYG vs JNK:** Nearly identical exposures. HYG slightly more liquid, JNK slightly higher yield historically.

## Default rates

| Environment | Default rate | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Expansion | 1-2% | 2017-2019 |
| Late cycle | 2-4% | 2015-2016 (energy) |
| Recession | 8-12% | 2008-2009, 2020 |
| Severe crisis | 12%+ | 2009 peak |

**Current (2025):** ~2% — benign, supported by strong corporate earnings.

Default rates lag the cycle — they rise AFTER recession starts, peak AFTER recession ends.

## Spread dynamics

High yield spread = HY yield - Treasury yield

| Spread level | Signal |
|--------------|--------|
| < 300 bps | Tight — risk-on, potential complacency |
| 300-450 bps | Normal |
| 450-600 bps | Elevated — stress emerging |
| > 800 bps | Crisis — recession pricing |

See [[Credit spreads]] for detailed spread analysis.

## Fallen angels

Investment grade bonds downgraded to junk. Critical dynamic because:
- IG funds forced to sell (mandate constraints)
- HY funds may not have capacity to absorb
- Creates technical selling pressure
- Often overshoots fundamental value

**2020 example:** Ford, Macy's, Occidental downgraded — massive supply into HY market.

**Rising stars:** The reverse — HY upgraded to IG. Creates demand as IG funds can buy.

## Sector composition

Typical HY index breakdown:

| Sector | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Communications | ~20% |
| Consumer cyclical | ~15% |
| Energy | ~12% |
| Healthcare | ~10% |
| Industrials | ~10% |
| Other | ~33% |

Energy swings matter — 2015-2016 HY stress was largely shale defaults.

## Economic cycle behavior

| Cycle phase | HY performance |
|-------------|----------------|
| Early recovery | Strong — spreads compress, prices rise |
| Mid cycle | Good — carry dominates, low defaults |
| Late cycle | Vulnerable — spreads start widening |
| Recession | Poor — defaults spike, spreads blow out |

**Key insight:** HY returns are equity-like in downturns. Don't expect bond-like protection.

## HY vs equities

High yield sits between stocks and bonds:
- Correlated with equities (~0.6-0.7 correlation with S&P 500)
- Less volatile than stocks
- More volatile than IG bonds
- Credit selection matters more than duration

In 2008: HY fell ~26%, S&P fell ~38%. Protection, but not safety.

## Interest rate sensitivity

Lower duration than IG bonds (typically 4-5 years vs 7-8 years) because:
- Shorter maturities
- Higher coupons
- Call features

**Implication:** HY less sensitive to rate rises than IG. Spread moves dominate rate moves.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US HY market size | ~$1.5T |
| Average yield | ~7% (2025) |
| Average spread | ~300 bps (tight) |
| Average duration | ~4 years |
| Default rate | ~2% (current) |
