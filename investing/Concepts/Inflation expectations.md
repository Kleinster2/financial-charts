**Inflation expectations** — What households, businesses, and markets believe future inflation will be. Central to monetary policy because expectations can become self-fulfilling. "Anchored" expectations = Fed credibility intact.

---

## Why they matter

Expectations shape actual inflation:
- **Workers** demand higher wages if they expect prices to rise
- **Businesses** raise prices preemptively if they expect costs to increase
- **Investors** demand higher yields if they expect currency debasement

If expectations become "unanchored" (people lose faith in 2% target), inflation becomes much harder to control — requires painful Volcker-style tightening.

**Anchored expectations** = people believe Fed will maintain price stability regardless of short-term deviations. This is the Fed's credibility.

## Two types of measures

### Survey-based

| Survey | Source | Horizon | Jan 2026 |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Michigan 1-year** | U of Michigan | 1 year | 4.0% |
| **Michigan 5-year** | U of Michigan | 5 years | 3.3% |
| **NY Fed SCE** | NY Fed | 1 year | ~3-4% |
| **SPF** | Philadelphia Fed | Various | ~2.5% |

**Pros:** Captures actual beliefs of consumers/forecasters
**Cons:** Volatile, influenced by gas prices, sample biases

### Market-based (breakevens)

| Measure | Calculation | Jan 2026 |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **5-year breakeven** | 5Y Treasury - 5Y TIPS | 2.42% |
| **10-year breakeven** | 10Y Treasury - 10Y TIPS | ~2.3% |
| **5Y5Y forward** | Expected 5Y inflation starting 5Y from now | ~2.2% |

**Pros:** Real-time, market prices reflect actual positions
**Cons:** Include liquidity/risk premiums, not pure expectations

## Fed's preferred measures

The Fed maintains an **Index of Common Inflation Expectations (CIE)** combining 21 measures to filter noise.

**"Well-anchored"** = longer-term measures (5Y5Y forward, Michigan 5-year) remain near 2%, even if short-term measures spike.

## Current state (Jan 2026)

| Timeframe | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Short-term (1Y)** | Elevated (4% Michigan) — tariff concerns |
| **Long-term (5Y+)** | Anchored (3.3% Michigan, 2.4% breakevens) |

**Powell (Jan 29, 2026):** Pointed to anchored long-term expectations as proof Fed credibility intact, dismissing gold/silver rally as loss of confidence signal:

> "If you look at where inflation expectations are, our credibility is right where it needs to be."

Short-term expectations spiked around Liberation Day (tariffs) but have "fully retraced" per Powell.

## Historical context

| Period | Expectations | Outcome |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **1970s** | Unanchored | Inflation spiral, required Volcker shock |
| **1980s-2020** | Anchored at ~2% | "Great Moderation" |
| **2021-2022** | Tested but held | Inflation spiked to 9%, expectations stayed ~3-4% |
| **2025-2026** | Anchored despite tariffs | Fed's key defense |

## Why gold/dollar don't disprove anchoring

[[Jerome Powell]]'s argument (Jan 2026): Gold at record highs and dollar at 4-year lows could signal loss of confidence in USD. But if that were true, inflation expectations would be unanchored — people would expect dollar debasement.

Since long-term expectations remain near 2%, Powell argues the moves reflect:
- Portfolio diversification
- Geopolitical hedging
- Tariff uncertainty

...not fundamental loss of faith in Fed/dollar.

*Counterargument:* Expectations are backward-looking; markets may be leading indicator.
