**Plan México** — [[Claudia Sheinbaum]]'s flagship pro-investment program, launched as economic antidote to US trade tensions. Seeks to provide tax incentives, encourage infrastructure spending, and drive creation of development hubs across [[Mexico]]. As of Feb 2026, struggling to get off the ground.

---

## Design

- Tax incentives for domestic and foreign investment
- Infrastructure spending in strategic sectors
- Development hubs around the country (energy, manufacturing, tech)
- Import substitution — reducing dependence on Chinese inputs
- Film industry incentives (announced Feb 2026)

## Amador investment blueprint (Feb 4, 2026)

Finance Minister Édgar Amador unveiled at Sheinbaum's morning press conference:

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Total | 5.6T pesos (~$323B) through 2030 |
| Projects | ~1,500 |
| Additionality | 722B pesos beyond 2026 budget |
| Sectors | Oil & gas, transport (railways, roads, ports) |
| Structure | Mostly government spending, also seeking private capital |
| Vehicles | Bill going to Congress to define fully public and mixed (public-private) structures |
| Joint ventures | Some projects as JVs with state majority stake (per Banobras director Jorge Mendoza) |

Follow-on announcements:
- [[Pemex]] oil projects investment plan (Feb 5)
- Domestic natural gas increase details (following week) — Mexico has relied on US gas imports for most of national demand for decades

Amador's GDP forecast: 2.5-3% for 2026 — far more optimistic than economist consensus (1.4%). Sheinbaum downplayed growth as a benchmark, saying wealth distribution was never considered in prior growth-focused eras.

Energy-specific challenge: mixed contract scheme for oil unveiled in 2025 has yet to attract significant interest from private oil majors.

## Investment announcements

~30 large announcements in 2025:

| Company | Pledge | Period |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Cox Energy | $10.7B | 2025-2030 |
| [[Walmart]] | Undisclosed | — |
| [[Sempra]] | Undisclosed | — |
| [[Mercado Libre]] | Undisclosed | — |
| [[Heineken]] | Undisclosed | — |

Problem: many of these initiatives have not gotten off the ground as of Feb 2026.

## Promotion gap

[[AMLO]] dismantled ProMéxico, the country's investment-promotion agency, and slashed the diplomatic budget. No replacement created. Mexico now relies on photo-ops with visiting CEOs at the National Palace and occasional investment announcements at the morning press conference — no active investor courtship.

Davos Jan 2026: Mexico largely absent from WEF. Sheinbaum did not attend. Sent one cabinet member — environmental secretary Alicia Bárcena (spoke on "prosperity within planetary boundaries"). Altagracia Gómez (Sheinbaum's business council coordinator) also attended but is not a government official. Only 7 Mexican business leaders registered vs Brazil's 24.

Contrast: Oct 2025, WEF brought delegation of 60 top executives led by [[BlackRock]]'s [[Larry Fink]] to meet Sheinbaum — drawn by signals of more business-friendly posture post-AMLO.

Sheinbaum has made only 5 short foreign trips in ~16 months in office. Has not visited the White House. Has not left the Americas.

Banxico Governor Victoria Rodríguez has been conspicuously unwilling to meet investors, financial analysts, or attend central banker gatherings.

Government-business relations increasingly strained. Executives privately point to judicial reform and incoming electoral rewrite as sources of uncertainty. Major corporate names (Slim family, [[Bimbo]], [[Cemex]], [[Femsa]]) not acting as public champions for Mexico investment.

## Obstacles

- Judicial reform (2024) — business leaders say Plan México fails to offset the legal uncertainty from [[AMLO]]'s judicial overhaul. Incoming electoral rewrite adds further uncertainty
- AMLO legacy — nationalist energy policies, heavier government role in key sectors. Business confidence damaged. ProMéxico dismantled
- Budget deficit — inherited from AMLO, constraining public investment. Double-digit YoY drops in public investment under Sheinbaum
- Infrastructure gaps — development hubs being proposed in locations with insufficient infrastructure or human capital
- [[USMCA]] uncertainty — 2026 review approaching, Trump privately musing about exiting the pact. USMCA focus is crowding out broader investment promotion
- FDI quality — record $41B FDI through Q3 2025, but only $6.5B was completely new projects
- Energy — mixed contract scheme (2025) has not attracted private oil majors

## Sheinbaum's response (Jan 2026)

Privately concerned about stagnation. Met with economists and bankers including Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid (UNAM) and Mariana Rangel Padilla (ITESM). Told them Mexico is not growing fast enough, asked what can be done. Economists underscored need to support energy projects and promote SME growth.
