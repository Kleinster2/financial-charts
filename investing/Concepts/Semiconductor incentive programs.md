**Semiconductor incentive programs** — Global race to subsidize chip manufacturing and AI infrastructure. $200B+ committed worldwide. Reshaping where chips get made.

## The subsidy race

Every major economy now has chip incentives:

| Program | Country | Size | Focus |
|---------|---------|------|-------|
| [[CHIPS Act]] | USA | $52B | Manufacturing + R&D |
| EU Chips Act | Europe | €43B | Sovereignty, 20% global share goal |
| K-CHIPS Act | Korea | $470B (incl. private) | Memory, foundry |
| Japan subsidies | Japan | $13B+ | Rapidus, TSMC Kumamoto |
| India PLI | India | $10B | Electronics, packaging |
| RIGI | Argentina | Tax breaks | Large investments ($200M+) |
| China Big Fund | China | $40B+ (3 phases) | Self-sufficiency |

---

## USA: CHIPS Act

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total | $52B |
| Manufacturing | $39B direct subsidies |
| R&D | $13B |
| Key recipients | Intel, TSMC, Samsung, Micron |
| Guardrails | No China expansion for 10 years |

See [[CHIPS Act]] for full details.

**Status**: Funding flowing, projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, Texas.

---

## Europe: EU Chips Act

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total | €43B ($47B) |
| Goal | 20% global chip production by 2030 |
| Key projects | Intel Germany, TSMC Dresden |
| Focus | Automotive, industrial chips |

**Challenge**: Starting from ~9% share, 20% goal may be unrealistic.

---

## Korea: K-CHIPS Act

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total | $470B (public + private to 2042) |
| Tax credits | 25% for large firms, 35% for SMEs |
| Focus | Memory ([[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]]), foundry |
| Key clusters | Yongin, Pyeongtaek |

**Advantage**: Building on existing dominance, not starting from scratch.

---

## Japan: Chip subsidies

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total | $13B+ and growing |
| Key projects | Rapidus (2nm), TSMC Kumamoto |
| Partners | IBM (Rapidus), Sony/Denso (TSMC) |
| Goal | Rebuild domestic manufacturing |

See [[Rapidus]], [[Japan Semiconductor Revival]].

---

## India: PLI Scheme

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total | $10B |
| Focus | Assembly, packaging, displays |
| Key projects | Tata-PSMC fab (Gujarat) |
| Limitation | No leading-edge, starts with mature nodes |

India targeting downstream, not frontier manufacturing.

---

## Argentina: RIGI

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Threshold | $200M+ foreign investment |
| Benefits | Import tax breaks, FX benefits, 30-year stability |
| Focus | Data centers, AI infrastructure |
| Key project | [[Project Stargate]] ($25B) |

See [[Argentina]] for context.

---

## China: Big Fund

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Phase I | $21B (2014) |
| Phase II | $29B (2019) |
| Phase III | $47B (2024) |
| Focus | Self-sufficiency under [[Export controls]] |
| Key targets | [[SMIC]], [[CXMT]], equipment |

**Constraint**: Export controls limit what money can buy.

## Comparison matrix

| Program | Scale | Leading edge? | Execution |
|---------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **USA** | $52B | Yes (Intel, TSMC) | Strong |
| **Korea** | $470B | Yes (memory leader) | Excellent |
| **Japan** | $13B+ | Attempting (Rapidus) | TBD |
| **EU** | €43B | Limited | Slow |
| **China** | $100B+ | Constrained | Blocked |
| **India** | $10B | No | Early |
| **Argentina** | Tax breaks | No (DC focus) | Early |

## Investment implications

**Winners from subsidy race:**
- Equipment makers ([[ASML]], [[Applied Materials]], [[Lam Research]]) — sell to all
- Construction/infrastructure — building everywhere
- Local suppliers in recipient regions

**Watch for:**
- Subsidy clawback provisions
- Guardrail enforcement (US-China)
- Execution delays (common in megaprojects)
- Overcapacity risk in mature nodes

---

## The meta-thesis

Subsidies don't create capability overnight:

| What subsidies can do | What they can't do |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Improve project IRRs | Create talent pools |
| Attract foreign fabs | Transfer tacit knowledge |
| Accelerate timelines | Overcome physics limits |
| Signal political will | Guarantee execution |

Korea and Taiwan built chip industries over decades. Subsidies help at the margin but don't substitute for ecosystem depth.
