#concept #banking #cronyism #comparison

**Ayandeh-Master comparison** — Two [[Bank cronyism]] collapses one month apart (Oct-Nov 2025). One authoritarian (Iran), one democratic (Brazil). Both linked to ~40-45 year old political structures. Same pattern, different outcomes.

---

## The collapses

| Dimension | [[Ayandeh Bank]] (Iran) | [[Banco Master]] (Brazil) |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Collapsed** | October 25, 2025 | November 17, 2025 |
| **Deposits trapped** | $2.34B | $7.6B (R$41B) |
| **Depositors** | 7 million | 1.6 million |
| **Owner** | [[Ali Ansari]] | Daniel Vorcaro |
| **Owner age at collapse** | 62 | 42 |

---

## The political structures

Both collapses linked to political systems ~40-45 years old — both with religious dimensions.

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **Founding moment** | Islamic Revolution (1979) | Nova República (1985) |
| **Age in 2025** | 46 years | 40 years |
| **Ruling network** | IRGC + revolutionary families + bonyads | Centrão (evolved from PMDB/MDB) |
| **Power broker** | Supreme Leader + IRGC | Congressional bloc brokers |
| **System type** | Authoritarian theocracy | Fragmented democracy |
| **Religious element** | Shia Islam (foundational) | Evangelical Christianity (rising) |

### The founders

| | Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini | Ulysses Guimarães |
|--|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Lived** | 1900-1989 | 1916-1992 |
| **Role** | Supreme Leader, founder of Islamic [[Republic]] | "Senhor Diretas," president of Constituent Assembly |
| **Vision** | Islamic government under clerical guardianship | Democratic republic, "Citizen Constitution" |
| **Key institution** | Velayat-e faqih (Guardian Jurist) | 1988 Constitution, PMDB |
| **Death** | June 3, 1989 (cancer, age 89) | October 12, 1992 (helicopter crash, body never found) |
| **Successor** | Ali Khamenei (required constitutional amendment) | No single successor; PMDB fragmented |

#### Khomeini — from revolutionary to system architect

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| **Opposition (1963-1964)** | Criticized Shah's reforms; imprisoned, then exiled |
| **Exile (1964-1979)** | Turkey → Iraq (Najaf, 14 years) → [[France]] (Neauphle-le-Château) |
| **Return (Feb 1, 1979)** | Chartered Air [[France]] 747; millions welcomed him in Tehran |
| **Consolidation (1979-1989)** | Established velayat-e faqih; created IRGC, bonyads, Guardian Council |

**What he built:**
- **Velayat-e faqih:** Supreme Leader has "absolute authority" over legislature, executive, judiciary (Article 57)
- **IRGC (May 1979):** Ideological counterweight to regular army; became economic conglomerate controlling 30-50% of economy
- **Bonyads:** Confiscated Pahlavi assets channeled to "charitable foundations" — became unaccountable economic actors (20-30% of non-oil GDP)
- **Guardian Council:** 12 members (6 appointed by Supreme Leader) vet all candidates and legislation

**The evolution he didn't foresee:** Bonyads + IRGC integrated into "military-bonyad complex" (50%+ of GDP by 2013 under Ahmadinejad). Revolutionary institutions became extraction vehicles.

#### Ulysses Guimarães — from resistance leader to constitution-maker

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| **Opposition (1964-1985)** | Led MDB (sole opposition party) against military rule |
| **Diretas Já (1983-1984)** | Mass campaign for direct elections; failed in Congress but delegitimized regime |
| **Transition (1985)** | Nearly became president; stepped aside for Tancredo Neves/Sarney ticket |
| **Constituent Assembly (1987-1988)** | Presided over drafting of "Citizen Constitution" |

**What he built:**
- **1988 Constitution:** [[Progressive]] social rights, universal healthcare (SUS), decentralized federation
- **PMDB:** Brazil's largest party — big tent, no fixed ideology, became vehicle for Centrão

**What emerged instead:**
- **Centrão (1987):** Center-right bloc formed *during* the Constituent Assembly to counter Ulysses's progressives; traded votes for positions/benefits
- Original members: PFL, PL, PDS, PDC, PTB + PMDB factions
- Secured Sarney's 5-year term through logrolling
- Became permanent feature: parties "without specific ideological orientation... proximity to executive to guarantee advantages"

**The irony:** Ulysses fought for democracy; the system he presided over birthed the Centrão. The same Constituent Assembly that produced the "Citizen Constitution" also normalized transactional politics.

#### Other founding fathers of the Nova República

| Figure | Role | Later trajectory |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Tancredo Neves** | President-elect (d. before inauguration) | Died April 21, 1985; coined "Nova República"; never took office |
| **José Sarney** | Vice president → President (1985-1990) | Former ARENA (regime party) leader; inflation 242% → 1,973%; joined PMDB opportunistically |
| **Franco Montoro** | Governor of São Paulo (1983-1987) | Hosted first Diretas Já rally (1.7M people); co-founded PSDB 1988 |
| **Leonel Brizola** | Governor of Rio de Janeiro (1983-1987) | Founded PDT; hosted 1M-person Rio rally; competed with Lula for left leadership |
| **Fernando Henrique Cardoso** | Senator, PMDB leader | Rapporteur of 1988 Constitution; co-founded PSDB; President 1995-2002 |
| **Mário Covas** | Congressman, São Paulo | PMDB progressive wing; co-founded PSDB; Governor of São Paulo 1995-2001 |
| **Teotônio Vilela** | Senator from Alagoas | "Menestrel das Alagoas"; fought for amnesty; died 1983 before seeing democracy |
| **Lula** | Union leader, PT founder | Led ABC strikes 1978-80; founded PT 1980; key Diretas Já leader; President 2003-2010, 2023- |

**The Diretas Já coalition (1983-1984):**

| Faction | Leaders | What they wanted |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **PMDB establishment** | Ulysses, Tancredo, Montoro | Direct elections, new constitution |
| **Labor left** | Lula, PT | Worker rights, social transformation |
| **Democratic left** | Brizola, PDT | Nationalism, "socialismo moreno" |
| **[[Progressive]] intellectuals** | FHC, Covas | Social democracy, modernization |

**April 25, 1984:** Diretas Já amendment failed (298 yes, 65 no, but 112 abstentions killed quorum). Despite loss, movement delegitimized regime.

**The split that followed:**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1985** | Tancredo elected by electoral college; dies; Sarney (ex-regime supporter) becomes president |
| **1987-1988** | Constituent Assembly — Centrão forms to counter progressives |
| **1988** | Progressives (FHC, Covas, Montoro, Serra) leave PMDB, found PSDB |
| **1989** | First direct election: Collor defeats Lula; PMDB's Ulysses gets 4.4% |

**The PMDB's transformation:**

| Phase | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| **1966-1979 (MDB)** | Sole legal opposition; united by anti-dictatorship stance |
| **1980-1985 (PMDB)** | Opposition coalition; big tent includes left and opportunists |
| **1985-1988** | Governing party; absorbs ex-regime figures; Centrão emerges |
| **1988-present (MDB)** | Transactional party; no ideology; whoever is president, MDB is there |

**The founders who left:** FHC, Covas, Montoro, Serra founded PSDB in June 1988 — 72 hours after constitution was promulgated — because PMDB "lost its focus on reform in a scramble for office and patronage."

**The founders who stayed:** Those who remained built what became the modern Centrão — the network Vorcaro would later plug into.

### From founders to bank cronies: the 40-year arc

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **Founder's vision** | Islamic social justice, resistance to West | Democratic citizenship, social rights |
| **Initial institution** | IRGC (protection), bonyads (redistribution) | Constitution (rights), PMDB (representation) |
| **40 years later** | IRGC-bonyad complex extracts via banking | Centrão extracts via state resources |
| **Corruption vehicle** | Ayandeh Bank → Iran Mall → Ansari | Banco Master → BRB → Vorcaro |
| **Protection mechanism** | Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son) | STF justices, Centrão leaders |

**The pattern:** Both founders created institutions to serve idealistic purposes. Over 40 years, those institutions were captured and repurposed for extraction. The founders are dead; their structures serve different masters.

### The ultimate beneficiaries: Khamenei and Lula

Neither founded their system. Both became its longest-lasting, most powerful figures.

| | Ali Khamenei | Lula |
|--|--------------|------|
| **Born** | 1939 (Mashhad) | 1945 (Pernambuco) |
| **Age at founding** | 40 (1979 revolution) | 40 (1985 Nova República) |
| **Role at founding** | Young cleric; Khomeini's confidant | Union leader; PT founder (1980) |
| **Path to power** | President 1981-89 → Supreme Leader 1989 | Lost 3 elections → President 2003 |
| **Years in power** | 36 years (1989-present) | 14 years (2003-10, 2023-present) |
| **Current age** | 85 | 79 |

#### Khamenei — the apprentice who outlasted everyone

| Phase | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **1962-1979** | Studied under Khomeini; imprisoned/tortured by SAVAK; revolutionary credentials |
| **1979** | Revolutionary Council; IRGC supervisor; Friday Prayer Imam |
| **1981-1989** | President (elected after assassination of predecessor); survived assassination attempt |
| **1989** | Khomeini dies; Khamenei selected as Supreme Leader (required constitutional amendment — wasn't qualified as marja) |
| **1989-present** | 36 years consolidating power; controls Setad ($95-200B); IRGC answers to him |

**What he controls:**
- **Setad:** $95-200B conglomerate (real estate, banks, telecoms, agriculture) — books hidden even from parliament
- **IRGC:** 30-50% of economy; all commanders appointed by him
- **Bonyads:** Nominally charitable; actually extraction vehicles
- **Judiciary, Guardian Council, Assembly of Experts:** All loyal

**Key insight:** Khamenei wasn't qualified to be Supreme Leader. Constitution had to be amended to remove the requirement that he be a marja (senior cleric). He was chosen because he was *controllable* — then spent 36 years proving he wasn't.

#### Lula — the outsider who learned to play the game

| Phase | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **1978-1980** | Led ABC strikes; founded PT with intellectuals, liberation theology Catholics, union militants |
| **1984** | Key leader of Diretas Já; outsider demanding system change |
| **1989, 1994, 1998** | Lost three presidential elections |
| **2002** | Finally won — "Letter to Brazilians" promising market-friendly policies |
| **2003-2010** | Two terms; commodity boom; Bolsa Família; left office with 83% approval |
| **2017-2021** | Imprisoned ([[Lava Jato]]); conviction annulled by STF |
| **2022-present** | Won narrowest election in history; governs WITH Centrão |

**What he controls:**
- **PT:** 5 presidential victories (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2022) — most successful party since redemocratization
- **Coalition:** Now includes PP, União Brasil — the very Centrão he once opposed
- **Narrative:** Still seen as champion of poor despite governing with oligarchs

**Key insight:** Lula didn't destroy the Centrão — he joined it. The PT now needs Arthur Lira and Ciro Nogueira (Vorcaro's "friends") to govern. The outsider became the system.

#### The parallel

| Dimension | Khamenei | Lula |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Founder relationship** | Khomeini's student/ally | Ulysses's coalition partner |
| **Initial position** | Junior cleric, not marja | Union leader, not politician |
| **Path to dominance** | Institutional capture (constitution changed for him) | Electoral persistence (4 tries to win) |
| **Longevity** | 36 years as Supreme Leader | 14 years as president (and counting) |
| **Wealth accumulation** | Setad ($95-200B) | Personal modest; PT machine enormous |
| **Current coalition** | IRGC + bonyads + clergy | PT + Centrão + business |
| **Relationship to cronies** | Mojtaba (son) linked to Ansari | Mantega introduced Vorcaro to Lula |

**The irony:** Both are "founders" in popular memory but weren't the primary architects.

- Khomeini founded the Islamic [[Republic]]; Khamenei inherited and expanded it
- Ulysses/Tancredo founded the Nova República; Lula learned to dominate it

**The deeper irony:** Both now preside over systems that enable the very extraction they once opposed.

- Khamenei's revolutionary rhetoric vs. IRGC-bonyad oligarchy
- Lula's worker solidarity rhetoric vs. governing with Centrão and Vorcaro's "friends"

**Neither built the house. Both moved in and remodeled it.**

### The religious dimension

| | Iran (Islam) | Brazil (Evangelicals) |
|--|--------------|----------------------|
| **Role in founding** | Central — Islamic Revolution | Minor — grew within democracy |
| **Current political weight** | Legitimizes entire system | Bancada evangélica — major Centrão bloc |
| **Institutional form** | Velayat-e faqih (clerical rule) | Evangelical caucus, mega-church networks |
| **Economic footprint** | Bonyads (religious foundations) | Church-linked businesses, media |
| **Moral cover** | Revolution = Islamic purity | "Family values," anti-corruption rhetoric |
| **Cronyism relationship** | Clerics + IRGC extract together | Evangelical politicians in Centrão deals |

**The function:** Religion provides moral legitimacy that obscures extraction.

| System | Rhetoric | Reality |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Iran** | "Islamic economy," resistance to West | IRGC oligarchs, bonyad capture |
| **Brazil** | "God, family, country," anti-PT corruption | Orçamento secreto, Banco Master |

**Key parallel:** Both use religious framing to justify political power while enabling crony extraction behind the scenes.

- Iran: Revolutionary purity → IRGC business empire
- Brazil: Evangelical morality → Centrão deal-making

**Ansari connection:** Proximity to Supreme Leader's son = religious-political nexus
**Vorcaro connection:** Brasília network includes evangelical-aligned politicians

**Why ~40 years matters:**

| Stage | What develops |
|-------|---------------|
| **Years 1-10** | Founding elite consolidates |
| **Years 10-20** | Second generation enters; networks formalize |
| **Years 20-30** | Extraction mechanisms normalize |
| **Years 30-40** | Outsiders learn to plug in; system teaches what's possible |
| **Years 40+** | Mature capture; scandals expose but don't reform |

Both Ansari and Vorcaro weren't founders — they learned how to access established networks. The structures taught them.

### When the regimes congealed

Both systems had a **reform window** that closed, after which the power structure became fixed.

#### Brazil: Congealed after FHC (2002)

| Phase | Period | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Founding chaos** | 1985-1994 | Sarney inflation, Collor impeachment, instability |
| **Reform window** | 1995-2002 | FHC: Real Plan, privatizations, Fiscal Responsibility Law, institutional modernization |
| **Congealing** | 2003-2016 | PT + Centrão modus vivendi; Mensalão/Petrolão show capture is bipartisan |
| **Brief reform attempt** | 2016-2018 | Temer: labor reform, spending cap (teto de gastos), pension reform (failed) |
| **Restoration** | 2019-present | Bolsonaro governed with Centrão; Lula governs with Centrão; system permanent |

**FHC's reforms:**
- Real Plan ended hyperinflation
- Privatized telecoms, mining, banking
- Fiscal Responsibility Law constrained states
- Created regulatory agencies (ANATEL, ANEEL, ANP)

**What he couldn't reform:** The Centrão, the STF's political role, the coalition-presidency dependence. He *needed* the Centrão to govern — same as everyone after.

**Temer's brief window (2016-2018):**
- Labor reform (flexibilization)
- Spending cap constitutional amendment
- Attempted pension reform (blocked)

**Why it failed:** Temer was illegitimate (2% approval), couldn't build coalition for structural change. Reforms that passed were technical; political structure untouched.

**Post-Temer:** Bolsonaro ran as outsider, governed with Centrão. Lula ran against Centrão, governs with Centrão. The system absorbed both.

#### Iran: Congealed after 2009 Green Movement

| Phase | Period | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Revolutionary consolidation** | 1979-1989 | Khomeini; war with Iraq; institutions created |
| **Reconstruction** | 1989-1997 | Rafsanjani: technocratic, privatization attempts, pragmatic |
| **Reform window** | 1997-2005 | Khatami: civil society, press freedom, "dialogue of civilizations" |
| **Congealing** | 2005-2009 | Ahmadinejad: IRGC economic expansion; Guardian Council tightens vetting |
| **Closure** | 2009 | Green Movement crushed; Mousavi/Karroubi under house arrest (still) |
| **Brief opening attempt** | 2013-2018 | Rouhani: JCPOA nuclear deal; domestic reform blocked |
| **Restoration** | 2018-present | Trump exits JCPOA; Raisi hardliner era; system fully captured |

**Khatami's reforms (attempted):**
- Press freedom expansion (dozens of new publications)
- Civil society organizations
- "Dialogue of civilizations" (international rehabilitation)
- Local council elections

**What blocked him:** Guardian Council vetoed legislation; IRGC/judiciary closed newspapers; couldn't protect supporters. 1999 student protests showed limits — Khatami called for calm, not change.

**2009 — the closure:**
- Mousavi/Karroubi challenged election results
- Millions protested ("Where is my vote?")
- Regime crushed movement; leaders under house arrest since
- Message: Reform within system is impossible

**Rouhani's brief window (2013-2021):**
- JCPOA nuclear deal (2015) — major achievement
- Attempted economic opening
- Domestic reform blocked by IRGC, judiciary, Guardian Council

**Why it failed:** JCPOA was *external* diplomacy; Rouhani had no leverage over *internal* power centers. IRGC expanded economically throughout his presidency. When Trump exited JCPOA (2018), Rouhani had nothing.

#### The parallel

| Dimension | Brazil | Iran |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Reform window** | FHC (1995-2002) | Khatami (1997-2005) |
| **What was achieved** | Economic stabilization, institutions | Civil society, international image |
| **What couldn't be reformed** | Centrão, coalition politics | IRGC, Guardian Council, clerical power |
| **Closure event** | PT-Centrão accommodation (2003+) | Green Movement crushed (2009) |
| **Brief reopening** | Temer (2016-2018) | Rouhani (2013-2018) |
| **Reopening achieved** | Technical reforms (labor, spending cap) | JCPOA (external) |
| **Why it failed** | No legitimacy, no coalition | No internal leverage, external shock (Trump) |
| **Current state** | All factions govern with Centrão | All factions serve IRGC-clerical complex |

**The pattern:**
1. Reform window opens (FHC/Khatami)
2. Structural constraints block deep change
3. Window closes (PT accommodation/Green Movement)
4. Brief technical reopening (Temer/Rouhani)
5. External or internal shock ends reopening
6. System congeals permanently

**Key insight:** Both regimes had a ~10-year reform window (mid-1990s to mid-2000s) when change seemed possible. Both windows closed. Both had brief technical reopenings that failed. Both are now structurally fixed.

**The congealed state:**
- **Brazil:** Any president needs Centrão; STF is political actor; extraction is bipartisan
- **Iran:** Any president is subordinate to Leader/IRGC; Guardian Council controls entry; extraction is factional but universal

### The professional classes that run the regimes

Both systems are sustained by professional strata whose privileges depend on the regime's continuation.

#### Brazil's ruling classes

| Class | Role | Privileges | Reform resistance |
|-------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Burocratas** | Federal/state civil servants | Estabilidade (job security), high salaries, pension privileges | [[Block]] administrative reform |
| **Juízes/bacharéis** | Judges, prosecutors, legal professionals | World's highest judicial salaries, auxílios (allowances), corporatist protections | [[Block]] judicial reform, protect own |
| **Empresários protegidos** | Industrialists in closed sectors | Import protection, "custo Brasil" as barrier to entry, government contracts | [[Block]] trade opening |
| **Políticos regionais** | Governors, mayors, dynasties | Federal transfers (FPE/FPM), local patronage, family succession | [[Block]] federalism reform |
| **Banqueiros** | Bank oligopoly (5 banks = 80%) | Highest spreads globally, regulatory capture | [[Block]] financial competition |

**The bacharel class:**

Brazil's legal-judicial complex is distinctive. The *bacharel* (law graduate) has been the entry ticket to elite status since the Empire.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Origins** | Imperial Brazil had two law schools (São Paulo, Recife); degree = elite membership |
| **Modern form** | STF justices, desembargadores, prosecutors (MP), public defenders |
| **Salaries** | STF justice: R$44K/month base + auxílios → R$60K+ effective (~$12K/month) |
| **Auxílios** | Moradia (housing), alimentação (food), livro (books), saúde (health) — often exceed base salary |
| **Job security** | Lifetime appointment, nearly impossible to remove |
| **Corporatism** | Judges judge judges; prosecutors prosecute prosecutors; self-regulation |

**[[Lava Jato]] as class conflict within the bacharéis:**

| Group | Position | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Prosecutors (MPF)** | Attacked political class | Dallagnol barred, task force dismantled |
| **Lower court judges** | Moro convicted politicians | Moro declared biased, career destroyed |
| **STF justices** | Protected political class | Prevailed; voided convictions; now handle Vorcaro |

**The lesson:** When one segment of the bacharel class threatened the system, the senior segment (STF) destroyed them. Class solidarity > anti-corruption.

**The protected industrialists:**

| Sector | Protection mechanism | Beneficiaries |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Autos** | High tariffs, local content rules | VW, Fiat, [[GM]] Brazil operations |
| **Electronics (Zona Franca)** | Manaus tax haven | [[Samsung]], LG assembly |
| **Construction** | Government contracts, BNDES financing | Odebrecht, Camargo Corrêa, OAS (pre-[[Lava Jato]]) |
| **Banking** | Oligopoly tolerance, regulation barriers | Itaú, [[Bradesco]], BB, Santander, Caixa |

**Regional political dynasties (coronelismo moderno):**

| State | Dynasty | Duration |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Maranhão | Sarney family | 1965-present (60 years) |
| Bahia | ACM → ACM Neto | 1970s-present |
| Alagoas | Collor, Calheiros families | Decades |
| Ceará | Ferreira Gomes, Cid Gomes | 2000s-present |
| Minas Gerais | Rotating oligarchy (Aécio, Itamar, Anastasia) | Continuous |

These families control state machines, federal deputy delegations, Senate seats. The Centrão *is* these families at federal level.

#### Iran's ruling classes

| Class | Role | Privileges | Reform resistance |
|-------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Clerics (روحانیون)** | Religious legitimation, judiciary, Guardian Council | Stipends, bonyad positions, social prestige, immunity | [[Block]] secularization |
| **IRGC (سپاه)** | Military, intelligence, economic empire | 30-50% of economy, import monopolies, contract preference | [[Block]] economic opening |
| **Basij (بسیج)** | Social base, street control, surveillance | University preference, job preference, loans, housing | Provide foot soldiers |
| **Bonyad managers** | Run "charitable" foundations | No accountability, patronage control | [[Block]] transparency |
| **Technocrats** | Run ministries, Central Bank | Tolerated expertise | Serve whoever is in power |

**The clerical class:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Training** | Qom seminaries (hawza); 10-15 years to reach mujtahid level |
| **Ranks** | Hojatoleslam → Ayatollah → Grand Ayatollah (marja) |
| **Income** | Khums (20% religious tax), government stipends, bonyad salaries |
| **Positions** | Guardian Council (6/12), judiciary head, Friday prayer imams, Assembly of Experts |
| **Immunity** | Special clerical court; clerics judge clerics |

**Not monolithic:** Reformist clerics exist (Montazeri, Kadivar, Soroush) — but expelled or marginalized. The *ruling* clerical class is self-selected for regime loyalty.

**The IRGC economic empire:**

| Entity | Sector | Scale |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Khatam al-Anbiya** | Construction, engineering | Iran's largest contractor; dams, pipelines, metros |
| **IRGC Cooperative Foundation** | Diversified | [[Housing]], manufacturing, imports |
| **Telecommunications** | Mobile, internet | Controls infrastructure |
| **Sanctions evasion** | [[Trade]], shipping, banking | Entire parallel economy |
| **Smuggling** | Imports via unregulated ports | $12-20B annually (estimates) |

**IRGC as class:**
- ~125,000 active personnel + veterans network
- Second generation now in power (children of 1979 Guards)
- Intermarriage with clerical families
- Business partnerships with bonyads
- Educational institutions (Imam Hossein University)

**The Basij — Iran's foot soldiers:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Size** | 1-5 million (claims vary); active core ~90,000 |
| **Recruitment** | Lower-middle class, provincial, religious families |
| **Benefits** | University admission (40% quota), government job preference, loans, housing |
| **Function** | Neighborhood surveillance, protest suppression, election mobilization |
| **Deployed** | 2009 Green Movement, 2019 fuel protests, 2022 Mahsa Amini protests |

**The Basij bargain:** Regime provides upward mobility for provincial lower-middle class; in exchange, Basij provides social control. It's a *class* deal: urban educated professionals vs. provincial religious conservatives.

#### The structural parallel

| Function | Brazil | Iran |
|----------|--------|------|
| **Ideological legitimation** | Bacharéis (legal formalism, Constitution) | Clerics (religious authority, velayat-e faqih) |
| **Coercive capacity** | Military police, Federal Police | IRGC, Basij |
| **Economic gatekeeping** | Protected industrialists, bank oligopoly | IRGC companies, bonyads |
| **Territorial control** | Regional dynasties (coronéis) | Provincial IRGC, Friday prayer imams |
| **Social base** | Public sector unions, Bolsa Família recipients | Basij volunteers, mostazafin (dispossessed) |
| **Technical operation** | Federal bureaucracy | Ministry technocrats |

**Key parallel — corporatist self-protection:**

| | Brazil | Iran |
|--|--------|------|
| **Judges judging judges** | STF protects judiciary privileges | Clerical courts judge clerics |
| **Class closing ranks** | STF destroyed [[Lava Jato]] prosecutors | Guardian Council excludes reformist clerics |
| **Threat response** | Moro/Dallagnol expelled from class | Montazeri (Khomeini's heir) expelled, died under house arrest |

**Who benefits from closure:**

| Brazil (closed economy) | Iran (closed economy) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Industrialists (tariff protection) | IRGC (import monopolies) |
| [[Banks]] (oligopoly spreads) | Bonyads (no competition) |
| Bureaucrats (no private sector benchmark) | Clerics (no secular alternative) |
| Construction firms (government contracts) | Khatam al-Anbiya (all major projects) |

**Both regimes are coalitions of:**
1. An ideological legitimation class (bacharéis / clerics)
2. A coercive apparatus (police / IRGC-Basij)
3. Economic beneficiaries of closure (protected capital / IRGC-bonyads)
4. Territorial bosses (coronéis / provincial commanders)
5. A mass base bought with transfers (Bolsa Família / Basij benefits)
6. **Political dynasties that do not rotate**

#### Political dynasties — the families that don't rotate

**Brazil — the same families since redemocratization (or before):**

| Family/Group | Base | Duration | Current position |
|--------------|------|----------|------------------|
| **Sarney** | Maranhão | 1965-present (60 years) | José Sarney (ex-president), Roseana (ex-governor), family controls state |
| **Collor** | Alagoas | 1970s-present | Fernando Collor (ex-president, senator until 2023 conviction) |
| **Calheiros** | Alagoas | 1980s-present | Renan Calheiros (Senate president multiple times), son Renan Filho (senator) |
| **Barbalho** | Pará | 1980s-present | Jader Barbalho (senator), Helder Barbalho (governor) |
| **Magalhães (ACM)** | Bahia | 1970s-present | ACM (d. 2007), ACM Neto (ex-mayor Salvador, now União Brasil president) |
| **Ferreira Gomes** | Ceará | 2000s-present | Ciro Gomes (3x presidential candidate), Cid Gomes (senator, ex-governor) |
| **Covas-Doria** | São Paulo | 1980s-present | Mário Covas (d. 2001), Bruno Covas (d. 2021), João Doria (ex-governor) |
| **Lula-PT** | National | 1980-present | PT won 5 of 8 presidential elections since 2002; Lula personally 4 terms |
| **Bolsonaro** | National/Rio | 1990s-present | Jair + 4 sons in politics (federal deputy, senator, councilman) |

**The Centrão isn't an ideology — it's a cartel of families:**

| Party | Families/Bosses |
|-------|-----------------|
| **PP** | Ciro Nogueira (Piauí dynasty), Arthur Lira (Alagoas) |
| **União Brasil** | ACM Neto, Rueda; merger of DEM (ex-PFL) + PSL |
| **MDB** | Sarney, Barbalho, Calheiros, Temer network |
| **PSD** | Gilberto Kassab network; Ratinho Jr (Paraná) |
| **Republicanos** | Universal Church (Edir Macedo) political arm |

**Iran — revolutionary families + clerical dynasties:**

| Family/Group | Base | Duration | Current position |
|--------------|------|----------|------------------|
| **Khamenei** | Supreme Leader's office | 1989-present (36 years) | Ali (Supreme Leader), Mojtaba (heir apparent), controls Setad |
| **Rafsanjani** | Expediency Council, business | 1979-2017 (d.) | Hashemi Rafsanjani network still active; children wealthy |
| **Larijani** | Multiple branches | 1980s-present | 5 brothers: Ali (parliament speaker), Sadegh (judiciary head), etc. |
| **Khomeini** | Revolutionary legitimacy | 1979-present | Hassan Khomeini (grandson, reformist voice); family prestige |
| **Khatami** | Reformist wing | 1990s-present | Mohammad (ex-president), family network in Yazd |
| **Ahmadinejad** | Populist/IRGC wing | 2005-present | Mahmoud (ex-president), network of proteges; now marginalized |
| **Jannati** | Guardian Council | 1980s-present | Ahmad Jannati (GC head since 1990s, now 97 years old) |

**IRGC as dynasties:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Second generation** | Children of 1979 Guards now in command positions |
| **Intermarriage** | IRGC families marry clerical families; economic-political fusion |
| **Business inheritance** | IRGC-linked companies pass through family networks |
| **Examples** | Soleimani's family (prestige); Jafari, Salami family networks |

**Clerical dynasties:**

| Family | Positions held |
|--------|---------------|
| **Shahroudi** | Mahmoud (d. 2018): judiciary head, Expediency Council |
| **Yazdi** | Mohammad (d. 2020): judiciary head, Guardian Council |
| **Amoli** | Abdullah Javadi-Amoli: senior marja, disciples in government |
| **Makarem** | Naser Makarem-Shirazi: senior marja, fatwas shape policy |

**The parallel:**

| Dimension | Brazil | Iran |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Regime age** | 40 years | 46 years |
| **Family persistence** | 60+ years (Sarney predates Nova República) | 46 years (revolutionary families) |
| **Intermarriage** | Political families marry business families | IRGC marries clerical families |
| **Geographic bases** | Each family controls a state | Each network controls institutions |
| **Party labels** | Families switch parties; parties are vehicles | Factions are vehicles; families persist |
| **Nominal opposition** | PT vs Centrão (but Lula governs with Centrão) | Reformist vs Principlist (but all serve Leader) |

**Nothing rotates:**

| Class | Brazil | Iran |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Political families** | Same since 1985 (or earlier) | Same since 1979 |
| **Judicial elite** | STF justices stay 20+ years | Judiciary heads appointed for life |
| **Economic elite** | Same conglomerates (banks, industry) | Same IRGC-bonyad networks |
| **Regional bosses** | Sarney in MA, ACM in BA, etc. | Friday imams, provincial IRGC |

**The regime IS these families.** Elections determine which family coalition is ascendant, not whether the families rule.

**Ansari and Vorcaro weren't outsiders crashing the party — they were learning to marry into it.** Both built relationships with regime families:
- Ansari → Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son)
- Vorcaro → Centrão bosses (Lira, Ciro Nogueira) + STF justices

**The professional classes AND the political families are permanent.** Only the specific coalition configuration shifts.

## The owners

**Business entrepreneurs turned cronyism entrepreneurs.**

| | Ali Ansari | Daniel Vorcaro |
|--|------------|----------------|
| **Background** | Construction, metals trading | Finance, real estate |
| **Legitimate phase** | Built Iran's largest metals trading hub (1994) | Built portfolio across finance, healthcare, retail |
| **Entry to banking** | Founded Tat Bank (2009) | Acquired Banco Máxima (2017) |
| **Political connection** | Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son) | Brasília network, STF justices |
| **Extraction vehicle** | [[Shell]] companies, self-dealing loans | High-yield CDBs, state bank injection |
| **Personal project** | Iran Mall ($687M "loan") | Under investigation |
| **Escape attempt** | Stayed in Iran (protected) | Arrested fleeing to Malta |

### The transition: business → cronyism

Both followed the same arc:

```
1. Build legitimate business (metals, real estate, finance)
       ↓
2. Accumulate capital and reputation
       ↓
3. Discover political access is available
       ↓
4. Obtain banking license (the leverage machine)
       ↓
5. Learn extraction is tolerated/protected
       ↓
6. Scale extraction until collapse
```

**Key insight:** They weren't born cronies. They were *taught* by the system.

| Phase | What they learned |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Legitimate success** | How the economy works |
| **First political contact** | Access is purchasable |
| **Banking entry** | Deposits = free capital |
| **First self-dealing** | Enforcement is weak |
| **Scaling up** | Protection is available |
| **Near collapse** | State will intervene |

**The system's role:** Mature political structures (40+ years) don't just tolerate extraction — they *demonstrate* it. Ansari and Vorcaro saw others succeed and learned the playbook.

**Profile similarity:** Outsiders who learned to plug into mature political networks. Not regime founders — regime users. Not ideologues — opportunists.

---

## The mechanisms

| | Ayandeh | Master |
|--|---------|--------|
| **Deposit attraction** | High rates promised | High-yield CDBs (140%+ CDI) via apps |
| **Where deposits went** | Self-dealing loans to ~100 shell companies | Under investigation |
| **Asset type** | Illiquid real estate (Iran Mall) | Allegedly fraudulent credit securities |
| **Ponzi element** | New deposits paid old; needed CBI borrowing | Aggressive growth, unsustainable rates |
| **State bank role** | CBI printed money to keep liquid | BRB injected R$16.7B |

**Same core pattern:**
```
Attract deposits with above-market rates
    → Channel to self/connected parties
        → Illiquid or fraudulent assets
            → Liquidity crisis
                → State/industry absorbs losses
```

---

## The political protection

| | Ayandeh | Master |
|--|---------|--------|
| **Key connection** | Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son) | STF justices, Brasília network |
| **Regulatory forbearance** | CBI kept lending despite insolvency | BRB kept injecting despite red flags |
| **Criminal charges** | Filed 2022, escaped prosecution | Filed 2025, arrested |
| **Judicial involvement** | Regime courts — no independence | STF justices entangled (Toffoli, Moraes) |

---

## Key individuals linked to each bank

### Iran — Ayandeh Bank

#### The inner circle

| Individual | Role | Connection to Ansari |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| **Mojtaba Khamenei** | Supreme Leader's son, heir apparent | "Well-documented proximity"; Ansari's companies allegedly fronts for Mojtaba's network |
| **Ali Khamenei** | Supreme Leader | Implicit protection via son; Mohsen Rezaei's letters copied to Leader's office |
| **Mahmoud Ahmadinejad** | Former President (2005-2013) | Ansari sponsored his 2009 campaign with 1.2B toman via Mehrdad Bazrpash |
| **Vahid Haqqanian** | Leader's office representative | Attended Ali-Akbar Ansari's funeral (May 2025) |
| **Mahmoud Alavi** | Former Intelligence Minister | Attended funeral — security apparatus presence |
| **Seyed Ali Khomeini** | Khomeini family member | Attended funeral — revolutionary dynasty connection |

#### Who knew and when

| Individual | Position | Knowledge/Action |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Ebrahim Raisi** | President (d. 2024) | Received "Top Secret — Very Urgent" letter Nov 2023; under Raisi, CBI injected another 2,000 trillion rials (~$1.9B) into Ayandeh |
| **Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf** | Parliament Speaker (ex-IRGC) | Received urgent briefings since Dec 2022; later called dissolution "great success" |
| **Masoud Pezeshkian** | Current President | Credited with "approvals" facilitating dissolution |
| **Mohammad-Reza Farzin** | Central Bank Governor | Announced dissolution; received correspondence detailing crisis |
| **Mohsen Rezaei** | Secretary, Supreme Council of Economic Coordination | Sent "Top Secret — Very Urgent" letters to Raisi, Ghalibaf, Eje'i (Nov 2023) |
| **Mohammad Jafar Montazeri** | Attorney General | Issued urgent warnings about banking imbalances (June 2023) |

**Key document:** Mohsen Rezaei's Nov 2023 letter to Raisi/Ghalibaf/Eje'i detailed Ayandeh's 90-trillion-toman accumulated loss. Dissolution came 2 years later.

#### Iran Mall board / protection network

| Individual | Role | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| **Ali-Akbar Ansari** | Ali Ansari's father | Died May-June 2025; funeral revealed network |
| **Ala Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi** | Islamic Coalition founder, Iran Mall board | Died late 2025 — removal of protective figure |
| **Jalal Rasoulaf** | Banker, Iran Mall board trustee | Connected to financial establishment |

**The shield cracked:** Two protective figures died in 2025 (Ali-Akbar Ansari, Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi). Only then could media question why Ayandeh wasn't dissolved earlier.

#### Ansari's method: "Insured by Imam Hossein"

**Give every faction a share so no faction demands investigation.**

| Faction | Who got shares | Method |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Leader's office** | Mojtaba Khamenei | Direct proximity, alleged fronts |
| **IRGC** | Military-economic elite | [[UK]] sanctions cite IRGC funding |
| **Conservatives** | Islamic Coalition | Mir-Mohammad-Sadeghi on board |
| **Ahmadinejad network** | Campaign support | 1.2B toman via Bazrpash |
| **Religious establishment** | Shrine donations, mosques | Carpets to shrines in Iran/Iraq |

#### Why Ansari wasn't prosecuted

Others with large bank debts were arrested, tried, or executed:

| Name | Crime | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Babak Zanjani** | Sanctions evasion, oil sales | Sentenced to death |
| **Mah-Afarid Khosravi** | Banking fraud | Executed |
| **Hossein Hedayati** | Financial crimes | Prosecuted |
| **Mohammadreza Zonouzi** | Banking fraud | Prosecuted |
| **Ali Ansari** | $5B+ self-dealing | **Protected** |

**Why the difference?** Zanjani's "service to the system" was sanctions evasion — useful but expendable. Ansari's method was different: religious donations (shrines, mosques, charities) + cross-factional loans. No single faction wanted investigation because all had received shares.

**Result:** Cross-factional complicity. The system that should investigate is the system that benefited.

### Brazil — Banco Master

#### The "trinca" (trio) — Centrão brokers

| Individual | Position | Role |
|------------|----------|------|
| **Ciro Nogueira** | PP president, ex-Bolsonaro Chief of Staff | Key broker — brought Vorcaro into Federal District government; proposed "Master amendment" to raise FGC limit |
| **Antonio Rueda** | União Brasil president | Helped negotiate BRB deal |
| **Arthur Lira** | Former Chamber President (PP) | Considered one of Vorcaro's closest "friends" in politics |

Journalist Luís Costa Pinto: "Os maiores amigos dele na política são Ciro Nogueira, Antonio Rueda e Arthur Lira."

This trio brought Vorcaro to Governor Ibaneis Rocha to orchestrate the BRB acquisition.

#### Supreme Court justices

| Justice | Involvement | Detail |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Alexandre de Moraes** | Wife's contract, calls to CB | R$129M contract with wife's firm; contacted CB president Galípolo 6+ times (5 in one day) |
| **Dias Toffoli** | Case rapporteur, travel | Became rapporteur 11 days after Vorcaro's arrest; flew to Libertadores final (Lima) on private jet with Vorcaro's defense lawyer |
| **Gilmar Mendes** | Pending Master case | Bank has appeal on tax matter (CSLL) in his office |
| **Luiz Fux** | Event attendance | Attended Brazil Conference at Cambridge (Master was [[Platinum]] sponsor) |

**Sponsored events (2022-2025):** Banco Master sponsored forums in New York, London, Paris, Rome, and Cambridge (USA) attended by four sitting STF justices (Toffoli, Mendes, Moraes, Fux) plus former justices Barroso and Lewandowski (now Justice Minister).

**2022 Fasano dinner:** Vorcaro and Banco Master paid for dinner for Gilmar Mendes, Moraes, Barroso, and Lewandowski at Fasano New York (5th Avenue).

#### Executive branch

| Individual | Position | Connection |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Ibaneis Rocha** | Federal District Governor (MDB) | Signed law authorizing BRB acquisition (Aug 2025); claims met Vorcaro only "once or twice socially" |
| **Michel Temer** | Former President (MDB) | Hired as mediator after CB blocked deal |
| **Guido Mantega** | Former Finance Minister (PT) | Consultant; introduced Vorcaro personally to President Lula |
| **Ricardo Lewandowski** | Justice Minister (former STF) | Attended Vorcaro-sponsored events |
| **Jorge Messias** | Advocate General of the Union (nominated to STF) | Attended Vorcaro-sponsored events |

**Ibaneis testimony:** Ex-BRB president Paulo Henrique Costa testified that he informed Governor Ibaneis Rocha about the R$12.2B operation. Ibaneis attributed the crisis to "excess of confidence."

#### Central Bank / regulators

| Individual | Position | Role |
|------------|----------|------|
| **Roberto Campos Neto** | CB President (until Dec 2024) | Called Vorcaro to emergency meeting Dec 2024, demanded capital injection |
| **Gabriel Galípolo** | CB President (from Jan 2025) | Contacted by Justice Moraes 6+ times during investigation |
| **Henrique Meirelles** | Former CB President | On Banco Master advisory committee |
| **Paulo Henrique Costa** | BRB President | Oversaw R$16.7B injection; removed; testified Ibaneis knew |
| **Juliana Monici Souza Pinheiro** | Ibaneis's Chief of Staff | Became CVM defendant in BRB-Master case |

#### Business partners / hidden network

| Individual | Role | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| **Nelson Tanure** | Investor (distressed companies) | Federal Police identified as "hidden partner" (sócio oculto) of Master; denies any ownership |
| **Conte brothers** | Original partners | Partnered with Vorcaro to acquire Banco Máxima (2018-2019) |
| **[[Saul Sabbá]]** | Previous owner | Sold Banco Máxima to Vorcaro; had been restricted from banking by CB |

**Tanure allegations:** CVM report found "coordinated" and "interdependent" action between Tanure and Master to inflate Ambipar share price (+700%). Tanure used MAM Asset (Vorcaro's fund manager) for acquisitions including Copel [[Telecom]] (R$2.5B) and EMAE.

#### Pension fund exposure (not FGC-covered)

| Fund | Exposure | Political connection |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Rioprevidência** (Rio state) | R$970M - R$2.6B | — |
| **Amprev** (Amapá state) | R$400M | Linked to Senator Davi Alcolumbre (União Brasil) |
| **Maceió Previdência** | R$97M | Mayor Paulo Henrique tied to Arthur Lira |
| Multiple municipal funds | R$1.9B total | — |

These are Financial Letters (letras financeiras), not CDBs — no FGC protection. States/municipalities must cover any shortfall.

#### Vorcaro's method: Cross-party, cross-institutional coverage

| Branch/Party | Individuals |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Executive (PT)** | Mantega → Lula introduction |
| **Executive (MDB)** | Temer as mediator, Ibaneis as governor |
| **Executive (PSD)** | Kassab ties to Centrão |
| **Legislature (Centrão)** | Ciro Nogueira (PP), Rueda (União), Lira (PP) |
| **Judiciary (STF)** | Moraes (contract), Toffoli (travel/rapporteur), Mendes, Fux (events) |
| **Central Bank (former)** | Meirelles on advisory board |
| **Prosecutors** | Paulo Gonet (AG) attended events |

**Result:** Like Ansari, Vorcaro distributed access across factions. All three branches, all major parties, regulators, prosecutors — all touched.

#### The "Master amendment"

Senator Ciro Nogueira proposed amendment to CB autonomy PEC that would raise FGC coverage from R$250K to R$1M for CDBs — Master's main product. Called "emenda Master" in Brasília. Not adopted.

### The Moraes-Mojtaba parallel

| | Iran (Ansari) | Brazil (Vorcaro) |
|--|---------------|------------------|
| **Key regime figure** | Mojtaba Khamenei | Alexandre de Moraes |
| **Relationship** | Supreme Leader's son | STF justice |
| **Family connection** | Direct proximity | Wife's R$129M contract |
| **Alleged benefit** | Front companies for Mojtaba's network | Legal fees to family firm |
| **Conflict** | Son of ultimate authority | Justice contacted regulator investigating client |
| **Religious dimension** | Mojtaba = future Supreme Leader (Shia clerical) | Moraes seen as moral authority vs Bolsonarismo |

Both connected their banks to individuals who embody moral/religious authority in their systems — the Supreme Leader's heir in Iran, the "defender of democracy" justice in Brazil.

## The resolution

| | Ayandeh | Master |
|--|---------|--------|
| **Resolution type** | Merged into Bank Melli (state) | Liquidated |
| **Who pays** | Depositors via inflation | FGC (bank-funded, R$41B) |
| **Owner outcome** | [[UK]]-sanctioned, protected in Iran | Arrested, ankle monitor |
| **Accountability** | None domestically | Pending — STF entanglement may derail |

### Loss socialization

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | CBI prints rials → inflation | FGC payout |
| **Who bears cost** | All rial holders (purchasing power) | Bank industry (FGC contributions) |
| **Visibility** | Hidden (inflation) | Visible (R$41B payout) |
| **Political salience** | Contributed to Dec 2025 rial crisis | IMF/World Bank concerns |

---

## The outcomes

| Dimension | Iran (authoritarian) | Brazil (democratic) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Exposure** | Collapse forced recognition | CB investigation exposed |
| **Accountability** | Owner protected | Owner arrested (for now) |
| **Institutional damage** | Already captured — no change | Supreme Court credibility damaged |
| **International response** | [[UK]] sanctions on Ansari | IMF/World Bank concerns |
| **Reform prospect** | None — system is the problem | CPI possible, external pressure |
| **Depositor recovery** | Lost via inflation | FGC covers up to R$250K |

---

## Key insights

### 1. Same pattern, different systems

Both cases show identical [[Bank cronyism]] mechanics:
- Politically connected outsider obtains/grows bank
- Attracts deposits with above-market rates
- Channels funds to self/connected parties
- State resources (central bank, state bank) prop up until collapse
- Losses socialized

The pattern doesn't require authoritarianism — it requires mature political networks and captured institutions.

### 2. Democratic advantage is conditional

Brazil's institutions eventually acted:
- Central Bank blocked BRB acquisition
- Central Bank liquidated Master
- Federal Police arrested Vorcaro

But Supreme Court entanglement (Toffoli, Moraes) may undermine accountability. Democracy provides *possibility* of accountability, not guarantee.

### 3. 40-year maturation period

Both political structures had ~4 decades to:
- Develop second/third generation networks
- Normalize extraction mechanisms
- Teach outsiders how to plug in

**Implication:** Watch other ~40-year-old political structures for similar patterns.

| Structure | Founded | Age (2025) | Watch for |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| [[China]] (Deng era) | 1978 | 47 years | "Princelings" extraction |
| Turkey (AKP) | 2002 | 23 years | Maturing, not yet peak |
| [[Russia]] (Putin) | 2000 | 25 years | Maturing |
| [[Venezuela]] (Chavismo) | 1999 | 26 years | Already collapsed |

### 4. External pressure matters differently

| | Iran | Brazil |
|--|------|--------|
| **External pressure** | [[UK]] sanctions (limited impact) | IMF/World Bank/market access |
| **Regime sensitivity** | Low — already isolated | High — needs investment grade |
| **Accountability driver** | None | Reputational cost |

Brazil's integration into global financial system creates accountability pressure Iran doesn't face.

## Corruption scandal parallels: Mensalão/Petrolão vs Iranian cases

Brazil's Nova República produced two landmark corruption scandals before Banco Master. Iran's Islamic [[Republic]] produced parallel cases — but with different outcomes.

### Brazil's defining scandals

| Scandal | Period | Mechanism | Scale | Outcome |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Mensalão** | 2005-2012 | PT paid legislators monthly bribes (mensalão = "big monthly payment") for votes | R$141M distributed | 25 convictions including PT treasurer, chief of staff; Lula not charged |
| **Petrolão / [[Lava Jato]]** | 2014-2021 | Systematic kickbacks at [[Petrobras]]: contractors overbilled, skimmed to politicians | R$6.4B+ identified | 174 convictions; Lula imprisoned (later annulled); Odebrecht plea deals |

**The pattern:** State resources → inflated contracts → kickbacks → political parties → campaign financing → more power → more contracts.

### Iran's parallel scandals

| Scandal | Period | Mechanism | Scale | Outcome |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Khosravi embezzlement** | 2011 | Forged bank documents to secure loans; bought assets including SSSK steelmaker | $2.6B | Executed (May 2014) — only figure in list killed |
| **Babak Zanjani** | 2012-2013 | Retained oil revenue from sanctions-evasion sales; claimed he was owed | $2.7B | Death sentence → commuted to 20 years (2024) after repaying $2.1B |
| **IRGC privatization** | 2005-2013 | State assets "privatized" under Ahmadinejad; 80%+ went to IRGC/bonyad affiliates | $120B | No prosecution — beneficiaries control the system |
| **Setad accumulation** | 1989-present | Assets confiscated from "enemies of the state" channeled to Leader's office | $95-200B | Off-budget; no oversight; no prosecution |

### The comparison

| Dimension | Brazil | Iran |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Defining scandal** | Petrolão ([[Petrobras]] kickbacks) | IRGC privatization |
| **Scale** | $1.6B+ (R$6.4B) | $120B+ |
| **Prosecutions** | 174 convictions | Zero for IRGC/bonyad capture |
| **Presidential impact** | Lula imprisoned; Dilma impeached | Ahmadinejad presided; no consequences |
| **Whistleblowers** | Plea bargains (Odebrecht executives) | None survive |
| **International exposure** | DOJ, SEC, Swiss cooperation | None — system controls all courts |

### Why outcomes "differ" — or do they?

| Factor | Brazil | Iran |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Initial prosecution** | Yes ([[Lava Jato]] convicted 174) | No |
| **Final outcome** | Convictions voided by STF | Never prosecuted |
| **Lead figures** | Lula: convicted → annulled → president | Ansari: charged → protected |
| **Prosecutors** | Moro/Dallagnol: barred/discredited | N/A — no independent prosecutors |
| **System status quo** | Restored | Never threatened |

**The difference is method, not result:**
- **Iran:** Never prosecutes connected figures
- **Brazil:** Prosecutes → convictions voided on procedural grounds → prosecutors punished → system restored

**Apparent advantages that didn't matter:**

| Factor | Brazil had it | Did it matter? |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Independent judiciary** | STF exists | STF voided convictions, dines with cronies |
| **Press freedom** | Globo/Folha exposed | Exposure didn't prevent reversal |
| **Political competition** | Opposition exposed | Then lost; prosecuted became president |
| **Plea bargains** | Enabled testimony | Testimony voided with convictions |

**The lesson:** Brazil's democratic institutions created a *longer path* to the same destination. Prosecution → conviction → appeal → reversal → restoration. Iran skips to restoration.

### The executed vs the protected

**Iran's "selective justice":**

| Name | Crime | Connected to | Outcome |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Mahafarid Khosravi | $2.6B banking fraud | Ahmadinejad network (fell from favor) | **Executed** |
| Babak Zanjani | $2.7B oil embezzlement | Sanctioned regime services (expendable) | Death sentence, commuted |
| **Ali Ansari** | $5B+ self-dealing | Mojtaba Khamenei (inner circle) | **Protected** |

**The lesson:** Iran prosecutes those who *fail to distribute* or *fall from favor*. Khosravi's crime wasn't fraud — it was being connected to Ahmadinejad when Ahmadinejad was out. Zanjani's crime was keeping too much. Ansari's protection comes from sharing with everyone.

**Brazil's "selective justice":**

| Name | Crime | Connected to | Outcome |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Lula | Petrolão beneficiary | PT, labor movement | Convicted → annulled → re-elected |
| José Dirceu | Mensalão mastermind | PT inner circle | Convicted, served time |
| Eduardo Cunha | Petrolão participant | PMDB/Centrão | Convicted (orchestrated Dilma impeachment first) |
| **Daniel Vorcaro** | Banco Master scheme | STF justices, Centrão | Arrested → Toffoli on case |

**The lesson:** Brazil prosecutes selectively too — Lula's conviction was annulled on procedural grounds; STF justices who attended Vorcaro's dinners now handle his case.

### The [[Lava Jato]] trajectory — voided by the regime

| Phase | Events | What it revealed |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **2014-2018** | Aggressive prosecution; Moro as judge/hero; 174 convictions | System seemed accountable |
| **2019** | Moro becomes Bolsonaro minister | Revealed political motivations; legitimacy questioned |
| **2019** | STF declares Moro "parcial" (biased) in Lula case | Technical grounds to void |
| **2021** | STF annuls ALL Lula convictions — venue, not innocence | Not exonerated; charges simply voided |
| **2021** | [[Lava Jato]] task force dismantled | PGR absorbs; momentum killed |
| **2022** | Dallagnol (lead prosecutor) barred from public office 8 years | Messengers punished |
| **2023** | Lula wins; governs WITH Centrão (Lira, Ciro Nogueira) | Prosecuted became president; "friends" became allies |
| **2025** | Banco Master: STF justices who voided [[Lava Jato]] now handle Vorcaro | Same court, same protections |

**What was voided:**
- Lula's convictions (annulled)
- Dirceu's remaining sentences (released)
- Dozens of Odebrecht-related convictions (procedural reversals)
- Moro's judicial career (declared biased, evidence tainted)
- Dallagnol's public career (barred)

**What remained:**
- The Centrão
- The STF justices
- The mechanisms

**The arc:** [[Lava Jato]] wasn't defeated by proving innocence — it was voided on procedural grounds by the same STF that now dines with Vorcaro. The system didn't reform; it **absorbed and neutralized** the threat.

### Key insight

| | Mensalão/Petrolão | IRGC/Bonyad capture |
|--|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Prosecuted** | Yes → then voided | No |
| **Prosecutors' fate** | Barred, discredited | N/A |
| **Lead figure's fate** | Lula: president again | Ansari: protected |
| **System reformed** | No | No |
| **New scandals** | Yes (Banco Master) | Yes (Ayandeh) |

**Prosecution without permanence is theater.** Brazil prosecuted Mensalão, prosecuted Petrolão — then voided the convictions, barred the prosecutors, and re-elected the convicted. The "accountability" was temporary; the system is permanent.

**The STF's dual role:**
- 2021: Voided Lula's convictions (procedural grounds)
- 2022-2025: Justices dined with Vorcaro, took R$129M contracts
- 2025: Same court handles Banco Master case

**Iran skips the theater.** No prosecution means no voiding needed. Same result, shorter path.

**Both systems demonstrate:** Mature political structures (~40 years) generate corruption scandals as a feature, not a bug. Brazil's democratic form creates the *appearance* of accountability — prosecution, conviction, imprisonment — then reverses it. Iran doesn't bother with appearances.

**The deeper parallel:** In both systems, those who threaten the network are neutralized (Moro/Dallagnol in Brazil; executed figures in Iran). Those who participate in the network are protected (Lula governs with Centrão; Ansari remains free).
