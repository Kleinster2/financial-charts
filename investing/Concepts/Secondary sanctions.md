# Secondary sanctions

#concept #geopolitics #sanctions #risk

Secondary sanctions — Penalties on third parties (non-US companies/countries) for doing business with sanctioned targets. Key US foreign policy tool. Two mechanisms: traditional ([[OFAC]] financial) and tariff-based (novel, Jan 2026).

---

## How it works

```
US sanctions [[Target]] Country
         ↓
Third-party country does business with [[Target]]
         ↓
US punishes third party (secondary sanctions)
```

Purpose: Force global compliance even when third parties have no US nexus. Leverage dollar dominance and US market access.

## Two mechanisms

| | Traditional ([[OFAC]]) | Tariff-based (NEW) |
|--|-------------------|---------------------|
| Tool | SDN list, block USD access | Import tariffs |
| [[Target]] | Specific companies, individuals, vessels | Entire countries |
| Legal basis | Established sanctions law | IEEPA (struck down Feb 20, 2026) |
| Enforcement | Treasury, seizures | Customs |
| Precedent | Decades of use | First use Jan 2026 |
| Example | Russia ([[Rosneft]], Lukoil) | Iran (25% tariff) |

---

## Current targets

### Russia — Traditional approach

| Tool | Detail |
|------|--------|
| G7 price cap | $60/barrel on Russian oil |
| Shadow fleet sanctions | ~600 vessels designated |
| Secondary sanctions | [[Rosneft]] + Lukoil (Jan 2025) |
| Coverage | ~50% of Russian oil production |

Mechanism: Non-US entities doing business with [[Rosneft]]/Lukoil blocked from US financial system.

Effectiveness: Leaky — 27% of Russian crude moves via shadow fleet, revenues only slightly reduced.

See [[Russia]] for details.

### Iran — Tariff-based approach (Jan 2026)

| Tool | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Tariff | 25% on any country "doing business with Iran" |
| Announced | Jan 12, 2026 (Truth Social) |
| Implementation | Unclear — no executive action published |
| Legal authority | IEEPA (struck down — [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]]) |

Affected countries:
| Country | Iran exposure | Potential tariff |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| China | 90%+ of Iran oil, $9B+ trade | +25% (to 74%+ total) |
| India | Major trading partner | +25% |
| UAE | [[Trade]] hub | +25% |
| Turkey | Regional partner | +25% |

See [[Iran]] for details.

## Affected third countries

| Country | Russia exposure | Iran exposure | Risk level |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| China | [[Oil]] buyer, tech supplier | 90% of oil trade | Very high |
| India | Discounted oil buyer | Trading partner | High |
| UAE | [[Trade]]/finance hub | [[Trade]] hub | Medium |
| Turkey | Energy, trade | Regional partner | Medium |
| [[EU]] | Limited (compliant) | Limited | Low |

## Investment implications

### Company-level risk

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Direct exposure | Companies trading with sanctioned entities |
| Supply chain | Unknowing use of sanctioned suppliers |
| Financial services | [[Banks]] processing sanctioned transactions |
| [[Shipping]]/insurance | Vessels, coverage for sanctioned cargo |

### Country-level risk

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| China secondary sanctions | Major supply chain disruption |
| India sanctions exposure | Pharma, IT services at risk |
| UAE as hub | [[Trade]] finance chokepoint |

### Sector exposure

| Sector | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Energy | [[Oil]] traders, refiners with Russia/Iran exposure |
| [[Shipping]] | Tanker companies, insurers |
| Banking | Correspondent banking, trade finance |
| [[Commodities]] | Metals, agriculture from sanctioned sources |
| Tech | Components to sanctioned countries |

---

## Evasion methods

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| Shadow fleet | Old tankers, opaque ownership, non-Western insurance |
| Ship-to-ship transfers | Transfer cargo at sea to clean vessels |
| Intermediaries | Route through third countries (UAE, Turkey) |
| False documentation | Fake origin certificates |
| Cryptocurrency | Avoid traditional banking |
| Yuan/ruble settlement | Bypass USD system |

Scale: ~600 shadow fleet vessels sanctioned by [[EU]], 27% of Russian crude moves through shadow channels.

---

## Enforcement actions (2026)

| Date | Action | [[Target]] |
|------|--------|--------|
| Jan 2 | Finland seized *Fitburg* | Russia shadow fleet |
| Jan 7 | US Navy seized *Marinera* | Russia shadow fleet |
| Nov 2025 | Ukraine drone strikes | Shadow tankers *Virat*, *Kairos*, *Dashan* |

---

## Legal challenges

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| IEEPA authority | Struck down — [[SCOTUS IEEPA ruling]] (Feb 20, 2026, 6-3) |
| Tariff-based approach | Invalid — IEEPA does not authorize tariffs per Supreme Court |
| Extraterritorial reach | Contested by [[EU]], China |

IEEPA struck down (Feb 20, 2026): Both IEEPA-based China tariffs (reciprocal, fentanyl) and Iran secondary tariffs invalidated. Traditional [[OFAC]] sanctions unaffected. Admin pivoting to Section 232/301 replacement authorities. $175B+ in collected IEEPA revenue at risk of refund.

---

## Historical precedents

| [[Target]] | Period | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Iran (pre-2015) | 2010-2015 | Effective — forced nuclear deal |
| Iran (post-2018) | 2018-present | Partial — China/India still buy oil |
| Russia | 2022-present | Limited — shadow fleet evasion |
| [[Huawei]] | 2019-present | Effective — cut off from US tech |
| North Korea | Ongoing | Highly effective — isolated |

---

- [ ] Admin replacement for Iran tariffs (post-IEEPA)
