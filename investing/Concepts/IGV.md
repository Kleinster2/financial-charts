## As AI disruption proxy

IGV is commonly used as shorthand for "software stocks" but it's a poor AI disruption proxy because it mixes:

- **AI winners:** Microsoft, Palantir, Oracle (infrastructure/platform plays)
- **AI victims:** Intuit, ServiceNow, Salesforce (workflow software at risk)

This is why IGV (-5.4%) underperformed [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] (-11.5%) on Feb 3 — the winners dilute the signal.

Our AIWD note shows AIWD -18% vs IGV -10% since Jan 2025, with the 8pp gap explained by IGV including software that *benefits* from AI.
