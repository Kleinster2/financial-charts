**Crypto** — Blockchain-based digital assets. Relevant to vault as: tokenization infrastructure, fintech disruption, speculative asset class, and Bitcoin as "digital gold."

---

## Why crypto matters for this vault

| Relevance | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Tokenization | Infrastructure for [[Tokenized private shares]] |
| [[Fintech]] | [[Robinhood]], [[Coinbase]] revenue driver |
| Bitcoin | [[Block]] strategy, store of value thesis |
| Stablecoins | [[Circle\|USDC]], [[Tether\|USDT]], payments infrastructure. BRL-pegged: [[BBRL]], [[BRLV]], [[BRZ]], [[BRLA]], [[BRL1]], [[cREAL]], [[BRD]] (yield-bearing) |
| AI intersection | Compute tokens, AI model marketplaces |

---

## Key assets

| Asset | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | Digital gold, store of value |
| Ethereum (ETH) | Smart contract platform |
| Stablecoins | Dollar-pegged ([[Circle\|USDC]], [[Tether\|USDT]]) |
| Others | Thousands of altcoins |

---

## Infrastructure companies

| Company | Role | Ticker |
|---------|------|--------|

## Regulatory landscape (US)

| Era | Stance |
|-----|--------|
| Gensler SEC (2021-2024) | Hostile, 100+ enforcement actions |
| Atkins SEC (2025+) | Pro-innovation, clearer rules |
| Behnam CFTC (2021-2025) | Mixed — proposed event contract restrictions |
| Selig CFTC (2025+) | Pro-innovation, "minimum effective dose" |

**Tailwind:** New administration aggressively pro-crypto.

### SEC-CFTC Harmonization (Jan 2026)

**Joint event (Jan 29, 2026):** [[Paul Atkins]] and [[Michael Selig]] announced coordinated approach:

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Crypto taxonomy** | Joint "commonsense" framework — securities vs commodities |
| **End enforcement-first** | Rulemaking before litigation |
| **Pension funds** | Atkins: "time is right" for crypto inclusion |

**Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act:** Senate Ag Committee passed (12-11 party line, Jan 29, 2026) — first crypto market structure bill to pass a Senate committee. Would give [[CFTC]] spot market authority over digital commodities.

## 2025: The Turning Point

A watershed year for US crypto policy under [[Trump II]]:

| Timeline | Event | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Jan 2025** | Paul Atkins appointed SEC Chair | End of "regulation by enforcement" (Gensler out). |
| **Q2 2025** | **SAB 121 Repealed** | [[Banks]] ([[JPMorgan Chase]], etc.) allowed to custody crypto assets. |
| **July 2025** | **[[GENIUS Act]] Passed** | Federal stablecoin framework; legitimizes USDC. |
| **Q4 2025** | **[[Strategic Bitcoin Reserve]]** | Lummis Bill introduced; US Gov to hold BTC. |

**Theme:** Shift from "Crackdown" to "Strategic Asset."

**Crypto infrastructure for real-world assets:**
- Private company shares ([[OpenAI]], [[SpaceX]] tokens)
- Real estate
- Art, collectibles
- Securities

See [[Tokenized private shares]] for deep dive.

## Bitcoin thesis

**Digital gold / store of value:**
- Fixed supply (21M cap)
- Decentralized
- [[Inflation]] hedge (debated)
- Institutional adoption growing

**Corporate treasury:** Some companies hold Bitcoin (MicroStrategy, [[Tesla]], Block).

|----------|----------|

| Security | Exchange hacks, wallet loss |
| Fraud | Scams, rug pulls |
