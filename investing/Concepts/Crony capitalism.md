**Crony capitalism** — Economic extraction via state resources flowing to politically connected private parties. Licenses, contracts, loans, and protection go to insiders rather than being allocated by market competition. The public (taxpayers, depositors, consumers) bears the cost.

One type of [[State-business relations]] — the extractive end of the spectrum. Distinct from:
- **Kleptocracy** — rulers steal directly for themselves
- **Private cronyism** — extraction via private networks (no state)
- **Regulatory capture** — favorable rules without direct extraction

## The pattern

```
Political connection
    → Preferential access (licenses, contracts, loans)
        → Wealth accumulation
            → Wealth buys more political protection
                → Regulatory immunity
                    → Extraction at public expense
                        → System stability depends on regime survival
```

**Key insight:** In crony systems, analyzing a company's fundamentals without understanding its political position is useless.

## How it manifests

| Mechanism | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Banking licenses** | Connected families get banks, use deposits for self-dealing |
| **State contracts** | Infrastructure, defense, resources go to insiders |
| **Regulatory forbearance** | Violations ignored, competitors harassed |
| **Land/permits** | Real estate requires political blessing |
| **Import/export licenses** | [[Trade]] monopolies granted to allies |
| **Privatization** | State assets sold to insiders at discount |
| **Debt forgiveness** | Connected borrowers don't repay; state absorbs losses |

## Case study: Iran — [[Ali Ansari]] / [[Ayandeh Bank]]

The template for regime-connected extraction:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Get banking license via political connections (Ahmadinejad, Mojtaba Khamenei) |
| 2 | Offer high deposit rates to attract public savings |
| 3 | "Lend" deposits to yourself via ~100 shell companies |
| 4 | Build illiquid assets (Iran Mall, hotels) |
| 5 | Never repay loans ($1.21B extracted) |
| 6 | When bank fails, CBI prints money / state bank absorbs |
| 7 | Depositors wiped out via inflation |
| 8 | You keep the assets |
| 9 | Criminal charges filed → connections protect you |

**Result:** 7 million depositors lost $2.34B. Ansari kept his real estate empire. [[UK]] sanctioned him; Iran didn't prosecute.

**Why it matters:** [[Ayandeh Bank]]'s collapse accelerated the [[Iranian economic collapse]] — cronyism has macro consequences.

## Country patterns

### Iran

| Actor | Connection | Extraction |
|-------|------------|------------|
| [[Ali Ansari]] | Mojtaba Khamenei (Supreme Leader's son) | [[Ayandeh Bank]] — $1.21B |
| IRGC | Military-state fusion | ~50% of economy, NPLs across banking system |
| Bonyads | Revolutionary foundations | Tax-exempt conglomerates |

**System:** Revolutionary elite + IRGC control banking, industry, trade. Private sector exists at their pleasure.

See [[Iranian banking]] for sector-wide capture.

### Russia

| Actor | Connection | Extraction |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Oligarchs (1990s) | Yeltsin "loans for shares" | Privatized Soviet assets |
| Siloviki (2000s+) | Putin/FSB | Renationalized strategic sectors |
| Sanctioned oligarchs | Kremlin proximity | Yachts, London real estate |

**System:** State controls "commanding heights" (energy, defense, banking). Oligarchs exist at Putin's discretion — demonstrated by Khodorkovsky (jailed), Prigozhin (killed).

### China

| Actor | Connection | Extraction |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Princelings | CCP elite families | SOE leadership, private equity |
| Red aristocracy | Revolutionary lineage | Land, finance, tech |
| Jack Ma | Tolerated until threatening | Ant Group IPO killed |

**System:** Party controls all. Private wealth exists within "cage" — get too big or too political, get crushed. [[Alibaba]], Didi crackdowns showed limits.

### Gulf States

| Actor | Connection | Extraction |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Royal families | Birthright | [[Oil]] revenues, sovereign wealth |
| Merchant families | Historical alliance with royals | Exclusive licenses, agencies |
| MBS allies | Ritz-Carlton survivors | New power structure |

**System:** Royal family = state = economy. Private sector operates via royal license. Saudi Ritz-Carlton "anti-corruption" was power consolidation.

### [[Southeast Asia]]

| Country | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| **Indonesia** | Suharto family conglomerates; post-98 oligarch politics |
| **Malaysia** | 1MDB — sovereign wealth as slush fund |
| **Philippines** | Marcos kleptocracy; family dynasties |
| **Thailand** | Monarchy-military-tycoon triangle |

### Brazil

**"Capitalismo de compadrio"** — state contracts + development bank financing + political donations = extraction cycle. Persists across administrations.

| Scandal | Period | Scale |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Lava Jato]] | 2014-2021 | R$14.3B recovered, 174 convictions |
| Mensalão | 2005 | BB marketing contracts, PT operatives convicted |
| Orçamento secreto | 2020-present | R$16-19B/year in secret earmarks |
| 1990s bank failures | 1995-1997 | Political family banks collapsed |

**Vehicles:** State banks (BNDES, Caixa, BB), pension funds, FI-FGTS, congressional earmarks.

**System:** Democratic but fragmented politics require patronage. Centrão brokers support for any president. Even successful crackdowns get reversed.

See [[Brazilian cronyism]] for full detail.

## Investment implications

### Risk factors

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Regime change** | Connected companies collapse with patrons |
| **Factional shifts** | Wrong faction = assets seized |
| **Sanctions** | Western sanctions target cronies |
| **Sudden crackdowns** | China-style "common prosperity" |
| **Nationalization** | Assets taken when convenient |
| **Opacity** | True ownership hidden |

### Due diligence questions

| Question | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Who really owns this? | Beneficial ownership often hidden |
| Which faction? | Wrong patron = existential risk |
| How did they get the license? | Merit or connection? |
| What happens if regime changes? | Asset tied to political survival? |
| Are they sanctioned/sanction-adjacent? | [[Secondary sanctions]] risk |
| Is the founder still in favor? | Jack Ma, Khodorkovsky examples |

### Uninvestable vs investable cronyism

| Type | Example | Investability |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Hard authoritarian** | Iran, North Korea | Uninvestable — sanctions, opacity |
| **Soft authoritarian** | Russia, China | Caution — regime risk, crackdown risk |
| **Weak institutions** | [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]] | Selective — understand the politics |
| **Democratic but captured** | Brazil, [[Mexico]] | Investable — but scrutinize state contracts |
| **Hybrid** | Turkey, Gulf | Case by case |

## The banking pattern

[[Banks]] are the preferred extraction vehicle. See [[Bank cronyism]] for the full pattern.

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Deposit access** | Public savings = free money |
| **Leverage** | Small capital controls large assets |
| **Opacity** | Loan books hard to scrutinize |
| **Central bank backstop** | Prints money to cover losses |
| **Socialized losses** | Depositors/taxpayers absorb failure |

**Examples:**
- [[Ayandeh Bank]] (Iran) — Ansari extraction
- Brazilian family banks (1990s) — Econômico, Nacional, Bamerindus
- Russian banks (1990s) — oligarch vehicles
- 1MDB (Malaysia) — sovereign wealth looting

## Cronyism vs corruption

| | Corruption | Crony capitalism |
|--|------------|------------------|
| **Scale** | Transaction-level | System-level |
| **Mechanism** | Bribes for specific acts | Structural advantage |
| **Stability** | Can exist in strong institutions | Requires weak institutions |
| **Visibility** | Often hidden | Often open/normalized |
| **Example** | Paying official for permit | Owning the permit-granting ministry |

Crony capitalism is **institutionalized corruption** — the system itself is the problem.

---

## Indicators

| [[Signal]] | What it suggests |
|--------|------------------|
| Banking sector NPLs concentrated in connected borrowers | Extraction ongoing |
| Tycoons on Forbes list with no clear business model | Political rents |
| Privatizations to insiders at discount | Asset stripping |
| Business leaders with regime family ties | Structural cronyism |
| Sudden wealth destruction (Jack Ma, oligarch arrests) | Regime asserting control |
| "Anti-corruption" campaigns targeting one faction | Political purge, not reform |
