**Monetary policy primer** — foundational central banking and interest rate concepts for macro investing. Understanding monetary policy helps evaluate rate sensitivity, liquidity conditions, and asset allocation.

> **Key insight:** Central banks control the price of money (interest rates) and the quantity of money (balance sheet). These two levers ripple through every asset class. "Don't fight the Fed" exists for a reason.

## What central banks do

| Function | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Price stability** | Target inflation (~2%) |
| **Full employment** | Support labor market |
| **Financial stability** | Lender of last resort |
| **Payment system** | Operate interbank settlement |

The Fed has a **dual mandate:** price stability + maximum employment. ECB has single mandate (price stability).

## Interest rate framework

### Policy rate

The rate central banks directly control.

| Central bank | Policy rate | Current (Jan 2026) |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Federal Reserve** | Fed Funds Rate | ~4.25% |
| **ECB** | Deposit Facility Rate | ~2.5% |
| **BoJ** | Overnight Call Rate | ~0.5% |
| **BoE** | Bank Rate | ~4.0% |

### How the Fed controls rates

Fed sets a **target range** (e.g., 4.25-4.50%). Enforces via:

| Tool | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **IOER** (Interest on Reserves) | Floor — banks won't lend below this |
| **Reverse repo (ON RRP)** | Floor — money funds park cash here |
| **Discount window** | Ceiling — banks can borrow here |

Actual fed funds rate trades within the corridor.

## The yield curve

Interest rates across maturities.

```
Normal (upward sloping):
  Short rates < Long rates
  Economy healthy, inflation expectations contained

Inverted:
  Short rates > Long rates
  Recession signal (historically reliable)

Steep:
  Large spread between short and long
  Recovery expectations, Fed easing
```

| Spread | What it measures |
|--------|------------------|
| 2s10s | 10Y minus 2Y Treasury — classic inversion signal |
| 3m10y | 10Y minus 3M Treasury — Fed's preferred |
| Term premium | Extra yield for duration risk |

**Yield curve inversion:** Has preceded every US recession since 1970. Lead time: 6-18 months.

---

## Quantitative easing (QE)

Central bank buys assets (Treasuries, MBS) to:
- Lower long-term rates
- Inject reserves into banking system
- Signal commitment to easy policy

```
QE mechanics:
Fed buys Treasury → Creates reserves → Bank deposits increase
                                      → Rates fall
                                      → Asset prices rise
```

| QE round | Period | Size |
|----------|--------|------|
| QE1 | 2008-2010 | $1.7T |
| QE2 | 2010-2011 | $600B |
| QE3 | 2012-2014 | $1.6T |
| COVID QE | 2020-2022 | $4.8T |

**Peak Fed balance sheet:** ~$9T (2022).

---

## Quantitative tightening (QT)

Reverse of QE. Fed lets bonds mature without reinvesting.

```
QT mechanics:
Treasury matures → Fed doesn't reinvest → Reserves shrink
                                        → Liquidity tightens
```

| QT period | Pace |
|-----------|------|
| 2017-2019 | $50B/month |
| 2022-present | $95B/month (peak) |

**Risks:** Can trigger liquidity crises if done too fast (repo spike Sept 2019).

---

## Money markets

Short-term funding markets (<1 year).

### Fed funds market

Banks lend reserves to each other overnight. Rate = effective fed funds rate.

### Repo market

Collateralized overnight lending.

```
Repo:
Borrower sells Treasury → Receives cash → Buys back next day + interest
```

| Type | Counterparty |
|------|--------------|
| Tri-party repo | Cleared through BNY Mellon/JPM |
| Bilateral repo | Direct between parties |
| Fed repo | Fed as counterparty |

**Repo crisis (Sept 2019):** Rates spiked to 10%. Fed intervened. Revealed reserves were scarcer than expected.

### Reverse repo (ON RRP)

Money market funds park excess cash at Fed overnight. Massive facility ($2T+ at peak).

**Why it matters:** When ON RRP drains, liquidity shifts to banking system. Watched closely.

---

## Transmission mechanism

How policy rates affect the economy:

```
Fed raises rates
      ↓
Short-term rates rise (money markets, CDs)
      ↓
Bank lending rates rise (mortgages, business loans)
      ↓
Borrowing decreases, spending slows
      ↓
Demand falls, inflation cools
      ↓
(Eventually) Unemployment rises
```

**Lags:** Monetary policy operates with "long and variable lags." 12-18 months typical.

## Inflation metrics

| Metric | What it measures | Fed preference |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **CPI** | Consumer prices | Headline number |
| **Core CPI** | Ex-food, energy | Less volatile |
| **PCE** | Personal consumption | **Fed's target** |
| **Core PCE** | Ex-food, energy | **Primary focus** |
| **Supercore** | Services ex-housing | Wage pressure proxy |

**Target:** 2% core PCE (average over time).

### Inflation expectations

| Measure | Source |
|---------|--------|
| TIPS breakevens | Market-implied (10Y nominal − 10Y TIPS) |
| Michigan survey | Consumer expectations |
| Fed's SEP | FOMC projections |

**Anchored expectations:** Key to Fed credibility. If expectations unanchor, harder to control actual inflation.

---

## FOMC and communication

### Federal Open Market Committee

12 voting members (7 governors + 5 regional presidents on rotation).

| Meeting | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| FOMC meetings | 8 per year |
| Rate decisions | Each meeting |
| SEP (dot plot) | Quarterly (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec) |

### Communication tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Statement** | Policy decision, rationale |
| **Press conference** | Chair explains, takes questions |
| **Minutes** | Detailed discussion (3 weeks later) |
| **Dot plot** | Individual rate projections |
| **Fedspeak** | Speeches, interviews |

**Forward guidance:** Telling markets what Fed plans to do. Powerful tool — can move rates without acting.

---

## Neutral rate (r*)

The rate that neither stimulates nor restricts growth.

| Estimate | Source |
|----------|--------|
| ~2.5% nominal | Fed's long-run projection |
| ~0.5% real | r* models (Laubach-Williams) |

**Problem:** Unobservable. Only know in hindsight if policy was tight or loose.

**Post-COVID debate:** Has r* risen? If yes, rates stay "higher for longer."

---

## Global central banks

| Bank | Mandate | Style |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Fed** | Dual (inflation + employment) | Data-dependent |
| **ECB** | Price stability | Slower to move |
| **BoJ** | Price stability | Ultra-loose (until recently) |
| **BoE** | Inflation target (2%) | Independent |
| **PBOC** | Multiple objectives | Managed float, directed lending |

### Policy divergence

When central banks move different directions:
- Currency impacts (rate differentials drive flows)
- Carry trade opportunities
- Capital flow volatility

---

## Financial conditions

Broader measure than just rates. Includes:

| Component | Measure |
|-----------|---------|
| Interest rates | Fed funds, 10Y Treasury |
| Credit spreads | IG, HY spreads over Treasuries |
| Equity prices | Stock market levels |
| Dollar | Trade-weighted index |
| Volatility | VIX |

**Financial conditions indexes:** Goldman, Chicago Fed, Bloomberg. Fed watches these — can offset rate hikes if conditions tighten too fast.

---

## Key concepts

### Real vs nominal rates

```
Real rate = Nominal rate − Inflation expectations
```

**Real rate matters for economic decisions.** Negative real rates = stimulative even if nominal rates are positive.

### Term premium

Extra yield investors demand for holding longer-term bonds.

```
10Y yield = Expected short rates over 10 years + Term premium
```

Term premium has been negative at times (flight to safety, QE effects).

### Policy stance

| Stance | Rates vs neutral | Effect |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Restrictive** | Above r* | Slows economy |
| **Neutral** | At r* | Neither helps nor hurts |
| **Accommodative** | Below r* | Stimulates economy |

## Historical episodes

| Episode | Period | Lesson |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Volcker disinflation | 1979-1982 | High rates can break inflation (painfully) |
| Greenspan put | 1987-2006 | Fed backstop creates moral hazard |
| Zero bound | 2008-2015 | When rates hit zero, need unconventional tools |
| Taper tantrum | 2013 | Communication matters — markets front-run |
| 2022-23 hikes | 2022-2023 | Fastest hikes in 40 years (0 → 5.25%) |

---

## Key metrics for investors

| Metric | What it signals |
|--------|-----------------|
| Fed funds rate | Policy stance |
| 2Y Treasury | Near-term rate expectations |
| 10Y Treasury | Growth/inflation expectations |
| 2s10s spread | Recession risk |
| TIPS breakevens | Inflation expectations |
| Dollar (DXY) | Relative policy tightness |
| HY spreads | Credit conditions, risk appetite |
