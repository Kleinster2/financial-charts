# Cloud vs on-premise valuation

**Why SaaS trades at 5-15x revenue while on-premise software trades at 1-3x.** The difference comes down to revenue quality: recurring vs one-time, predictability vs lumpy, and the operating leverage that compounds over time.

---

## The valuation gap

| Model | Revenue type | Gross margin | Typical multiple |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **On-premise (legacy)** | One-time license + maintenance | 50-70% | 1-3x revenue |
| **Cloud/SaaS** | Recurring subscription | 70-85% | 5-15x revenue |

**Why the gap exists:**

| Factor | On-premise | SaaS |
|--------|------------|------|
| **Revenue visibility** | Lumpy, deal-dependent | Predictable, contractual |
| **Customer lifetime** | One sale + optional maintenance | Continuous relationship |
| **Upsell potential** | Requires new sale cycle | Seat expansion, tier upgrades |
| **Switching costs** | Medium (can run perpetual) | High (data in cloud, workflows built) |
| **Operating leverage** | Limited | Compounds at scale |
| **Cash flow** | Front-loaded | Spreads but grows |

---

## The math

### On-premise
```
Year 1: $1M license + $200K maintenance
Year 2: $200K maintenance
Year 3: $200K maintenance
Total 3-year: $1.6M
```

### SaaS (same customer)
```
Year 1: $400K subscription
Year 2: $480K (+20% expansion)
Year 3: $576K (+20% expansion)
Total 3-year: $1.456M (and growing)
```

SaaS looks worse initially but **compounds** — by Year 5, the SaaS customer is worth more AND still growing.

## Key SaaS metrics that drive multiples

| Metric | Definition | Premium threshold |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **NRR** (Net Revenue Retention) | Revenue from existing customers YoY | >120% |
| **Gross margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | >75% |
| **Rule of 40** | Growth % + FCF margin % | >40% |
| **CAC payback** | Months to recover acquisition cost | <12 months |

High NRR is the killer metric — it means customers expand faster than they churn, so you grow even with zero new sales.

## The transition pain

Companies moving from on-premise to SaaS experience a **revenue valley**:

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Year 1-2** | License revenue drops, subscriptions ramp slowly |
| **Year 2-3** | Revenue may decline or flatten |
| **Year 3-5** | Subscription base compounds, growth accelerates |
| **Year 5+** | Higher revenue AND higher margins than before |

**Examples:**
- **Adobe** (2013-2017): Revenue flat for 3 years, then doubled
- **Microsoft** (2014-2019): Azure/O365 transition, stock 4x
- **Autodesk** (2016-2020): 40% revenue decline, then 2x

Markets often punish companies during the valley, creating opportunity.

## Why switching costs matter

| On-premise | SaaS |
|------------|------|
| Customer owns software perpetually | Customer rents access |
| Can delay upgrades indefinitely | Always on latest version |
| Data stays on-premise | Data in vendor's cloud |
| Workflows independent | Workflows built on platform |

**SaaS lock-in compounds over time** — the more data and workflows in the system, the harder to leave. This is why NRR often *increases* as customers mature.

---

## Current market context

Post-2022 rate hikes compressed SaaS multiples:

| Period | Median SaaS multiple |
|--------|---------------------|
| 2021 peak | 15-20x revenue |
| 2022 trough | 5-8x revenue |
| 2025 | 7-12x revenue |

Higher rates → higher discount rates → lower present value of future cash flows. SaaS is a long-duration asset, so it's rate-sensitive.

## Investment relevance

**Why this matters:**

1. **Transition opportunities** — Companies in the "valley" often undervalued (if they'll make it through).

2. **Multiple expansion** — As cloud mix rises, market re-rates the stock (see [[TOTVS]]).

3. **Rate sensitivity** — SaaS is a levered bet on rates; rising rates compress multiples.

4. **Quality screen** — NRR >120% + gross margin >75% = durable compounder.

5. **Beware fake SaaS** — Some companies rebrand as "cloud" but lack recurring economics.
