**Collateralized loan obligation (CLO)** — Structured vehicle that pools leveraged loans and issues tranches of debt and equity against them. Typically leveraged **9-10x equity**, versus ~1x for [[BDC]]s holding similar assets. Popular with insurance companies due to high ratings on senior tranches and beneficial capital treatment.

## Why it matters now

In the [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]], [[Barclays]] warned that loans sold from Blue Owl's BDCs would likely be repackaged into Blue Owl-managed CLOs and purchased by [[Kuvare]] (Blue Owl's own insurer). This shifts the same private credit assets from transparent, low-leverage BDC structures into opaque, high-leverage CLO structures — making systemic risk harder to track. See [[PE-insurance convergence]].

| Structure | Leverage | Transparency | Investor base |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| BDC | ~1x | Public filings | Retail + institutional |
| CLO | 9-10x | Limited | Insurance, banks, pensions |
