# GDP Growth Forecasts

Tracking real GDP growth forecasts by country and how they evolve across forecast vintages. The gap between forecast and actual — and the direction of revisions — often matters more than the level itself.

## World Bank — January 2026

*Source: Global Economic Prospects, January 2026*

| Region | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Global | 2.7 | 2.6 | 2.7 |
| [[United States]] | 2.1 | 2.2 | — |
| East Asia & Pacific | — | 4.4 | 4.3 |
| Europe & Central Asia | — | 2.4 | 2.7 |
| Latin America & Caribbean | — | 2.3 | — |
| Low-Income Countries | 5.0 | 5.7 | 5.6 |

World Bank uses market exchange rate weighting (vs IMF PPP) — hence lower global figure.

## Forecast comparison by source (2026)

Key economies where forecasters diverge:

### [[United States]]

| Source | 2026 GDP | Date |
|--------|----------|------|
| IMF WEO | 2.4% | Jan 2026 |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | 2.5% Q4/Q4 (2.8% full-year) | Jan 2026 |
| World Bank | 2.2% | Jan 2026 |
| Bloomberg consensus | 2.0% | Dec 2025 |
| FOMC projection | 2.3% | Dec 2025 |

Goldman is the bull — sees tax cuts, AI [[Productivity]], and real wage gains driving above-consensus growth. Bloomberg consensus is most conservative.

### [[China]]

| Source | 2026 GDP | Date |
|--------|----------|------|
| IMF WEO | 4.5% | Jan 2026 |
| [[Deutsche Bank]] | 4.5% | Jan 2026 |
| Fitch | 4.1% | Jan 2026 |

IMF revised China up +0.3pp in Jan 2026 (from 4.2% in Oct). But structural headwinds persist — see [[China economic transition]]. Property drag, investment collapse, weak consumer. Government target for 2025 was 5.0% and was met exactly.

### [[India]]

| Source | 2026 GDP | Date |
|--------|----------|------|
| IMF WEO | 6.4% (FY) / 6.3% (CY) | Jan 2026 |
| Government budget target | 6.8-7.2% | Feb 2026 |
| Economists | ~6.5% | Feb 2026 |

Fastest-growing major economy. Arvind Subramanian warns GDP deflator issues may overstate growth — see [[India macro]].

### [[Brazil]]

| Source | 2026 GDP | Date |
|--------|----------|------|
| IMF WEO | 1.6% | Jan 2026 |
| [[BBVA]] Research | 2.0-2.2% | Dec 2025 |

Sharp deceleration from 2.5% (2025E). 15% [[Selic]] rate is the binding constraint — see [[Brazil]].

## Key divergences and narratives

US exceptionalism persists — US at 2.4% vs [[EU|Euro Area]] at 1.3%. Gap driven by AI investment, fiscal stimulus, and labor market flexibility. [[Goldman Sachs]] sees further upside from [[Productivity]] gains.

[[China]] structural deceleration — 5.0% → 4.5% → 4.0% glide path. Traditional economy (property, infrastructure) collapsing faster than new industries can replace. See [[China economic transition]].

[[Brazil]] rate trap — IMF's 1.6% is well below recent trend (3.2% avg 2022-24). [[Selic]] at 15% is crushing corporates. See [[Brazil corporate bond rout February 2026]].

[[Germany]] lagging — 0.2% in 2025 is effectively stagnation. Energy cost hangover, auto sector disruption, fiscal conservatism. Worst performer among major advanced economies.

[[India]] as outlier — only major economy consistently above 6%. But GDP measurement concerns and private consumption weakness warrant caution.
