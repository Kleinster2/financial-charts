# [[China]] Nuclear Buildout

[[China]] is building more nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined. 20+ under construction.

---

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reactors operating | 55+ |
| Reactors under construction | 20+ |
| Global share of new builds | >50% |
| Flagship reactor | Hualong One (indigenous) |

## Zhangzhou Nuclear Base

World's largest nuclear base using single domestic reactor design:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Fujian Province |
| Reactor type | Hualong One (indigenous 3rd-gen PWR) |
| Total units | 6 planned |
| Completed | Unit 1 (Jan 2025), Unit 2 (Jan 2026) |
| Annual output (6 units) | 60 billion kWh |
| CO2 avoided | ~50 million tons/year |

Unit 2 passed 168-hour full-power test on January 1, 2026.

## Hualong One reactor

[[China]]'s flagship indigenous reactor design:

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Type | 3rd-gen pressurized water reactor |
| Output per unit | 10 billion kWh/year |
| IP | Fully Chinese-owned |
| Certification | [[EU]] (EUR), [[UK]] (GDA) approved |
| Global status | Most deployed 3rd-gen reactor worldwide |

**Export potential:** Hualong One is export-ready with international certifications. Competes with [[Westinghouse]] AP1000, French EPR.

## [[China]] vs US nuclear

| Factor | [[China]] | US |
|--------|-------|-----|
| New reactors | 20+ under construction | 2 (Vogtle 3&4 just completed) |
| Build time | ~5 years | 10+ years (Vogtle: 14 years, $35B) |
| Cost overruns | Minimal | Massive (Vogtle 2x budget) |
| Permitting | State-directed | Multi-year NRC process |
| Restarts | N/A (building new) | TMI restart = 2028 (maybe) |
| SMRs | Deploying | [[NuScale]] canceled, 2030s? |

**The gap:** [[China]] is deploying proven reactors at scale. US is restarting old plants and waiting for SMRs that may never arrive.

## Pipeline

Major projects beyond Zhangzhou:

| Site | Reactors | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Zhangzhou | 6 Hualong One | 2 operating, 4 building |
| Taipingling | 6 Hualong One | Building |
| Sanmen | 4 AP1000 | 2 operating, 2 building |
| Haiyang | 4 AP1000 | 2 operating, 2 building |
| Various | CAP1400 (upscaled AP1000) | Building |

## Why nuclear + solar

| Power type | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Solar** | Cheap, fast to build | Intermittent, land-intensive |
| **Nuclear** | Baseload 24/7, dense | Slow to build, expensive |

**[[China]]'s approach:** Both. Solar for bulk capacity, nuclear for reliable baseload. Not either/or.

## AI implications

Nuclear provides the baseload that solar can't:

| Requirement | Solar | Nuclear |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| AI training (24/7) | Needs storage | Native fit |
| Data center (constant) | Needs backup | Native fit |
| Industrial load | Variable match | Perfect match |

Combined with [[China solar buildout]], [[China]] has both intermittent and baseload covered.
