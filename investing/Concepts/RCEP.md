## Key terms

### Tariff elimination

| Category | Coverage | Timeline |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Industrial goods | 90%+ | 20 years |
| Agriculture | 65% | Varies |
| Sensitive items | Excluded | Rice, beef (Japan) |

**Less ambitious** than CPTPP (99%) — accommodates developing members.

### Rules of origin

| Feature | RCEP approach |
|---------|---------------|
| Cumulation | Regional (all 15 members) |
| Content threshold | 40% regional value |
| Self-certification | Phased in |
| Complexity | Simple vs USMCA |

**Key innovation:** Single set of rules across 15 countries. Enables supply chain integration.

### Services

| Sector | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Liberalization | Modest |
| Negative list | Only for some members |
| Mode 4 (movement) | Limited |
| Financial | Basic MFN |

Less ambitious than CPTPP on services.

### E-commerce

| Provision | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Data localization | Not addressed (China blocked) |
| Source code | Not addressed |
| Customs duties | Banned on digital |
| Consumer protection | Basic provisions |

Weaker than USMCA/CPTPP due to China's data sovereignty position.

### Investment

| Feature | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Market access | Improved |
| ISDS | Not included |
| National treatment | With exceptions |

No investor-state dispute settlement — major difference from TPP.

### Intellectual property

| Copyright | 70 years (some) |
| GIs | Basic protection |
| Enforcement | Moderate |

Not TRIPS-plus like CPTPP.

## Strategic significance

### China's win

| Dimension | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| **US absence** | China shapes regional trade rules |
| **First FTA with Japan/Korea** | Historic (through RCEP) |
| **Supply chain anchor** | Cementing Asia manufacturing |
| **Counter to CPTPP** | Alternative framework |
| **Belt & Road complement** | Trade rules + infrastructure |

### Japan/Korea calculus

| Country | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| **Japan** | Access to China + hedge against US uncertainty |
| **Korea** | Caught between US/China, hedging |

Both also in CPTPP — diversification strategy.

### ASEAN centrality

| Role | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Convenor | ASEAN initiated RCEP |
| Balance | Not China-dominated formally |
| Integration | Single rules for ASEAN+5 |

## Comparison to CPTPP

| Dimension | RCEP | CPTPP |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Members | 15 (incl. China) | 11 (no US/China) |
| Population | 2.2B | 500M |
| GDP | $26T | $13T |
| Tariff coverage | 90% | 99% |
| Services | Modest | Deep |
| Digital | Weak | Strong |
| Labor/environment | Minimal | Suspended (was strong) |
| Rules of origin | Simple (40%) | Moderate (45-55%) |

RCEP = broader but shallower. CPTPP = narrower but deeper.

## India withdrawal

| Issue | India concern |
|-------|---------------|
| China trade deficit | Would worsen |
| Manufacturing | Chinese competition |
| Dairy/agriculture | NZ competition |
| Services | Not enough access |

**India withdrew Nov 2019.** Door left open but unlikely to rejoin.
