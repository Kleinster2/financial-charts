Rule 22e-4 — [[SEC]] rule adopted in 2016 requiring registered open-end mutual funds and ETFs (excluding money market funds) to establish liquidity risk management programs. Best known for the 15% cap on illiquid securities.

## Key provisions

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Scope | All registered open-end funds and open-end ETFs (not money market) |
| Illiquid cap | 15% of net assets maximum in illiquid investments |
| Illiquid definition | Cannot be sold in 7 calendar days without significantly changing market value |
| Classification | Four buckets: highly liquid, moderately liquid, less liquid, illiquid |
| Program | Written liquidity risk management program required |
| Board reporting | Breach of 15% must be reported to board with remediation plan |
| SEC notification | Confidential notification required if illiquid holdings exceed 15% |
| Remediation | If still above 15% after 30 days, board must reassess plan |

## Liquidity classifications

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Highly liquid | Convertible to cash in 3 business days without significant price impact |
| Moderately liquid | Convertible to cash in 3-7 calendar days without significant price impact |
| Less liquid | Can be sold in 7+ calendar days without significant price impact, but sale period is uncertain |
| Illiquid | Cannot be sold in 7 calendar days without significant price impact |

The distinction between "less liquid" and "illiquid" is critical — only illiquid counts toward the 15% cap. [[Baron Capital]] exploits this by classifying [[SpaceX]] shares as "less liquid" rather than illiquid, citing the active secondary market.

## Proposed amendments (Nov 2022)

The [[SEC]] proposed tightening the rule:
- Require funds to assume sale of 10% of each position ("vertical slice") rather than reasonably anticipated trade size
- Remove the "less liquid" category entirely — reclassify all such holdings as illiquid, subject to the 15% cap

If adopted, this would force funds like [[Baron Capital]]'s BPTRX (~29% SpaceX) to either divest or seek exemptive relief. The proposal has not been finalized as of Feb 2026.

## First enforcement action (May 2023)

The [[SEC]] brought its first [[Rule 22e-4]] enforcement action against a New York-based investment adviser whose fund held over 21% illiquid assets between June 2019 and June 2020. Rather than reducing illiquid holdings, the adviser reclassified illiquid investments as "less liquid" — the same classification strategy [[Baron Capital]] currently uses for SpaceX, though Baron argues its case is distinguishable due to SpaceX's active secondary market.

## Why it matters

The rule is the key regulatory constraint on mutual fund and ETF exposure to private companies. As private markets grow (SpaceX, [[Stripe]], [[xAI]]), more funds push against the 15% boundary. The "less liquid" loophole allows significant private exposure — but proposed amendments could close it, forcing portfolio restructuring across the industry.
