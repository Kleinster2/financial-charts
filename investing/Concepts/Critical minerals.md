**Critical minerals** — Raw material inputs [[China]] dominates. Stronger leverage than US commodities — limited substitutes, years to build alternatives.

---

## [[China]]'s dominance

| Mineral | [[China]] share | Use | Substitutes |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| [[Gallium]] | 99% refining | [[Semiconductors]], [[5G]], radar | Very limited |
| [[Germanium]] | 60% refining | Fiber optics, IR, solar | Limited |
| [[Antimony]] | 48% | **Ammunition** (none), flame retardants | **None** |
| Graphite | 65% | EV batteries | Limited |
| Rare earths | 60%+ processing | Magnets, defense, EVs | Years to build |

**Bottom line:** [[China]] can inflict real pain. These aren't commodities with spot market substitutes.

## Rare earths

Separate from critical minerals but related:

| Stage | [[China]] share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | ~60% |
| Processing | ~90% |
| Magnet production | ~90% |

**Applications:** EV motors, wind turbines, defense (guidance, jets), electronics

See [[Rare earth leverage]], [[Rare earth elements]].

## Deployment history

| Date | Action | [[Target]] | Context |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| Aug 2023 | Gallium/germanium export controls | Global | Response to US chip restrictions |
| Oct 2023 | Graphite export permits required | Global | EV battery pressure |
| Dec 2025 | Ga/Ge controls suspended | US | Exchange for Affiliate Rule suspension |
| **Jan 2026** | **Dual-use equipment ban** | **Japan** | **PM Takaichi [[Taiwan]] comments** |
| Jan 2026 | Dichlorosilane anti-dumping probe | Japan | Chip manufacturing chemical |

**Jan 2026 Japan escalation:** [[China]] banned exports of dual-use equipment including sensors, semiconductors, batteries, chemicals, and items using rare earths. Triggered by PM Takaichi saying [[Taiwan]] contingency could necessitate Japan military response. See [[China-Japan relations]].

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for full countermeasure list.

## Why no substitutes?

| Mineral | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Gallium | No other country has refining capacity at scale |
| Germanium | Same — [[China]] built infrastructure over decades |
| Antimony | Literally no substitute for ammunition primers |
| Graphite | Alternative sources (Mozambique, [[Canada]]) years away |
| Rare earths | Processing expertise concentrated in [[China]] |

**US response:** DoD stockpiling, [[MP Materials]] expansion, but years behind.

## Emerging non-[[China]] sources

### Western Hemisphere

| Country | Potential | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **[[Venezuela]]** | ~300K metric tons (claimed) | US control post-Maduro; unverified reserves |
| **Ukraine** | Rare earths, lithium | Part of US deal structure |
| **[[Canada]]** | Processing capacity | REalloys building first NA heavy rare earth refinery (Saskatchewan) |
| **[[Greenland]]** | Rare earths, uranium | Trump territorial interest |

**[[Venezuela]] caveat:** Reserves disputed. Rare Earth Exchanges (Dec 2025) says [[Venezuela]] deposits "do not rival [[China]], [[Australia]], or US" — primarily monazite-bearing sands in Guayana Shield. 3-6 year timeline if developed.

**Strategic logic:** "Mosaic" approach — piece together multiple sources to counter [[China]]'s chokehold. No single source replaces [[China]]; diversification is the goal.

See [[Venezuela oil rebuild]] for rare earths section.

## Investment implications

**If [[China]] restricts:**
- Non-[[China]] miners rally ([[MP Materials]], Lynas, Perpetua Resources)
- [[Defense]] stocks at risk (supply chain exposure)
- EV cost inflation
- Battery recyclers gain ([[Redwood Materials]], Li-Cycle)

**Key names:**
| Company | Mineral | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [[MP Materials]] | Rare earths | US (California) |
| Lynas | Rare earths | [[Australia]] |
| Perpetua Resources | Antimony | US (Idaho) |
| Syrah Resources | Graphite | Mozambique |
| REalloys | Heavy rare earths | [[Canada]] (Saskatchewan) — first NA refinery |

## US policy response

| Date | Action | Scale |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2022 | [[CHIPS Act]] passed | $52B semiconductors |
| 2022 | IRA critical minerals tax credits | Varies |
| **Feb 2026** | **[[Project Vault]] announced** | **$12B stockpile** |

**[[Project Vault]]:** $12B strategic minerals stockpile combining private funding with $10B [[EXIM Bank]] loan. First major government-backed mineral stockpile since Cold War.
