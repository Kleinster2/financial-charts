**Critical minerals** — Raw material inputs China dominates. Stronger leverage than US commodities — limited substitutes, years to build alternatives.

---

## China's dominance

| Mineral | China share | Use | Substitutes |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| [[Gallium]] | 99% refining | Semiconductors, 5G, radar | Very limited |
| [[Germanium]] | 60% refining | Fiber optics, IR, solar | Limited |
| [[Antimony]] | 48% | **Ammunition** (none), flame retardants | **None** |
| Graphite | 65% | EV batteries | Limited |
| Rare earths | 60%+ processing | Magnets, defense, EVs | Years to build |

**Bottom line:** China can inflict real pain. These aren't commodities with spot market substitutes.

## Rare earths

Separate from critical minerals but related:

| Stage | China share |
|-------|-------------|
| Mining | ~60% |
| Processing | ~90% |
| Magnet production | ~90% |

**Applications:** EV motors, wind turbines, defense (guidance, jets), electronics

See [[Rare earth leverage]], [[Rare earth elements]].

## Deployment history

| Date | Action | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| Aug 2023 | Gallium/germanium export controls | Response to US chip restrictions |
| Oct 2023 | Graphite export permits required | EV battery pressure |
| Dec 2025 | Ga/Ge controls suspended | Exchange for US Affiliate Rule suspension |
| — | Can escalate anytime | Trade war intensifies |

See [[China retaliatory toolkit]] for full countermeasure list.

## Why no substitutes?

| Mineral | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Gallium | No other country has refining capacity at scale |
| Germanium | Same — China built infrastructure over decades |
| Antimony | Literally no substitute for ammunition primers |
| Graphite | Alternative sources (Mozambique, Canada) years away |
| Rare earths | Processing expertise concentrated in China |

**US response:** DoD stockpiling, MP Materials expansion, but years behind.

## Investment implications

**If China restricts:**
- Non-China miners rally (MP Materials, Lynas, Perpetua Resources)
- Defense stocks at risk (supply chain exposure)
- EV cost inflation
- Battery recyclers gain (Redwood Materials, Li-Cycle)

**Key names:**
| Company | Mineral | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| MP Materials | Rare earths | US (California) |
| Lynas | Rare earths | Australia |
| Perpetua Resources | Antimony | US (Idaho) |
| Syrah Resources | Graphite | Mozambique |
