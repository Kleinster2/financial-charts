The capital stack behind AI buildout. Hyperscalers need $100Bs — private credit and PE are filling the gap.

**Deep dives:**

## Gigawatt economics

**Three different $-per-GW metrics — don't confuse them:**

| Metric | $/GW | What it means |
|--------|------|---------------|
| **Funding milestone** | ~$10B | Capital unlocked per GW deployed |
| **Revenue** | ~$10B | Current revenue generated per GW (may not scale) |
| **Build cost** | $12-50B | Actual cost to construct 1 GW |

### Why funding < build cost

If it costs ~$30B to build 1 GW but investors commit ~$10B per GW, where's the gap?

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Microsoft** | Azure credits, existing investment |
| **Revenue** | $20B ARR funds some capex |
| **Chip partner deals** | NVIDIA/AMD provide hardware at favorable terms |
| **[[AI infrastructure SPVs]]** | Sale-leasebacks, JVs |
| **Debt** | Bank financing, bonds |

**The $10B/GW milestone is just one layer.** Full builds use multiple capital sources.

### OpenAI capacity trajectory

| Year | Capacity | Revenue |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2023 | 0.2 GW | ~$2B |
| 2025 | 1.9 GW | $20B |
| Target | **26 GW** | ? |

**Critical question:** Does the 1:1 compute-revenue relationship hold at 10x+ scale?

## The financing gap

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 hyperscaler AI capex | ~$300B |
| 2026 projected | $620B |
| Morgan Stanley DC spend by 2028 | $3T |
| **Total external financing needed** | **$1.5T** |
| Private credit by 2028 | $800B |

**Problem:** Even hyperscalers don't want this on balance sheet. Enter private capital.

**UBS warning (Oct 2025):** "raises eyebrows for anyone that has seen credit cycles."

## Deal structures

| Structure | How it works | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **[[AI infrastructure SPVs]]** | PE takes 80%, hyperscaler leases back | Meta-Blue Owl $60B |
| **[[GPU-as-collateral]]** | GPUs secure debt, 11-14% rates | CoreWeave $7.5B |
| **Construction JV** | Bank finances build, long-term lease | Crusoe-JPMorgan $15B |
| **Chip vendor equity** | NVIDIA/AMD invest for supply lock | OpenAI-NVIDIA $100B |

See [[AI infrastructure deals]] for detailed capital stacks.

## Key players

### PE / Alternative managers

| Firm | AUM | AI infra exposure |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| [[Blue Owl]] | $273B | Meta $27B, Crusoe — **largest AI infra financier** |
| **Blackstone** | $1T+ | CoreWeave $7.5B lead |
| **Apollo** | $650B+ | Meta, xAI debt |
| **Brookfield** | $900B+ | Infrastructure focus |

### Debt investors

| Firm | Role |
|------|------|
| [[Pimco]] | $18B anchor in Meta SPV |
| [[BlackRock]] | $3B+ Meta, infrastructure fund |

### Banks

| Bank | Role |
|------|------|
| [[Morgan Stanley]] | SPV structuring (Meta, xAI) |
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | Construction loans (Crusoe $9.6B) |

## Risks

### The dot-com comparison

| Era | How financed | What happened |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| **Dot-com (2000)** | Equity | Burst had limited economic impact |
| **AI (2025)** | Debt (off-balance-sheet) | TBD — credit cycles hit harder |

**Off-balance-sheet history:**
- 2001: Enron — SPVs hid liabilities
- 2008: Banks moved mortgages off-balance-sheet
- 2025: Tech companies using SPVs for AI infrastructure

### Bank concentration risk

Banks becoming overexposed to few AI borrowers:
- [[Oracle]] CDS spike — lenders buying protection
- SRT exploration — Morgan Stanley considering offload

See [[Significant risk transfer]], [[AI infrastructure financing risk]].

## Investment implications

**Direct plays:**
- [[Blue Owl]] (OWL) — largest AI infra financier
- Blackstone (BX) — diversified, big DC exposure
- Data center REITs (EQIX, DLR)

**Indirect beneficiaries:**
- Power providers ([[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]])
- Hyperscalers preserving balance sheet flexibility

**Who loses:**
- Hyperscalers who can't access financing (weaker credit)
- Smaller AI companies competing for limited capital

## For theses

- [[AI hyperscalers]] — financing enables buildout
- [[Power constraints]] — capital alone isn't enough
- [[Long memory]], [[Long TSMC]] — financing enables chip demand
