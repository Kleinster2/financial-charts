The capital stack behind AI buildout. Hyperscalers need $100Bs — private credit and PE are filling the gap.

---

## The financing gap

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 hyperscaler AI capex | ~$300B |
| 2026 projected | $620B |
| Morgan Stanley DC spend by 2028 | $2.9T |
| Power infrastructure needed | $2.6T (44GW gap) |

**Problem:** Even hyperscalers don't want this on balance sheet. Enter private capital.

---

## Why off-balance-sheet?

**Hyperscaler motivations:**
- Preserve debt capacity for M&A
- Avoid earnings volatility from construction
- Share risk on massive capex
- Maintain credit ratings
- Focus on operations, not real estate

**Financier motivations:**
- Stable, long-term cash flows
- Hyperscaler credit quality
- Tangible collateral (GPUs, buildings)
- Infrastructure-like returns
- Growing market

---

## Deal structures

### Sale-leaseback
- Hyperscaler sells data center to PE
- Leases it back long-term
- Gets cash, removes asset from balance sheet
- PE gets stable rental income

### Joint ventures
- PE finances construction (60-80%)
- Hyperscaler operates and anchors capacity
- Shared ownership
- Example: Meta-Blue Owl Hyperion (80/20)

### GPU financing
- Lender finances GPU purchases
- GPUs serve as collateral
- 75% of AI cloud spend = GPUs
- Hardware retains value 3-5 years

### Construction financing
- Banks/PE fund data center construction
- Take-out financing upon completion
- Example: JPMorgan $2.3B for Crusoe

## Key players

### Private equity / Alternative asset managers

| Firm | AUM | AI infra exposure |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| [[Blue Owl]] | $273B | $34B digital infra, Meta $27B deal |
| **Blackstone** | $1T+ | QTS acquisition, major DC portfolio |
| **KKR** | $550B+ | Infrastructure, data centers |
| **Brookfield** | $900B+ | Infrastructure focus |
| **DigitalBridge** | $80B+ | Pure-play digital infra |
| **Apollo** | $650B+ | Growing DC exposure |

### Data center REITs

| REIT | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Equinix (EQIX) | Colocation, interconnection |
| Digital Realty (DLR) | Wholesale, hyperscale |
| QTS (Blackstone) | Private, hyperscale |

### Banks (construction/bridge)

- JPMorgan — Crusoe $2.3B
- Goldman Sachs
- Morgan Stanley
- Bank of America

## Major deals (2024-2025)

| Deal | Size | Structure | Parties |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Meta Hyperion** | $27B | JV (80/20) | Blue Owl, Meta |
| **Crusoe Abilene** | $15B | JV | Blue Owl, Crusoe |
| **CoreWeave** | $7.5B | Debt | Blackstone, others |
| **xAI Colossus** | Multiple | Various | Multiple lenders |
| **Oracle Michigan** | ~$10B | Fell through | Blue Owl pulled out |

---

## GPU-as-collateral thesis

**Why GPUs work as collateral:**
- 75% of AI cloud spend → GPUs
- Retain value for 3-5 years
- Liquid secondary market developing
- Known depreciation curve (unlike software)
- Hyperscaler demand = price floor

**Risks:**
- Technology obsolescence (Blackwell → Rubin)
- Demand cycle could turn
- Resale market still maturing

---

## Risks for financiers

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Demand cycle** | Long-term hyperscaler contracts |
| **Technology obsolescence** | Short financing terms, residual buffers |
| **Construction delays** | Experienced developers, milestone funding |
| **Power availability** | Site selection, [[Power constraints]] due diligence |
| **Interest rates** | Floating rate pass-through, hedging |
| **Concentration** | Diversification across hyperscalers |

---

## Oracle deal collapse — lessons

**Blue Owl pulled out of ~$10B Oracle Michigan deal:**
- Concerns over Oracle's rising debt
- AI spending aggressive vs balance sheet
- Shows financier discipline
- Not all deals get done

**Implication:** Credit quality matters. PE won't finance everyone.

---

## Investment implications

**Direct plays:**
- [[Blue Owl]] (OWL) — largest AI infra financier
- Blackstone (BX) — diversified but big DC exposure
- DigitalBridge (DBRG) — pure-play digital infra
- Data center REITs (EQIX, DLR)

**Indirect beneficiaries:**
- Hyperscalers with off-balance-sheet capacity
- Construction/engineering firms
- Power providers ([[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]])

**Who loses:**
- Hyperscalers who can't access financing (weaker credit)
- Smaller AI companies competing for limited capital

---

## For theses

**Cross-cutting:**
- [[AI hyperscalers]] — financing enables buildout
- [[Power constraints]] — capital alone isn't enough, need power
- [[Long memory]], [[Long TSMC]] — financing enables GPU/chip demand

**New angle:** Long PE/alternative managers as AI infrastructure enablers
