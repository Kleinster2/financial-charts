The echo chamber dynamics of San Francisco AI culture.

## The bubble

SF AI community operates in intense feedback loop: convince each other breakthroughs are imminent → work extremely hard → sometimes make breakthroughs real. Steve Jobs reality distortion field at scale.

This is productive but risky. Deviation from reality can lead to missing perspectives outside the bubble.

## The memes

**"Permanent underclass"** — meme that last six months of 2025 was only time to build durable AI startup value. After that, all value captured by existing companies and you're poor.

Example of SF thing going "so far" — detached from broader reality.

## The productivity bubble vs financial bubble

Burn Hobart classification:
- **Financial bubbles** — speculation, bad
- **Build-out bubbles** — pushes people to build, good

AI currently in build-out bubble. Risk is transitioning to financial bubble as valuations detach from fundamentals.

## Getting out

People in the bubble need to:
- Read history, literature
- Visit other places
- Talk to people outside SF
- Understand perspectives beyond Twitter/Substack

Being physically in SF is valuable for impact. But has trade-offs.

## Big Tech reputation problem

Timing is unfortunate: Big Tech reputation at historic low just as AI (inevitably Big Tech) emerges. Hard communication environment.

Would be valuable to talk to people who hate Big Tech and see AI as continuation of that.
