# Northwest Passage

Arctic shipping route through Canada's Arctic Archipelago, connecting Atlantic to Pacific. Currently not commercially viable, but sovereignty disputes could matter as ice melts.

## Geography

Runs through the islands of northern Canada:
- **East**: Baffin Bay / Davis Strait (Atlantic)
- **West**: Beaufort Sea → Bering Strait (Pacific)

Multiple possible routes through the archipelago — no single defined channel like Suez or Panama.

## Why It's Not Viable (Today)

| Challenge | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Shallow waters | Limits vessel size |
| Tight channels | Difficult navigation |
| Limited infrastructure | No ports, rescue, refueling |
| Ice unpredictability | Less reliable than [[Northern Sea Route]] |
| Sovereignty disputes | Legal uncertainty |

China studies it but does not plan around it — all Arctic focus is on Russia's NSR.

## Sovereignty Dispute

**Canada's position:** Internal waters — full sovereignty, right to regulate all traffic.

**US/EU position:** International strait — right of transit passage under UNCLOS.

| Implication | If Canada wins | If international |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Traffic control | Canada regulates | Free transit |
| Fees/permits | Canada can charge | Limited ability |
| Environmental rules | Canada sets | International standards |
| Military transit | Canada can restrict | Free passage |

Dispute is dormant while route is ice-blocked. If climate change opens it, expect legal confrontation.

## Climate Outlook

Arctic ice declining ~40% from 1980s. Northwest Passage becoming navigable for longer periods each summer, but still far behind NSR in reliability.

If warming continues:
- 2030s–2040s: Possibly seasonal commercial use
- Long-term: Could rival NSR for some Pacific-Atlantic routes

## Strategic Implications

**For Canada:**
- Sovereignty assertion becoming more urgent
- Need for Arctic infrastructure investment
- Coast Guard / military presence questions

**For US:**
- Wants international strait status (naval freedom)
- NORAD/Arctic defense implications

**For China:**
- Watches but doesn't invest (yet)
- Would prefer international status for access
- Focus remains on Russia partnership via NSR

## Investment Angle

**Not investable today** — no commercial traffic to speak of.

**Watch for:**
- Canada infrastructure announcements
- Ice extent trends
- Sovereignty legal developments
- Any major transit attempts
