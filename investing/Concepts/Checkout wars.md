**Checkout wars** — The competitive battle for who owns the checkout button in e-commerce. Distinct from [[Payments Networks]] (Visa/Mastercard) which process transactions — this is about who captures the customer at the moment of purchase.

---

## Why it matters

The checkout button determines:
- **Customer ownership** — Who has the relationship, data, repeat business
- **Conversion rates** — 70%+ of carts abandoned, friction kills sales
- **Take rates** — Checkout owner captures 1-3% of transaction
- **Network effects** — More users = more merchants accept = more users

The winner of checkout wars captures the customer relationship that [[Visa]] and [[Mastercard]] merely process.

| Player | Users | Volume/Share | Growth | Conversion lift |

## Who's winning

**Winners:**
- **[[Shop Pay]]** — 57% YoY growth, 200M users, highest conversion for repeat customers
- **[[Apple Pay]]** — Surpassing PayPal in US online volumes, dominant on iOS (60% of consumers)

**Losers:**
- **[[PayPal]]** — Branded checkout growth collapsed to 1% in Q4 2025, losing share to faster alternatives

## Why PayPal is losing

Q4 2025 earnings revealed the problem (stock -15%):

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Friction** | Extra login step vs biometric/one-click |
| **Mobile disadvantage** | Apple Pay native on iOS, Shop Pay pre-saved |
| **Younger users** | Prefer Apple Pay, Shop Pay over legacy PayPal |
| **Merchant adoption** | New checkout options added faster |

Management blamed "macro" and "K-shaped economy" but analysts see structural share loss. New CEO (Enrique Lores from HP) effective March 2026 — turnaround attempt.

## Conversion rates matter

| Checkout | Conversion lift | Speed |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| [[Shop Pay]] (returning) | **+36%** | Pre-saved everything |
| [[Apple Pay]] | **+22%** | Face ID, one tap |
| [[Stripe]] Link (returning) | **+14%** | 6 seconds, 3x faster |
| [[PayPal]] | Lower | Extra login step |

**Key insight:** 51% of shoppers choose where to shop based on checkout ease. 84% want one-click checkout. 61% abandon carts if preferred payment missing.

---

## Mobile vs desktop

Mobile e-commerce now >60% of traffic. This favors:
- **[[Apple Pay]]** — Native iOS integration, Face ID
- **[[Shop Pay]]** — Mobile-optimized, app ecosystem
- **[[Google]] Pay** — Android native

**PayPal disadvantage:** Requires app switch or login — friction on mobile.

---

## Investment implications

| Thesis | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| **Avoid PYPL** | Structural share loss, not cyclical |
| **Long SHOP** | Shop Pay driving take rate expansion |
| **Apple ecosystem** | Apple Pay strengthens iPhone lock-in |
| **Stripe private** | Link growth; watch for IPO |

**PayPal's challenge:** Must innovate faster checkout or watch branded volume erode. Braintree (unbranded processing) growing but lower margin.

## Key metrics to watch

- PayPal branded checkout growth (was 1% Q4 2025)
- Shop Pay GMV and Shopify attach rate (was 38%)
- Apple Pay online volume estimates
- Checkout button placement wars at major merchants
