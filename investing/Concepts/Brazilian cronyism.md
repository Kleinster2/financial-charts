**Brazilian cronyism** — "Capitalismo de compadrio." State contracts, development bank lending, political donations, and regulatory capture create persistent extraction cycles across administrations. Not limited to any one scandal.

---

## The pattern

```
State resources (contracts, loans, subsidies, jobs)
    → Flow to politically connected firms/individuals
        → Recipients fund political campaigns (legal + caixa 2)
            → Politicians appoint boards, shape regulation
                → More state resources flow...
```

**Distinctive features:**
- Democratic system — elections happen, power rotates
- Strong investigative institutions (MPF, Federal Police) — scandals get exposed
- Weak follow-through — convictions reversed, reforms diluted
- Centrist bloc ("Centrão") brokers patronage across administrations

## Major scandals

### [[Lava Jato]] (2014-2021)

The big one. Petrobras contracts, construction cartel, BNDES "national champions."

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Convictions | 174 |
| Recovered | R$14.3B |
| Odebrecht settlement | $2.6B |
| Presidents implicated | Lula, Temer |

**Vehicles:** State banks (BNDES, Caixa, BB), pension funds, FI-FGTS.

**Outcome:** Task force dissolved (2021), key convictions annulled, Lula returned to presidency.

See [[Lava Jato]] for full detail on banking scandals.

### Mensalão (2005)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scheme | Monthly payments to congressional allies |
| Vehicle | Banco do Brasil marketing contracts |
| Convicted | José Dirceu (PT chief of staff), others |
| Outcome | Supreme Court convictions — rare success |

Precursor to Lava Jato. Showed PT used state bank contracts for patronage. Unlike Lava Jato, convictions mostly stuck.

---

### Orçamento secreto (2020-present)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mechanism | Congressional earmarks with no transparency |
| Scale | R$16-19B/year |
| Beneficiaries | "Centrão" congressmen |
| Legal status | Ruled unconstitutional (2022), continues modified |

**How it works:**
- Constitutional amendment allowed "relator amendments" (rapporteur earmarks)
- Individual congressmen direct spending without disclosure
- Funds go to allied mayors, contractors, NGOs
- Vote-buying with public money

**Why it matters:** Post-Lava Jato, patronage shifted from executive (Petrobras, BNDES) to legislature. Same extraction, different vehicle.

---

### COVID vaccine scandals (2021)

| Scandal | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Covaxin** | Indian vaccine at 1000% markup, kickbacks alleged |
| **Pfizer delays** | Government slow to negotiate, intermediaries sought bribes |
| **Davati** | Middlemen sought $1/dose kickback |

Congressional investigation (CPI) exposed but no major convictions.

---

### 1990s privatizations

| Company | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **Vale** | Sold at allegedly low price; political connections of buyers |
| **Telebrás** | Connected buyers, regulatory capture (see Daniel Dantas below) |

Privatization was necessary but process had crony elements — connected buyers, questionable pricing. Political family banks (Econômico, Nacional, Bamerindus) also collapsed in this era — see Private bank failures section below.

---

### Banestado (2003)

- Paraná state bank used for money laundering
- $30B+ moved offshore via CC-5 accounts
- Doleiros (money changers) — same players later in Lava Jato
- Exposed the underground financial plumbing

---

## Private bank failures

Surviving private banks (Itaú, Bradesco) weren't in major scandals — they benefit from [[Banking concentration]]. But historically, politically-connected private banks failed spectacularly. Classic [[Bank cronyism]] pattern.

### [[Banco Master]] (2025) — most recent

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Owner | Daniel Vorcaro |
| Scheme | High-yield CDBs (140%+ CDI), state bank (BRB) bailout attempt |
| FGC payout | R$41B — largest ever |
| Depositors | 1.6 million |
| Outcome | Liquidated Nov 2025; Vorcaro arrested fleeing to Malta |

BRB (state bank of Federal District) injected R$16.7B into Master before Central Bank blocked acquisition. Supreme Court justices entangled — Toffoli traveled with Vorcaro's lawyer, Moraes contacted CB president. IMF/World Bank raised concerns about politicization.

### Political family banks (1990s)

| Bank | Owner/Family | Political connection | Collapse |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Banco Econômico** (1995) | Angelo Calmon de Sá | Bahia oligarch, senator | Bad loans to allies, CB intervention |
| **Banco Nacional** (1995) | Magalhães Pinto family | Minas Gerais political dynasty | Fictitious assets, merged into Unibanco |
| **Bamerindus** (1997) | José Eduardo Andrade Vieira | Senator, Agriculture Minister | Loans to political allies, sold to HSBC |

**Pattern:** Regional political families got banking licenses, lent to themselves and allies, collapsed when Real Plan stabilization exposed bad assets. Central Bank absorbed losses. Same pattern as [[Ayandeh Bank]] in Iran.

### Private bank frauds (2000s-2010s)

| Bank | Year | Scheme | Outcome |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **Banco Santos** | 2004 | Fraud, money laundering, political loans | Liquidated; Edemar Cid Ferreira jailed |
| **Banco Panamericano** | 2010 | R$4.3B accounting hole | Rescued by Caixa/FGC, sold to BTG |
| **Banco Cruzeiro do Sul** | 2012 | Payroll lending fraud, inflated portfolio | CB intervention, liquidated |
| **Banco BVA** | 2012 | Fraud, bad loans | CB intervention |

**Banco Santos** — Edemar Cid Ferreira ran a fraud scheme while cultivating political connections and amassing a famous art collection (later seized). Classic crony banker.

**Banco Panamericano** — Owned by Silvio Santos (media mogul). Accounting fraud hid R$4.3B in losses. FGC (deposit insurance) + Caixa bailed it out to protect depositors. Silvio's media empire bought political goodwill — bank got rescued rather than liquidated.

### Marka/FonteCindam (1999)

- Real devaluation crisis
- Salvatore Cacciola allegedly got insider info on currency move
- Central Bank provided emergency liquidity (controversial)
- Cacciola fled to Italy, later extradited
- Scandal over whether CB officials tipped off connected bankers

### Daniel Dantas / Opportunity

- Not a bank — asset manager / private equity
- Brasil Telecom privatization — accused of bribing regulators
- Arrested multiple times (2008), charges eventually dropped
- Epitomized 1990s privatization cronyism

## Structural cronyism (ongoing)

Not scandal-specific — baked into the system.

### Crédito rural (agricultural subsidies)

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Mechanism | Below-market loans to agriculture |
| Scale | R$300B+/year |
| Problem | Large agribusiness benefits disproportionately |
| Politics | Rural caucus ("bancada ruralista") protects subsidies |

### Public sector privileges

| Group | Privilege |
|-------|-----------|
| **Judiciary** | Self-set pay, "auxílios" (housing, food, etc.) exceed salary caps |
| **Prosecutors** | Same privileges, independence from accountability |
| **Military** | Pension rules, retirement benefits |
| **Civil servants** | Job stability, wage floors |

Not corruption per se — but legal extraction via captured institutions.

### Zona Franca de Manaus

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mechanism | Tax-free manufacturing zone in Amazon |
| Beneficiaries | Electronics assemblers (often foreign) |
| Cost | R$25B+/year in foregone taxes |
| Politics | Amazon caucus protects; any reform blocked |

Originally 1967 military-era policy. Persists because beneficiaries fund politicians.

### Rouanet Law (cultural funding)

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Mechanism | Tax incentives for cultural sponsorship |
| Abuse | Funds flow to connected artists, festivals |
| Scale | Billions in tax credits |
| Politics | Cultural establishment defends |

Legitimate arts funding mixed with patronage.

## State-level cronyism

### Rio de Janeiro

| Figure | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Sergio Cabral** | Governor 2007-2014; 300+ years in sentences |
| **Anthony Garotinho** | Governor 1999-2002; multiple arrests |
| **Witzel** | Governor 2019-2021; impeached |

Rio is particularly captured — organized crime, militia, political corruption intertwined.

### Other states

| State | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| **Minas Gerais** | Traditional oligarchy politics |
| **Bahia** | ACM dynasty (Antônio Carlos Magalhães) |
| **Maranhão** | Sarney family dominance |
| **Alagoas** | Collor family (impeached president) |

Regional dynasties persist despite federal scandals.

---

## Why it persists

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Fragmented politics** | 20+ parties, coalition government requires patronage |
| **Centrão** | Center bloc brokers support for any president |
| **Weak parties** | Politicians switch parties; loyalty is transactional |
| **Electoral costs** | Campaigns expensive; donors expect returns |
| **Institutional capture** | Judiciary, prosecutors can be pressured |
| **Short memory** | Voters re-elect convicted politicians |

**The Lava Jato lesson:** Even successful investigations can be reversed when they threaten too many interests.

---

## Investment implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **State-connected companies** | Petrobras, BNDES beneficiaries carry political risk |
| **Regime change** | Both crackdown AND reversal of crackdown possible |
| **Infrastructure** | Bid-rigging risk on large projects |
| **Regulatory** | Agencies can be captured |
| **Private sector** | Less exposed (see [[Banking concentration]]) |

**Due diligence:**
- Who are the company's government relationships?
- Does revenue depend on state contracts?
- How did they get licenses/concessions?
