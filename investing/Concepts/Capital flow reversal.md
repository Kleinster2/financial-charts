**Capital flow reversal** — US drawing capital in, China pushing capital out. First time China outbound FDI exceeded US (H1 2025). Fundamental reshaping of global economic relationships.

## The reversal

**H1 2025 milestone:**

| Metric | US | China |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Share of global outbound FDI | <10% | **10%** |
| Share of global inbound FDI | **20%** | — |

*Source: OECD*

**EU down 45%** in inbound investment vs 6 months earlier.

**Ana Novik (OECD):** "This world is changing fast."

## Historical context

| Era | US Role | China Role |
|-----|---------|------------|
| 1945-2000 | Capital exporter, factory builder | Closed economy |
| 2000-2020 | Consumer market, importer | Factory to the world |
| 2020-2025 | Reshoring, tariffs | Trophy asset buyer |
| **2025+** | **Capital importer** | **Greenfield builder** |

## China outbound surge

**2025 record year:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Announced outbound | $106.6B (Q1-Q3) |
| Greenfield share | **85%** |
| Largest deal | ByteDance $38B Brazil DC |

**Shift:** From buying trophy assets (Waldorf Astoria) to building new factories.

**Funding source:** Trade surplus no longer recycled into US Treasuries → funding overseas expansion via state banks.

**Brad Setser (CFR):** "You can clearly draw a pretty straight line between the shift in China's recycling away from foreign exchange reserves towards the state banks and increased funding for the outward expansion of Chinese companies."

## China outbound by destination (Q3 2025)

**Top 25 pledged investments (Rhodium):**

| Country | Amount | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Indonesia** | **$10.3B** | Batteries, nickel, chemicals |
| **Thailand** | **$9.0B** | Data centers, manufacturing |
| **Brazil** | **$4.8B** | ByteDance DC |
| **Nigeria** | **$4.0B** | Gas city |
| **Zimbabwe** | **$2.8B** | Resources |
| **Egypt** | **$2.7B** | — |
| **UK** | **$2.0B** | — |
| **Argentina** | **$2.0B** | — |

**Over 1/3** of China's largest investments went to Indonesia and Thailand.

## Major Chinese greenfield projects (2025)

| Project | Value | Location | Company |

| **Manufacturing** | **$10B** | Mitsubishi $4B |
| **Other** | **$3B** | Capital Power $2B |

**Reality check:** Manufacturing job rebound not yet materializing.

## Regional impacts

### Europe

**CATL vs Ford in Germany:**
- CATL Arnstadt: 2,000 German jobs, growing
- Ford Cologne: Cutting 1,000 jobs, single shift

**Macron to Xi (Dec 2025):** Urging more Chinese investment to "rebalance" relationship.

**EU Trade Commissioner Sefcovic:** "We welcome the investments, if you are talking about real investments" with jobs, IP sharing.

### Southeast Asia

**China dominant:**
- Thailand: ByteDance data centers
- Indonesia: CATL battery plant, GAC EV assembly, nickel refining
- Chinese payment systems widely used

**Lawrence Wong (Singapore PM):** "America's actions... has impacted America's standing in Southeast Asia."

**Dan Wang (Eurasia Group):** Chinese companies "cannot make money at home. The China market is too depressed."

See [[China economic transition]] — traditional economy lost 5pp of GDP (2023-2025), new industries gained <1pp.

### Mexico

**Caught in the middle:**
- Economy contracting
- US investment paused pending Trump tariff clarity
- Cracking down on Chinese investment to appease Trump
- 50% tariffs on 1,400 Asian products (Jan 1, 2026)
- "Plan Mexico" incentives stalling

**Alberto Ramos (Goldman):** "If the US wants home shoring... that's more problematic for Mexico."

### Africa

**Chinese shift:** From resource extraction to market access
- Building EV factories in Morocco (EU export)
- $20B Nigeria gas city
- DRC/Angola copper expansion

**Yunnan Chen (ODI Global):** Chinese firms "see African economies with growing middle-class markets as opportunities, and they're more willing to take risks."

## Corporate adaptations

**DHL:** Deploying Chinese-speaking staff globally to capture business from Chinese investors. Same model used for Japan/Korea in 1980s.

**John Pearson (DHL Express CEO):** "We want to be there to meet them off the plane."

**DHL's 20 "geographic tailwind" economies:** Markets seeing burst of new factory, supply chain, and logistics investments — includes Mexico, Brazil, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East, parts of Africa.

**Ford:** Partnering with Renault for European EVs rather than competing alone against Chinese.

**Jim Farley (Ford CEO):** "We know we're in a fight for our lives in our industry."

---

## Geely/Volvo — the template

**Sweden since 2010:**
- Geely bought Volvo Cars
- Still ~20,000 Swedish employees
- New battery plant = 3,000 more jobs
- IP stayed in Sweden (fears proved unfounded)

**But:** Sweden now tighter on FDI screening. PTL $1.4B factory cancelled.

**Bjorn Jerden (Swedish Institute):** "On the whole, you can describe it as a success story."

---

## Investment implications

**Long China outbound beneficiaries:**
- Southeast Asian infrastructure
- European EV supply chain
- African resources/manufacturing

**Long US inbound beneficiaries:**
- AI infrastructure
- Pharma manufacturing
- Industrial REITs

**At risk:**
- Mexico (caught between US and China)
- European automakers (Chinese competition)
- US companies with global footprints

## Jay Shambaugh (ex-Biden admin)

> "China is morphing from your biggest problem in terms of jobs to being potentially an employer in your country. And that's a radical shift."

> "It's like we view everything as transactional and we are going to try to take as much as possible from them."
