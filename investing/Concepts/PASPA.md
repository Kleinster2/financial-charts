PASPA -- The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal law that effectively banned sports betting nationwide except in Nevada (with narrow exemptions for Delaware, Oregon, and Montana). Struck down by the Supreme Court on May 14, 2018, in Murphy v. NCAA (7-2), ruling that PASPA unconstitutionally commandeered state regulatory power. The repeal opened the door for state-by-state sports betting legalization.
