**GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)** — the standard accounting framework for US public companies. Set by FASB. SEC requires GAAP financials in all filings. International equivalent: IFRS.

## GAAP vs non-GAAP

| Dimension | GAAP | Non-GAAP (adjusted) |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| Authority | FASB / SEC mandated | Company-defined |
| Comparability | Standardized across firms | Varies by company |
| Includes | Stock-based comp, restructuring, impairments | Typically excludes these |
| Required in filings | Yes (10-K, 10-Q) | Optional (earnings releases) |
| Investor preference | Value investors, credit analysts | Growth investors, sell-side |

**Why it matters:** Non-GAAP EPS often 20-50% higher than GAAP EPS for tech companies due to stock-based compensation (SBC) exclusion. The gap itself is informative — a widening GAAP/non-GAAP spread signals rising SBC dilution.

## Common non-GAAP adjustments

| Adjustment | Rationale | Criticism |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Stock-based compensation | "Non-cash" | Real dilution to shareholders |
| Amortization of intangibles | Acquisition accounting noise | Ignores asset consumption |
| Restructuring charges | "One-time" | Often recurring |
| Impairments | Non-operational | Reflects real value destruction |
| Litigation reserves | Irregular | Part of business risk |

## GAAP vs IFRS

| Feature | US GAAP | IFRS |
|---------|---------|------|
| Standard setter | FASB | IASB |
| Used by | US public companies | ~140 countries |
| Approach | Rules-based | Principles-based |
| Revenue recognition | ASC 606 | IFRS 15 (largely converged) |
| Inventory | LIFO allowed | LIFO prohibited |
| R&D | Expense as incurred | Capitalize development phase |
| Lease accounting | ASC 842 | IFRS 16 (largely converged) |

**Vault context:** Most actor notes cover US-listed companies (GAAP). European names ([[ASML]], [[SAP]]) and non-US filers use IFRS. Cross-border comparisons require awareness of these differences.

| **Goodwill impairment** | Acquisition-heavy companies ([[Oracle]], [[Intel]]) |
| **Revenue recognition (ASC 606)** | SaaS companies, multi-element arrangements |
