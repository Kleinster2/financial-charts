AI chip supply chain has multiple bottlenecks beyond just foundry capacity.

## The stack of constraints

| Layer | Bottleneck | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Power** | 44GW US shortfall | Hard constraint, no solution in sight |
| **Materials** | InP substrates for optical | Shortage widening through 2026+ |
| **Foundry** | TSMC sub-3nm capacity | Tight, annual price hikes |
| **Packaging** | CoWoS | Tight, alternatives emerging (Intel EMIB, SK Hynix) |
| **Memory** | HBM | Shortage through CY26, fully contracted |
| **Test** | Final test for large packages | Hidden bottleneck, equipment lag |

## Key insight

Even if one layer loosens, others constrain. "Solving" fab capacity doesn't help if:
- Power isn't available
- Packaging is full
- HBM is allocated
- Materials are short

**Bottlenecks cascade and shift** — watch for which one becomes binding.

## Materials layer (emerging)

InP (Indium Phosphide) substrates for optical interconnects:
- Supply: Sumitomo (Japan), AXT (US but China manufacturing)
- Demand: AI data center optical interconnects
- Gap widening, 20-30% capacity increases not enough
- China export controls on gallium/germanium/InP materials
- Workarounds: recycled wafers, customer-supplied substrates
