# Lien Priority

**Who has first claim on collateral** — a lien is a legal right to seize and sell specific assets if a borrower defaults. Lien priority determines which creditor gets paid first from those assets.

---

## The hierarchy

```
Collateral (e.g., real estate, inventory, equipment)
    ↓
First Lien — paid first from collateral proceeds
    ↓
Second Lien — paid after first lien satisfied
    ↓
Third Lien — paid after second lien (rare)
    ↓
Unsecured — no specific collateral claim
```

**Key principle:** Higher lien = better recovery in distress. First lien holders often recover 70-100%; unsecured may get pennies.

## Types of liens

| Lien type | Collateral | Typical use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **First lien term loan** | All assets | Senior secured financing |
| **ABL (asset-based loan)** | Inventory, receivables | Working capital |
| **Real estate mortgage** | Specific property | Property-backed debt |
| **Second lien** | Same assets, junior position | Higher yield, higher risk |
| **Unsecured** | None (general claim) | Bonds, trade payables |

## First lien vs. second lien

| Characteristic | First Lien | Second Lien |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Priority | Paid first | Paid after first lien |
| Recovery (typical) | 70-100% | 20-50% |
| Interest rate | Lower | Higher (compensates for risk) |
| Covenants | Tighter | Often follows first lien |
| Control in distress | Usually drives process | Along for the ride |

**Intercreditor agreement:** First and second lien holders sign an agreement governing their rights — who can enforce, when, and how proceeds are split.

## Within the same lien: First Out / Second Out

Even creditors with the **same lien** can have different payment priority:

| Position | Priority |
|----------|----------|
| First Out (1O) | Paid first within the lien |
| Second Out (2O) | Paid after 1O |
| Third Out (3O) | Paid after 2O |
| Last Out (LO) | Paid last within the lien |

This creates a [[Payment waterfall]] within a single lien class.

**Common in:** ABL facilities, distressed exchanges, unitranche loans

## Case study: [[Saks Global]]

[[Saks bankruptcy]] shows multiple lien levels:

| Position | Instrument | Amount | Collateral |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| **ABL (First Lien)** | Revolving facility | $442M | Inventory, receivables |
| **First Lien 1O** | SPV Notes (SGUS) | $762M | All assets |
| **First Lien 2O** | Second Out Notes | $1.4B | All assets (junior to 1O) |
| **First Lien 3O** | Third Out Notes | $441M | All assets (junior to 2O) |
| **Unsecured** | Old notes, vendors | ~$500M+ | None |
| **Equity** | [[Amazon]], [[Salesforce]] | $475M+ | None |

The [[611 Fifth Avenue]] flagship was specifically carved out — pledged for [[DIP financing]], priming existing liens.

## Priming liens

In bankruptcy, new lenders can get a **priming lien** — jumping ahead of existing secured creditors:

```
Before bankruptcy:
    First Lien → Collateral

After DIP approved:
    DIP Lien (priming) → Collateral
        ↓
    First Lien → Collateral (now second)
```

**Why courts allow it:** Without DIP financing, company liquidates — everyone gets less. Existing creditors are "primed" but compensated with adequate protection.

**Saks example:** DIP lenders got priming lien on flagship, jumping ahead of existing bondholders.

---

## Collateral coverage

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Loan-to-value (LTV)** | Debt ÷ Collateral value |
| **Overcollateralized** | Collateral > Debt (safer) |
| **Undercollateralized** | Collateral < Debt (risky) |

**In distress:** If collateral value drops below first lien debt, second lien and unsecured get nothing.

## Investment implications

**For credit investors:**
- Lien position is primary recovery driver
- First lien ≠ guaranteed recovery (Saks 1O lost 75%)
- Understand the intercreditor agreement
- Watch for lien subordination in distress

**For equity:**
- All liens sit above equity
- Even preferred equity is below unsecured debt
- Secured creditors control distressed process

**Due diligence:**
- What assets are pledged?
- What's the LTV?
- Who has intercreditor control?
- Can new debt prime existing liens?
