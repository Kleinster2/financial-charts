# Battery Recycling

Recovery of critical minerals from end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scrap. Key to reducing [[China]] dependence and closing the battery supply chain loop.

---

## Why recycling matters

| Driver | Dynamic |
|--------|---------|
| **Critical minerals** | Recover lithium, cobalt, nickel without new mining |
| **[[China]] dependence** | Domestic recycling = less reliance on Chinese refining |
| **IRA incentives** | Tax credits for domestic content |
| **Sustainability** | [[ESG]] pressure, OEM commitments |
| **Cost** | Recycled materials cheaper than virgin (at scale) |

## Key players

| Company | Status | Backers/Partners | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **[[Redwood Materials]]** | Leader | JB Straubel ([[Tesla]] co-founder), $2B+ raised | Nevada gigafactory, [[Panasonic]]/[[Toyota]] deals |
| **Li-Cycle** | Public (LICY) | Glencore partnership | Spoke-and-hub model, Rochester hub |
| **[[Ascend]] Elements** | Growing | [[SK On]] partnership | Hydro-to-cathode process |
| **Cirba Solutions** | Private | Koch, Jaguar | Largest US collector |
| **Battery Resources** | [[EU]]-focused | — | Belgian operations |

## [[Redwood Materials]]

**Dominant US player:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Founder | JB Straubel ([[Tesla]] CTO 2004-2019) |
| Total raised | $2B+ |
| Valuation | ~$5B (2023) |
| Capacity | 100 GWh/year target |
| Location | Nevada (near [[Tesla]] Gigafactory) |

**Key partnerships:**
- [[Panasonic]] — cathode supply deal
- [[Toyota]] — battery recycling partnership
- [[Ford]] — recycling agreement
- [[Volkswagen]] — strategic partnership

**Vertical integration:** Recycling → anode/cathode production → back to cell makers

## Recycling process

```
Collection → Shredding → Black mass → Hydromet/Pyromet → Refined materials
                                            ↓
                              Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, [[Copper]]
                                            ↓
                              Cathode/Anode precursors
```

| Method | Process | Recovery rate | Players |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Hydrometallurgical** | Chemical leaching | 95%+ | Redwood, Li-Cycle |
| **Pyrometallurgical** | Smelting | 70-80% | Umicore |
| **Direct recycling** | Preserve cathode structure | Highest | Early stage |

## Feedstock sources

| Source | Volume | Timing |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Manufacturing scrap** | High now | Immediate |
| **[[Consumer]] electronics** | Moderate | Ongoing |
| **EV batteries** | Growing | Wave coming 2027+ |

**EV battery wave:** First mass-market EVs (2017-2020) hitting end of life 2027-2030. Massive feedstock increase.

---

## Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Black mass value | $5-15/kg (varies with commodity prices) |
| Lithium recovery cost | Lower than mining (at scale) |
| Cobalt recovery | 95%+ from hydro process |
| IRA benefit | Domestic content = tax credit eligibility |

---

## Investment dynamics

**Bull case:**
- EV battery wave 2027+ = feedstock surge
- IRA domestic content requirements
- OEMs need recycling for [[ESG]]
- Redwood vertical integration moat

**Bear case:**
- Commodity price volatility (lithium crashed 2023)
- Li-Cycle struggles (scaled too fast)
- [[China]] dominates globally
- Direct recycling could disrupt
