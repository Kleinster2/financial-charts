#concept #media #business-model

Reporter-owned media — journalism outlets where the reporters who produce the work own the business. No outside investors, no corporate parent, no board of non-journalists calling editorial shots. Revenue comes from reader subscriptions, not advertising or VC growth mandates.

## Why it matters

Nearly every outlet in this movement was born from a specific corporate media failure — a bankruptcy, a hedge fund acquisition, a PE-driven editorial mandate, or mass layoffs. The model is not abstract ideology; it's a pragmatic response to repeated institutional betrayal.

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| VC-funded collapse | [[Vice Media]] → [[404 Media]] |
| PE editorial interference | G/O Media (Deadspin) → [[Defector Media]] |
| Hedge fund gutting | Alden Global (Denver Post) → Colorado Sun |
| Publisher shutdown | Star Tribune (City Pages) → Racket |
| Corporate instability | Kotaku → Aftermath |
| Union retaliation | Long Beach Post → Long Beach Watchdog |

## The VC-funded contrast

The model these outlets reject:

| Company | VC raised | Peak valuation | Outcome |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| [[Vice Media]] | $450M+ (TPG alone) | $5.7B (2017) | Bankruptcy May 2023, sold for $350M |
| BuzzFeed | ~$500M | $1.7B (2016) | Shuttered BuzzFeed News (2023), repeated layoffs |
| Mic | ~$60M | N/A | Fire-sold to Bustle Digital Group |

Root cause: Google and [[Meta]] captured digital ad revenue, social referral traffic collapsed, and media companies could never generate the exponential growth curves VC returns require. Media companies announced 21,000+ job cuts in 2023 alone — a 467% increase from the prior year.

## The landscape

| Outlet | Founded | Origin | Paid subscribers | Revenue | Profitable |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| [[Defector Media]] | Sep 2020 | Ex-Deadspin | ~40,000 | $4.6M (FY2024) | Yes (every year) |
| [[404 Media]] | Aug 2023 | Ex-Motherboard | ~11,000 | Not disclosed | Yes (since month 6) |
| Hell Gate | Jul 2022 | Ex-Village Voice/Gothamist | 9,000 | ~$850K (2025 proj) | Yes (Nov 2025) |
| The Lever | 2020 | David Sirota | 112K free+paid | Not disclosed | Not disclosed |
| Racket | Aug 2021 | Ex-City Pages | ~3,000 | $322K (2024) | Near break-even |
| Discourse Blog | 2020 | Ex-Splinter | ~1,600+ | Not disclosed | Not disclosed |
| Aftermath | Late 2023 | Ex-Kotaku | Not disclosed | Not disclosed | Not disclosed |
| Colorado Sun | Sep 2018 | Ex-Denver Post | 125K newsletter | Not disclosed | Nonprofit model |

[[Defector Media]] is the benchmark — launched with 10,000 subscribers on day one, grew to 40,000, profitable every year, $4.6M annual revenue. [[404 Media]] achieved profitability fastest (six months, on $4,000 total startup capital).

## The economics

Why this works now — the infrastructure stack collapsed costs:

| Layer | Tool | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| Publishing | Ghost (open-source) | $9–19/mo |
| Payments | [[Stripe]] | ~2.9% + $0.30 per txn |
| Email | Ghost built-in or Mailchimp | Minimal |
| Office | None (remote) | $0 |

A publication with 5,000 subscribers at $80/yr generates $400K revenue. After [[Stripe]] fees (~$12K) and Ghost hosting (~$228/yr), net revenue is ~$388K — enough for 4–5 journalists with no office. Infrastructure cost is under 4% of revenue. Ten years ago, subscription management alone would have required a six-figure technology investment.

Typical revenue per subscriber: $80–100/yr across most outlets.

## Limitations

The subscription plateau is the central challenge. [[Defector Media]]'s trajectory is the template: explosive launch → rapid growth → plateau. Revenue growth slowed from 20% to 2.2% year-over-year by year four. Each incremental 1,000 subscribers is harder than the last.

| Limitation | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Scale ceiling | Works at 4–20 employees; no obvious path from $5M to $50M without changing the model |
| Key-person risk | Outlets depend on specific bylines with built-in audiences |
| Revenue concentration | 85–100% from subscriptions; one revenue stream = fragile |
| Compensation limits | Racket partners earn ~$40K; Hell Gate pays $75K in NYC — below market |
| Governance rigidity | Early decisions about structure become entrenched and hard to change |
| Not a systemic fix | Total US newspaper revenue fell from $49.4B (2005) to $9.8B (2022) — these outlets can't fill that gap |

## Historical antecedents

| Predecessor | Era | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-------|
| I.F. Stone's Weekly | 1953–1971 | One-man operation, reached 70K circulation; only US journalist to challenge Gulf of Tonkin account |
| George Seldes, "In Fact" | 1940–1950 | Reader-supported weekly; directly inspired Stone |
| Associated Press | 1846 | Original journalist cooperative — five NYC papers pooled telegraph costs |
| Die Tageszeitung (Germany) | 1978 | 16,000+ member-owners; still running |
| New Internationalist (UK) | 1973 | Raised £700K from 3,400 community-share investors |

## Investment implications

Not directly investable (private, tiny, no outside capital by design). The signal is structural:

- Validates subscription-funded journalism economics at small scale
- Ghost and [[Stripe]] are the infrastructure winners — near-zero switching costs create lock-in
- Advertising-dependent media remains structurally impaired
- Corporate media consolidation (Alden Global, [[Apollo Global Management]]) keeps creating the conditions that produce new cooperative outlets
- The model caps at ~$5M revenue per outlet, so aggregators and platform providers capture more total value than any single publication
