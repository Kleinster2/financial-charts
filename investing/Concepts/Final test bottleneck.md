**Final test** is the last electrical/functional check before a chip ships. As AI packages get larger and hotter, it's becoming a hidden constraint.

## Why it's a bottleneck

| Trend | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Bigger packages (~120×120mm) | Harder to handle, more expensive units at risk |
| Higher heat output | Thermal management during test is harder |
| More complexity (HBM, cold plates, lids) | Longer test times |
| Legacy equipment limits | Pogo pins melt/deform at high temps |

Even if foundry and [[Advanced packaging]] capacity exist, final test can be the constraint.

---

## Technical challenges

- **Active Thermal Control (ATC)** — multi-zone thermal control required
- **Socket redesign** — heat breaks legacy pogo-pin sockets
- **Equipment refresh cycle** — new handlers needed for each generation

---

## Who benefits

| Company | Role | Why they benefit |
|---------|------|------------------|
| **Cohu** (NASDAQ: COHU) | Test handlers | Eclipse platform for extreme thermal AI testing |
| **ASE** | OSAT (assembly + test) | Expanding capacity, AI/HPC revenue doubling |
| **Advantest** | Test equipment | ATE (automatic test equipment) leader |

## Supply chain position

```
Foundry (TSMC, Samsung)
    ↓
Packaging (TSMC CoWoS, ASE)
    ↓
Final Test (ASE, Cohu equipment)  ← bottleneck
    ↓
Ship to customer (NVIDIA, AMD)
```

---

## Implications

- Another constraint on AI chip throughput beyond foundry/packaging
- Equipment companies (Cohu, Advantest) have pricing power
- OSATs (ASE) investing heavily — 2025 capex +$1B
- Not a moat for [[TSMC]] — they don't do final test

---

## For investing

This is a "picks and shovels" angle:
- Don't have to pick foundry winners
- Bet on the bottleneck (test equipment, OSATs)
- Less competitive, more capacity-constrained
