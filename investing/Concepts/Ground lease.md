# Ground Lease

**Separation of land ownership from building ownership** — the landowner leases the ground to a tenant who owns (or builds) the structure on top. Common in prime urban real estate where land is too valuable to sell outright.

## How it works

| Component | Owner | Rights |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Land (ground)** | Ground lessor (landowner) | Collects ground rent; owns improvements at lease end |
| **Building** | Ground lessee (tenant) | Owns structure during lease; pays ground rent |
| **Improvements** | Ground lessee (during term) | Reverts to landowner at expiration |

**Key feature:** At lease expiration, the building typically reverts to the landowner — creating a "ticking clock" on building ownership.

## Economic logic

### Why landowners use ground leases

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Retain asset** | Keep land in family/entity forever |
| **Steady income** | Ground rent with periodic escalations |
| **Upside capture** | Building reverts at lease end |
| **Estate planning** | Land stays in trust/foundation |

### Why tenants accept ground leases

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lower capital** | Don't need to buy land outright |
| **Prime locations** | Access sites that won't be sold |
| **Development rights** | Build/improve on leased ground |
| **Financing flexibility** | Can mortgage building separately |

## Lease terms

Typical ground lease structures:

| Term | Typical range |
|------|---------------|
| **Initial term** | 49-99 years |
| **Renewal options** | Often available |
| **Ground rent** | Fixed + escalations (CPI or resets) |
| **Subordination** | Whether land is subordinate to building mortgage |

**Subordinated vs. unsubordinated:**
- **Subordinated:** Landowner agrees to be junior to building lender — more attractive to tenants
- **Unsubordinated:** Landowner stays senior — safer for landowner, harder to finance building

## Financing implications

Ground leases create layered collateral structures:

| Lien position | Collateral | Typical lender |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **First** | Ground + ground lease | Banks, CMBS |
| **Second** | Building only | Mezzanine lenders |
| **Equity** | Leasehold interest | Building owner |

**The Saks example:** In 2014, HBC originated a $1.25B mortgage on [[611 Fifth Avenue]] — but the collateral was only the **ground and ground lease**, NOT the building itself. S&P explicitly noted: "The Saks Fifth Avenue building is not collateral for the loan."

## Case study: Saks Fifth Avenue

The [[611 Fifth Avenue]] Saks flagship demonstrates ground lease complexity:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ground** | Owned by HBC/[[Saks Global]] |
| **Ground lease** | HBC is both lessor and lessee (consolidated) |
| **Building** | Owned by HBC/[[Saks Global]] |
| **2014 mortgage** | Secured by ground + lease only, NOT building |

**The twist:** HBC owns both the land and the building, but structured the 2014 mortgage to only encumber the ground. This kept the building "unencumbered" for potential future financing — which became relevant in the [[Saks bankruptcy]] when the flagship was pledged for [[DIP financing]].

## Common ground lease locations

Ground leases are prevalent in markets where landowners won't sell:

| Location | Why ground leases common |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Manhattan** | Institutional/family landowners, scarcity |
| **London** | Aristocratic estates, Crown Estate |
| **Hawaii** | Kamehameha Schools, Bishop Estate |
| **Hong Kong** | Government land leases |

## Investment considerations

**Risks for building owners:**
- Lease expiration (building reverts)
- Ground rent escalations
- Subordination restrictions limit refinancing
- Landowner approval requirements

**Risks for landowners:**
- Tenant default/bankruptcy
- Building deterioration
- Long-term below-market rents if poorly structured
