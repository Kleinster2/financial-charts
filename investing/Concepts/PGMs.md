# PGMs ([[Platinum]] Group Metals)

**PGMs** — [[Platinum]], palladium, rhodium. Primarily auto catalysts. [[EV transition]] = structural headwind. Hydrogen fuel cells = potential offset for platinum.

---

## The metals

| Metal | Price tier | Primary use | EV impact |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **[[Platinum]]** | ~$950/oz | [[Diesel]] catalysts, jewelry, hydrogen | Mixed |
| **[[Palladium]]** | ~$950/oz | Gasoline catalysts | Negative |
| **Rhodium** | ~$4,500/oz | Catalysts (small volumes) | Negative |

Rhodium is rarest — extreme price volatility (hit $29,000 in 2021).

## Demand breakdown

**[[Platinum]]:**

| Use | Share |
|-----|-------|
| Auto catalysts | ~40% |
| Jewelry | ~30% |
| Industrial | ~20% |
| Investment | ~10% |

**[[Palladium]]:**

| Use | Share |
|-----|-------|
| Auto catalysts | ~85% |
| Electronics | ~10% |
| Other | ~5% |

[[Palladium]] far more exposed to auto catalyst decline.

## Supply concentration

**Geographic risk:**

| Country | [[Platinum]] | [[Palladium]] |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **South [[Africa]]** | ~70% | ~40% |
| **[[Russia]]** | ~15% | ~40% |
| Other | ~15% | ~20% |

**Risks:**
- South [[Africa]]: Power grid instability, labor issues, aging mines
- [[Russia]]: Sanctions risk (Nornickel = major producer)

---

## [[EV transition]] headwind

**The bear case:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| EVs don't need catalytic converters | Structural demand decline |
| ICE vehicle peak | 2025-2030 expected |
| Tightening emissions = more PGMs per car | Partial offset |
| Hybrid vehicles | Still need catalysts |

**Timeline matters:** ICE vehicles will be produced for decades, but growth is over.

## Hydrogen fuel cell tailwind (platinum)

**The bull case for platinum:**

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fuel cell catalyst | [[Platinum]] required for PEM fuel cells |
| Heavy transport | Trucks, buses, ships favor hydrogen |
| Green hydrogen push | Government subsidies globally |
| Load per vehicle | 30-60g platinum per fuel cell vehicle |

**vs Battery EVs:**
- Passenger cars → batteries winning
- Heavy duty/long haul → hydrogen has advantages
- [[Platinum]] demand depends on hydrogen adoption pace

---

## Investment thesis

**[[Platinum]] — mixed:**
- EV headwind on diesel catalysts
- Hydrogen fuel cell optionality
- Trading below palladium (historically unusual)
- South [[Africa]] supply risks
- Jewelry demand stable

**[[Palladium]] — bearish:**
- 85% auto catalyst exposure
- Gasoline ICE declining fastest
- [[Russia]] supply risk (could be bull or bear)
- Substitution to platinum possible

**Rhodium — speculative:**
- Tiny market, extreme volatility
- No investment vehicles
- Pure auto catalyst play

## Investment vehicles

**ETFs:**

| Ticker | Metal | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| PPLT | [[Platinum]] | abrdn Physical [[Platinum]] |
| PALL | [[Palladium]] | abrdn Physical [[Palladium]] |
| SPPP | [[Platinum]] + [[Palladium]] | Sprott basket |

**Miners:**

| Company | Ticker | Exposure |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Anglo American [[Platinum]] | AMS (JSE) | [[Platinum]], South [[Africa]] |
| Impala [[Platinum]] | IMP (JSE) | [[Platinum]], South [[Africa]] |
| Sibanye Stillwater | SBSW | PGMs + gold, US + SA |
| Nornickel | GMKN (MCX) | [[Palladium]], [[Russia]] (sanctions risk) |

---

## Historical context

**[[Palladium]]'s rise:**
- 2016: ~$500/oz
- 2022 peak: ~$3,400/oz ([[Russia]] invasion)
- Current: ~$950/oz

**What happened:** [[Diesel]] scandal (2015) shifted demand to gasoline = palladium. Now reversing as EVs rise.

**[[Platinum]] discount:**
- Historically platinum > palladium
- Now trading at parity or discount
- Mean reversion thesis exists

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| EV adoption faster than expected | Accelerates catalyst decline |
| Hydrogen slower than expected | [[Platinum]] loses offset |
| [[Russia]] sanctions | Supply shock (palladium) |
| South [[Africa]] grid collapse | Supply shock (platinum) |
| Substitution | [[Platinum]] ↔ palladium in catalysts |
