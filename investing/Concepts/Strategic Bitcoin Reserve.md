**Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** — Proposal for the US government to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. A core plank of the [[Trump II]] financial sovereignty agenda.

---

## The Policy (Jan 2026 Status)

*   **Goal:** Acquire 1 million BTC (~5% of supply) over 5 years.
*   **Mechanism:** Federal Reserve or Treasury purchase program; converting seized assets (DOJ seizures) into permanent holdings.
*   **Legislative Vehicle:** The "BITCOIN Act" (Sen. Lummis), championed by the Trump administration.

## Strategic Rationale

| Driver | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Debt Hedge** | Hedge against US dollar debasement and $36T+ national debt. |
| **Geopolitics** | Counter-move to China's gold accumulation and [[Digital Yuan]]. |
| **Innovation** | Signal that the US is the "Crypto Capital of the Planet." |
| **Asymmetric Bet** | "If it goes to millions, we need to own it." |

## US vs China Financial War

See [[US-China financial war]].

*   **China:** Banned crypto mining/trading; launched centralized [[Digital Yuan]] for surveillance and sanctions evasion.
*   **USA:** Embracing decentralized Bitcoin as a "Freedom Money" alternative to state-controlled CBDCs.
*   **The Race:** Who controls the future of digital value transfer?

---

## Market Impact

*   **Sovereign FOMO:** If the US buys, other nations (Saudi Arabia, Japan, G7) may feel compelled to front-run or match.
*   **Price Floor:** US Gov becomes the ultimate "Diamond Hands" holder (HODLer of last resort).
*   **Mining:** Encourages domestic mining for "Energy Dominance" (see [[TeraWulf]], [[Core Scientific]]).

---

## Risks

*   **Volatility:** Bitcoin crashes could impair the national balance sheet.
*   **Dollar Undermining:** Critics argue it implicitly admits the USD is flawed.
*   **Execution:** Front-running by private market participants pushes price up before Gov can buy.
