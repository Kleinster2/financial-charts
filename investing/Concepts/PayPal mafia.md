## The 2007 Fortune photo

The term "PayPal Mafia" was coined when Fortune published a photo of former PayPal employees dressed as mobsters. The image — with Thiel as the "don" — crystallized the network's influence.

---

## Political influence (2024-2025)

| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| [[Elon Musk]] | Close Trump ally, X owner, DOGE |
| David Sacks | White House AI & crypto czar |
| [[Peter Thiel]] | Major Republican donor |
| Keith Rabois | Trump supporter |

The mafia has shifted from apolitical techno-libertarianism to active political engagement, mostly right-leaning.

## Investment relevance

**Why the PayPal mafia matters:**

1. **Network = signal** — When mafia members invest together, pay attention.

2. **Company factory** — Tesla, SpaceX, Palantir, LinkedIn, YouTube all trace back here.

3. **VC influence** — Founders Fund, Sequoia (Botha), Greylock (Hoffman) shape tech funding.

4. **Political power** — Now directly influencing US tech/AI/crypto policy.

5. **Pattern recognition** — Contrarian, technical, long-term thinking. Look for founders with similar traits.
