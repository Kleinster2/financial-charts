Data center demand is driving electricity price increases across the US, with wholesale prices up 100-200%+ in areas near significant DC activity.

---

## Bloomberg analysis (Sep 2025)

**Bloomberg News analyzed wholesale electricity prices at 25,000 grid nodes** using Grid Status and DC Byte data. Key finding: **70%+ of nodes with price increases are within 50 miles of significant data center activity.**

## Wholesale price changes (April 2020 to April 2025)

| City | 2020 | 2025 | Change |
|------|------|------|--------|
| **Buffalo** | $11 | $33 | **+197%** |
| **Baltimore** | $17 | $38 | **+125%** |
| **Columbus** | $17 | $35 | **+110%** |
| **Tulsa** | $14 | $28 | **+108%** |
| New Orleans | $16 | $29 | +78% |
| Minneapolis | $14 | $24 | +65% |
| San Francisco | $21 | $35 | +65% |
| Chicago | $15 | $24 | +64% |
| Los Angeles | $19 | $29 | +52% |
| Houston | $17 | $25 | +52% |
| Phoenix | $16 | $21 | +32% |
| Salt Lake City | $17 | $22 | +32% |
| Portland | $18 | $22 | +22% |

*Prices in $/MWh. Baltimore/Buffalo near "Data Center Alley" (Northern Virginia).*

**2020 baseline:** ~$16/MWh average nationally, minimal variation.
**2025:** High geographic dispersion — some areas 2-3x higher, central states have *negative* prices (renewable surplus).

## Human impact

**Baltimore case study:**
- Kevin Stanley (57, disability): bills +80% in 3 years
- "We can't figure out why it has increased so much"
- Over an hour from Data Center Alley but on same grid (PJM)

**The mechanism:** Wholesale commodity costs pass through to retail bills. Regional grids affect customers even 50+ miles from data centers.

## Expert warnings

| Source | Quote |
|--------|-------|
| **Mark Christie** (ex-FERC chairman) | "The reliability crisis is here now; it's not off in the distance somewhere" |
| **David Crane** (Generate Capital CEO) | "The data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans" |
| **David Crane** | "Risks brownout situations in some US power markets within the next year or two" |
| **[[UBS]]** (Matthew Mish) | ~$100B AI debt raised per quarter "raises eyebrows for anyone that has seen credit cycles" |

## Demand projections (BNEF)

| Metric | Current | 2035 |
|--------|---------|------|
| US DC share of electricity | ~4% | **~9%** |
| Growth comparison | — | "Biggest surge since air conditioning caught on in 1960s" |
| Global DC electricity rank | — | **\#4 country** (behind [[China]], US, [[India]]) |

## Global spillover

| Country | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **[[Japan]]** | Power auction prices hitting all-time highs |
| **Malaysia** | Lifting DC electricity rates as supply tightens |
| **[[UK]]** | [[Aurora]] Energy: +9% power prices by 2040 from DC demand |

---

## Texas exception

**Renewables mitigating price increases:**
- Boom in solar, wind, battery storage
- Some Texas nodes show *negative* prices (more produced than consumed)
- Only US region where prices fell in some areas

---

## Policy tension

Trump promised to cut electricity prices 50% within 18 months. Instead:
- Prices rising since inauguration
- Energy chief says "soaring power bills are now his biggest concern"
- One Big Beautiful Bill strips solar/wind support — BNEF forecasts **23% less** renewable deployment by 2035

## Political backlash

**Senate investigation** into DC power costs (Jan 2026):

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Senators | Warren, Van Hollen, Blumenthal (D) |
| Targets | [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon]], [[Meta]], [[CoreWeave]], [[Digital Realty]], [[Equinix]] |
| Deadline | Jan 12, 2026 |
| Demand | DCs pay more upfront for grid infrastructure |

**Senator criticism:**
> "Tech companies regularly hide as much information as possible from the communities in which their data centers will be built... failing to pay their fair share of their electricity rates."

**Political context:** Power affordability became major issue in 2025 elections. Democrats won key races on pocketbook messaging.
