# Time consistency

#concept #macro #economics #fed #nobel

**Time consistency** — The problem that optimal policy today may not be optimal tomorrow, even with unchanged preferences. Policymakers who cannot commit to rules produce worse outcomes than those who can. Foundation for central bank independence and inflation targeting. Discovered by [[Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward Prescott]] (1977 Nobel Prize-winning work).

---

## The core problem

A central bank announces it will keep inflation at 2%. Workers and firms believe this and set wages/prices accordingly. But once those decisions are locked in, the central bank faces a temptation: a surprise inflation burst could boost employment and output in the short term.

Rational actors anticipate this temptation. They don't believe the 2% promise. They set higher wages expecting inflation. The result: high inflation occurs even though *everyone prefers low inflation*.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Promise** | Central bank announces low inflation target |
| **2. Anticipation** | Rational actors doubt commitment |
| **3. Lock-in** | Wages/prices set based on expected inflation |
| **4. Temptation** | CB can now inflate for short-term gain |
| **5. Outcome** | Higher inflation than anyone wanted |

This is **time inconsistency**: the optimal policy changes over time even though nothing about preferences changed.

---

## The inflation bias

Without commitment mechanisms, discretionary monetary policy produces an **inflation bias** — systematically higher inflation than optimal.

| Discretionary policy | Rules-based policy |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Central bank optimizes each period | Central bank commits to rule |
| Private sector anticipates this | Private sector trusts the rule |
| Higher inflation expectations | Anchored expectations |
| Higher actual inflation | Lower actual inflation |
| Same unemployment (long-run) | Same unemployment (long-run) |

**Key insight:** Discretion produces worse outcomes than rules, even with a well-intentioned central bank.

## Solutions

| Solution | How it works | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Independence** | Insulate CB from political pressure | [[Federal Reserve]], ECB, BOE |
| **Inflation targeting** | Explicit numerical commitment | 2% targets adopted globally |
| **Reputation** | Long tenure builds credibility | Volcker, Greenspan |
| **Transparency** | Forward guidance constrains future self | Fed dots, meeting minutes |
| **Conservative banker** | Appoint someone who hates inflation more | Volcker appointment 1979 |

---

## Beyond monetary policy

Time consistency applies wherever policymakers face commitment problems:

| Domain | Time inconsistency problem |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Tax policy** | Promise low capital taxes to encourage investment, then tax capital once it's in place |
| **Patent policy** | Promise patent protection to encourage R&D, then expropriate after invention |
| **Sovereign debt** | Promise to repay to borrow cheaply, then default after receiving funds |
| **Regulation** | Promise stable rules to attract investment, then change rules after sunk costs |

---

## Investment implications

| Concept | Market application |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Credibility premium** | Credible central banks → lower inflation premium → lower yields |
| **Forward guidance** | Fed "dots" work only if markets believe commitment |
| **Independence risk** | [[Fed independence]] erosion → credibility loss → yields rise |
| **Regime changes** | New CB chair → markets assess credibility shift |
| **Policy surprise asymmetry** | Dovish surprises from hawkish CB = credible; from dovish CB = concerning |

**Current relevance (Jan 2026):** [[Fed independence]] concerns (DOJ investigation of Powell) directly threaten the institutional solution to time consistency that has anchored inflation expectations since Volcker.

## The 1977 paper

**"Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans"**
Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott, *Journal of Political Economy*, 1977

> "Even if there is an agreed-upon, fixed social objective function and policymakers know the timing and magnitude of the effects of their actions, discretionary policy, namely, the selection of that decision which is best, given the current situation and a correct evaluation of the end-of-period position, does not result in the social objective function being maximized."

The paper showed this mathematically using dynamic programming — optimal policy at time t depends on decisions made at time t-1, but at time t-1 you can't commit your time-t self.

## Real-world validation

| Event | Time consistency lesson |
|-------|------------------------|
| **1970s stagflation** | Burns/Fed lacked credibility, inflation unanchored |
| **Volcker disinflation** | Commitment + pain → restored credibility |
| **1990s Great Moderation** | Independent CBs with targets → stable inflation |
| **Turkey 2018-2023** | Politicized CB → hyperinflation (see [[Fed independence]]) |
| **UK mini-budget 2022** | Fiscal credibility loss → instant bond vigilante response |

## Violations and consequences

Concrete cases where K-P principles were violated — political interference destroyed central bank credibility, producing exactly the inflation bias the theory predicts.

### United States 1970s — Nixon/Burns

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Nixon pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns for easy money before 1972 election |
| **Evidence** | Nixon tapes: "I really don't care what you do after April [Election Day]" |
| **Tactics** | Anonymous leaks, threats to expand Fed board, floated White House control proposals |
| **Inflation** | 1950s-60s avg: **2.3%** → 1970s avg: **7.1%** → 1974 peak: **12.3%** |
| **Fix required** | Volcker's 20% rates (1980-81), deep recession, restored credibility through pain |

Burns is remembered as the "worst Fed chair in history" — the counterfactual to Volcker's success.

### Turkey 2018-2023 — Erdogan

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Erdogan fired governors who wouldn't cut rates; deleted 5-year term protection |
| **Governors fired** | Çetinkaya (2019), Uysal (2020), Agbal (2021 — after just 4 months for *raising* rates) |
| **Erdogan view** | "Interest rates are the mother of all evil" |
| **Inflation** | 2017-18: **14%** → 2022: **85%** → 2023: **65%** |
| **Lira** | Lost 80%+ vs USD |
| **Fix required** | Orthodox policy restored late 2023; rates raised to 50% |

Classic K-P: markets knew each new governor would face same pressure, so no credibility even with personnel changes.

### Argentina 2010-2024 — Kirchner/Fernández

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | President Kirchner fired Governor Redrado (2010) for refusing to divert reserves to pay debt |
| **Pattern** | Repeated political interference; CB used to finance fiscal deficits |
| **Inflation** | 2010: **20%** → 2019: **50%** → 2023: **140%** → 2024: **290%** |
| **Fix attempted** | Milei shock therapy (2024); inflation still 100%+ |

### Zimbabwe 2007-2008 — Mugabe

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Central bank printed money for government despite "legal independence" |
| **Inflation** | 2007: **24,000%** → Nov 2008: **89.7 sextillion percent** (89.7 × 10²¹) |
| **Outcome** | Currency abandoned; dollarization |
| **Lesson** | Legal independence means nothing without actual independence |

### Venezuela 2010s-present — Chavez/Maduro

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | CB directed to print money for fiscal deficits; oil revenue collapse |
| **Inflation** | 2015: **180%** → 2018: **1,700,000%** → 2025: **270%** (highest globally) |
| **Outcome** | Economic collapse, 7M+ emigrated |

### Brazil 2011-2016 — Dilma Rousseff

The cleanest K-P "controlled experiment" — same country that succeeded with Plano Real (1994), then deliberately undermined its own institutions.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Replaced entire CB board (2011); adopted "New Economic Matrix" prioritizing low rates over inflation target |
| **Policy** | Cut Selic from 12.25% → 7.25% despite above-target inflation expectations |
| **Taylor Rule** | Systematic deviations accumulated 2011-2014; rates held below model-predicted levels |
| **Price controls** | Suppressed electricity/fuel prices, hiding true inflation, creating fiscal time bomb |
| **Inflation** | 2010: **5.9%** → 2015: **10.7%** |
| **Currency** | BRL/USD: 1.66 → 3.90 |
| **Fiscal** | Primary balance: +2.7% GDP → **-1.9% GDP** |
| **Fix required** | Selic raised to 14.25%; Dilma impeached (2016); Temer fiscal reforms |

**Why Dilma matters for K-P:** She didn't cause hyperinflation — "only" doubled inflation from 5% to 10%. But this moderate violation still destroyed credibility, required painful correction (rates doubled), triggered recession (-3.5% GDP), and ended her presidency. Even partial K-P violations have severe consequences.

**Research finding:** "The new administration reversed a long-term effort of credibility construction dating back to the 1990s."

**Lesson for Lula III:** The 2021 independence law exists precisely because of Dilma. Gabriel Galípolo — Lula's own pick — took office as CB president Jan 1, 2025 and immediately proved the law works: he hiked the Selic from 10.75% to **15%** (+450bp) despite Lula's pressure, held rates at 15% since July 2025, and vowed to keep them high "for extended period." Inflation still at 5.53% (vs 3% target) but expectations anchoring. **K-P vindicated** — institutional design trumped political loyalty.

### The universal pattern

Every case follows the same K-P script:

```
Political pressure for easy money
    → Central bank loses credibility
    → Inflation expectations unanchor
    → Actual inflation rises
    → More pressure to accommodate
    → Hyperinflation spiral
    → Eventually forced to restore independence (or collapse)
```

The theory's predictive power is remarkable: violate K-P → get inflation bias → require painful correction.

## Policy reforms directly influenced by K-P

The 1977 paper transformed central banking worldwide. Few academic papers have had such direct policy impact.

### Central bank independence

Kenneth Rogoff (1985) extended K-P: appoint a central banker **more hawkish than society** — someone who genuinely hates inflation more than the median voter. The "conservative banker" solves time consistency because they won't want to inflate.

| Institution | Reform | K-P mechanism |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| [[Federal Reserve]] | Volcker appointment (1979) | Credible inflation hawk |
| Reserve Bank of New Zealand | First inflation target (1990) | Explicit numerical commitment |
| Bank of England | Independence (1997) | Insulation from Treasury |
| ECB | Maastricht Treaty (1992) | Treaty-level independence, price stability mandate |
| Riksbank (Sweden) | Independence + target (1993) | Full K-P framework |
| [[Banco Central do Brasil]] | Plano Real (1994) + Independence law (2021) | Fiscal reform first, then credible currency; formal independence after Dilma |

### Inflation targeting adoption

| Country | Year adopted | Pre-reform avg inflation | Post-reform avg |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| New Zealand | 1990 | 11.7% (1980s) | 2.3% (1990s) |
| Canada | 1991 | 6.5% (1980s) | 1.9% (1990s) |
| UK | 1992 | 6.5% (1980s) | 2.7% (1990s) |
| Sweden | 1993 | 7.4% (1980s) | 1.5% (1990s) |
| US (formal) | 2012 | 5.2% (1965-89) | 2.0% (1990-2012) |

The Fed behaved as if targeting 2% from ~1990, but didn't announce it until 2012.

### Forward guidance

Modern Fed communication — dots, projections, meeting minutes, press conferences — is a commitment device. By stating future intentions publicly, the Fed constrains its future self.

| Tool | K-P function |
|------|--------------|
| FOMC dots | Signal rate path, anchor expectations |
| Forward guidance language | "Considerable time," "patient" = commitment |
| Press conferences | Chair explains reaction function |
| Meeting minutes | Transparency constrains discretion |

---

## Beyond monetary policy (expanded)

| Domain | Time inconsistency problem | K-P solution |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Too-big-to-fail** | Promise no bailouts → bail out anyway → moral hazard | Dodd-Frank resolution authority, living wills |
| **Flood insurance** | Promise no subsidies → subsidize after flood → build in flood zones | FEMA maps, mandatory insurance zones |
| **Climate policy** | Commit to carbon targets → renege when costs hit → no green investment | Paris Agreement, carbon pricing, international treaties |
| **Patent/IP** | Promise protection → expropriate after invention → no R&D | WTO/TRIPS, international enforcement |
| **Sovereign debt** | Promise to repay → default after receiving funds → high borrowing costs | IMF conditionality, reputation markets |
