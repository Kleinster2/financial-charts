# DIP Financing

**Debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing** — Special loans provided to companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy to fund operations during restructuring. Critical lifeline that determines whether a company survives or liquidates.

---

## How it works

When a company files Chapter 11, it doesn't stop operating. DIP financing provides the liquidity to:
- Pay employees and vendors
- Maintain inventory
- Fund restructuring costs
- Avoid immediate liquidation

**Key feature:** DIP loans get **superpriority status** — they're repaid before all existing debt, including secured creditors.

## The process

| Step | Timing | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Filing | Day 0 | Company files Chapter 11 petition |
| 2. DIP motion | Day 0-1 | Company requests DIP financing approval |
| 3. Interim approval | Days 1-3 | Court approves partial draw (e.g., $400M of $1.75B) |
| 4. Creditor notice | Days 1-14 | All creditors notified, can object |
| 5. Final hearing | Day 14+ | Court considers full approval; objections heard |
| 6. Final approval | Varies | Full DIP facility available |

## Key terms

### Superpriority
DIP loans rank ahead of all pre-petition debt — secured, unsecured, everything. This is the incentive for lenders to provide financing to distressed companies.

### Priming liens
When a company pledges collateral that already secures existing debt, the DIP lender gets a "priming lien" — their claim on that collateral jumps ahead of existing secured creditors.

**This is where fights happen.** Existing secured creditors may object to being primed.

### Exit financing
Separate from DIP financing — this is debt arranged to fund operations *after* emerging from bankruptcy. Often committed alongside DIP as part of restructuring plan.

## Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Interest rates | Higher than normal loans (risk premium) |
| Fees | Commitment fees, draw fees, exit fees |
| Covenants | Tight operational restrictions |
| Collateral | Usually all remaining unencumbered assets |
| Typical lenders | Distressed debt funds, existing bondholders, specialty lenders |

**Why lenders do it:** Superpriority means very low loss rates. Plus fees are lucrative.

## Case study: [[Saks Global]] (Jan 2026)

| Component | Amount | Provider |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| DIP term loan | $1.0B | [[Pentwater Capital]], [[Bracebridge Capital]] |
| ABL facility | $240M | [[Bank of America]] |
| Exit financing | $500M | Same bondholders |
| **Total** | **$1.75B** | |

**The fight:** [[Amazon]] objected to DIP approval, arguing the $3.6B Fifth Avenue flagship was already pledged to secure their interests. Saks used the flagship as DIP collateral anyway, subordinating Amazon.

**Judge Perez's ruling:** Approved after 7.5-hour hearing. Reasoning: without DIP financing, liquidation was the only option. CRO Mark Weinstein: company would be "dead in the water" without it.

**Urgency:** Saks had $30-35M in bills due *that day*. DIP approval was existential.

## Investment implications

**For distressed debt investors:**
- DIP loans are among safest credit investments (superpriority + collateral)
- Returns come from fees + interest, not equity upside
- Key risk: liquidation value below DIP claims

**For existing creditors:**
- DIP financing can prime your collateral
- Objecting rarely succeeds if company truly needs the money
- Better to negotiate protections than block outright

**For equity holders:**
- DIP financing usually means equity is wiped
- Only exception: company worth more than all debt claims (rare in bankruptcy)
