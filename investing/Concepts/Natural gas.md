# Natural gas

**Natural gas** — US Henry Hub positioning for firmer 2026. AI power demand + LNG exports lifting floor. EIA expects $4.00/MMBtu avg in 2026.

## Current price (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price | **~$3.50/MMBtu** |
| Jan 2026 contract | ~$4.02/MMBtu |
| 12-month strip | ~$3.76/MMBtu |
| 2026 avg forecast (EIA) | **$4.00/MMBtu** (+16% vs 2025) |
| Q4 2026 forecast | ~$4.50/MMBtu |

## 2026 outlook

**Forecasts:**

| Source | [[Target]] | View |
|--------|--------|------|
| EIA | $4.00/MMBtu avg | +16% vs 2025 |
| [[Bank of America]] | $4.00/MMBtu | Neutral |
| Bernstein | $5.00/MMBtu | "Faith in five" — new equilibrium |

**Bernstein thesis:** $5/mcf represents new equilibrium after decade+ at ~$3.50/mcf.

---

## Demand drivers

**Three pillars:**

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **AI/data centers** | Growing electricity load |
| **LNG exports** | New infrastructure coming online |
| **Geopolitical** | [[Europe]] weaning off Russian gas |

AI power demand increasingly material — see [[Power constraints]].

---

## Supply outlook

**EIA projections:**

| Year | Dry gas production |
|------|-------------------|
| 2023 | 103.6 bcfd (record) |
| 2026 | **109.1 bcfd** |

Production rising but demand growth may outpace.

---

## LNG export impact

**US LNG buildout:**
- Multiple export terminals coming online
- Increased global demand ([[Europe]], [[Asia]])
- Tightens domestic supply
- See [[LNG]] for detailed coverage

---

## Investment thesis

**Bull case:**
- AI electricity demand structural
- LNG exports tightening supply
- $5/mcf may be new floor (Bernstein)
- Production growth manageable
- Winter volatility = upside

**Bear case:**
- Warm weather = demand destruction
- Production can ramp quickly
- Permian associated gas growing
- Renewables displacing gas in power gen
- Storage levels adequate

## Investment vehicles

**ETFs:**

| Ticker | Name | Exposure |
|--------|------|----------|
| UNG | US Natural Gas Fund | Futures-based |
| BOIL | ProShares Ultra Bloomberg NG | 2x leveraged |
| KOLD | ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg NG | -2x inverse |
| FCG | First Trust Natural Gas ETF | Gas equities |

**Producers:**

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[EQT]] | [[EQT]] | Largest US gas producer |
| Coterra | CTRA | Marcellus/Permian |
| Antero Resources | AR | Appalachian focus |
| Chesapeake | CHK | Major producer |
| Range Resources | RRC | Marcellus pure-play |
| Southwestern | SWN | Appalachian focus |

---

## Seasonality

**Weather-driven:**
- Winter heating demand = price spikes
- Summer cooling demand = secondary peak
- Shoulder seasons = weakness
- Storage injections/withdrawals key

Current weakness (Jan 2026): Warmer-than-normal forecasts pressuring prices.

## vs Oil

| Factor | Natural Gas | Oil |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Storage visibility | High (weekly EIA) | Moderate |
| Weather sensitivity | Very high | Low |
| Global pricing | Regional (Henry Hub) | Global (Brent) |
| AI relevance | Direct (power gen) | Indirect |
