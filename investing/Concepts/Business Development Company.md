**Business Development Company (BDC)** — A US-specific investment vehicle that lends to middle-market companies (typically $10M-$1B revenue). Created by Congress in 1980 to channel capital to small and mid-sized businesses. Regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Must distribute 90%+ of taxable income to shareholders — functions like a REIT but for loans instead of real estate.

## How BDCs work

```
Investors → BDC → Loans to middle-market companies → Interest income → Distributed to investors
```

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Created | 1980 (Small Business Investment Incentive Act) |
| Regulator | SEC (Investment Company Act of 1940) |
| Distribution requirement | 90%+ of taxable income |
| Tax treatment | Pass-through (no corporate tax if distributing) |
| Leverage limit | 2:1 debt-to-equity (relaxed from 1:1 in 2018) |
| Typical yield | 8-12% |
| Borrower profile | Middle-market, often PE-backed |

## Types

| Type | Structure | Liquidity | Investor base | Example |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Publicly traded** | Listed on exchange | Daily (market price) | Anyone | ARCC ([[Ares Management]]), OBDC ([[Blue Owl]]) |
| **Non-traded** | Not listed | Quarterly redemption windows (typically 5% NAV cap) | Retail/HNW (accredited) | OBDC II ([[Blue Owl]]), BCRED ([[Blackstone]]) |
| **Private** | Institutional only | Lock-up periods (3-7 years) | Institutions | Various |

**The critical distinction:** Publicly traded BDCs price in real-time and can trade at discounts to NAV. Non-traded BDCs offer quarterly "liquidity" windows — but the underlying loans are illiquid. This mismatch is the structural vulnerability exposed by the [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]].

## The 5% quarterly redemption mechanic

Non-traded BDCs typically allow investors to redeem up to **5% of NAV per quarter**. This works when:
- Redemption requests are small (1-2% of NAV)
- New inflows offset outflows
- Underlying loans can be sold or mature naturally

It breaks when:
- Redemption requests exceed the 5% cap → investors get pro-rated
- Multiple quarters of excess requests → queue builds, confidence erodes
- Fund must sell illiquid loans at discounts to meet redemptions → NAV declines → more redemptions

This is the **bank run dynamic** that hit [[Blue Owl]] OBDC II in Feb 2026.

## The retail push (2020-2025)

PE firms spent 5 years marketing non-traded BDCs to retail investors as "bond alternatives":

| Pitch | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "8-12% yields" | Real, but from risky middle-market loans |
| "Quarterly liquidity" | 5% cap; underlying loans are illiquid |
| "Low volatility" | Quarterly marks hide real-time losses |
| "Diversified credit" | 14-16% software concentration (all-time high) |
| "Professional management" | Fees are earned on deployment, not avoiding losses |

The target: **$80T in retail/HNW wealth** that institutional PE firms couldn't previously access.

## Largest BDCs

| Fund | Manager | AUM | Type | Status (Feb 2026) |
|------|---------|-----|------|-------------------|
| **BCRED** | [[Blackstone]] | $50B+ | Non-traded | 🟡 Watching |
| **ARCC** | [[Ares Management]] | $26B+ | Publicly traded | 🟡 Watching |
| **OBDC** | [[Blue Owl]] | $16B+ | Publicly traded | 🟡 Watching |
| **OBDC II** | [[Blue Owl]] | $1.7B | Non-traded (finite-life) | 🔴 Gated |

Industry-wide: BDCs with >$1B AUM saw **$2.9B in withdrawal requests in Q4 2025**, up 200% QoQ (Robert A Stanger & Co.).

## Key metrics to watch

| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **NAV/share** | Are underlying loans holding value? |
| **Non-accruals** | What % of loans aren't paying interest? |
| **PIK %** | Payment-in-kind = borrowers deferring cash interest (stress signal) |
| **Interest coverage** | Can borrowers service their debt? |
| **Redemption queue** | How many investors want out? |
| **Premium/discount to NAV** | Market confidence (traded BDCs only) |
| **Distribution coverage** | Can NII cover the dividend? |

## Regulatory framework

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| 70% test | Must invest 70%+ of assets in "qualifying" (private) assets |
| Leverage | 2:1 debt-to-equity max (raised from 1:1 in 2018) |
| Distribution | 90%+ of taxable income to maintain tax pass-through |
| Board | Independent directors required |
| Valuation | Quarterly fair value (board-approved, third-party valuers optional) |
| SEC reporting | 10-K, 10-Q, proxy filings |

**The 2018 leverage change** (from 1:1 to 2:1) doubled the industry's capacity to take risk — right before the biggest credit expansion in history.
