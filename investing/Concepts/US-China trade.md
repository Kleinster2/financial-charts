| **[[Semiconductors]]** | EUV, AI chips, design tools | Legacy chips, scale | [[Export controls]] |

## Tariffs/policy

General tariff rates, Section 301 duties, trade deals.

| Current | Rate |

| General rate | ~49% |
| Section 301 | 25-100% by product |
| Supreme Court | Ruling pending Jan 14 |

See [[US-China tariffs]] for full detail.

## [[Semiconductors]]

Export controls on chips, equipment, technology.

| US restricts | [[China]] response |
|--------------|----------------|
| EUV (total ban) | [[SMIC]] 7nm workarounds |
| AI chips (H100, Blackwell) | Stockpiling, [[Huawei]] [[Ascend]] |
| Design tools | Indigenous alternatives |
| VEU licenses | Case-by-case approval |

See [[Export controls]].

## [[Commodities]]

Fungible raw materials — US has weak cards.

| Commodity | Controller | Leverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| [[Venezuela]] oil | US (new) | Medium |
| [[Agriculture]] | US was \#1 | Weak ([[Brazil]]/[[Argentina]]) |

See [[US-China commodity leverage]].

## Minerals

Critical inputs — [[China]] has strong cards.

| Mineral | [[China]] share | Substitutes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| [[Gallium]] | 99% | Very limited |
| [[Germanium]] | 60% | Limited |
| [[Antimony]] | 48% | None (ammo) |
| Rare earths | 60%+ | Years to build |

See [[Critical minerals]], [[China retaliatory toolkit]].

## [[Trade]] flow

| Metric | 2017 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|
| US imports from [[China]] | $505B | ~$427B |
| US exports to [[China]] | $130B | ~$145B |
| Deficit | $375B | ~$282B |

Deficit down but supply chains often just rerouted (Vietnam, [[Mexico]] — still Chinese-owned).

## Third-country leverage

US increasingly weaponizing trade access to block [[China]] deals in third countries.

### [[Africa]] front

| Tool | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [[AGOA]] | Duty-free access contingent on alignment | [[Kenya]] pressured to drop [[China]] deal (Jan 2026) |

**Pattern:** African countries seeking AGOA renewal face implicit ultimatum — US market access OR [[China]] trade deals. Forces binary choice.

**[[China]] counter:** Belt & Road offers infrastructure investment; AGOA offers market access. Different value propositions, but [[China]] can offer alternative trade preferences to countries US cuts off.

**Watch for:** Ethiopia, South [[Africa]], [[Nigeria]] — large economies with both AGOA access and [[China]] ties.
