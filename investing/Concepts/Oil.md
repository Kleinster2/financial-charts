## Why oil matters for AI thesis

| Connection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Power generation | Natural gas (oil byproduct) fuels peaker plants |
| Energy costs | Oil prices affect electricity prices |
| Petrochemicals | Data center materials (plastics, cooling fluids) |
| Macro | Oil shocks affect capex budgets |

|-----------|-------------|
| WTI | West Texas Intermediate — US benchmark |
| Brent | North Sea — global benchmark |
| Dubai/Oman | Middle East benchmark |
| Spread | Brent-WTI typically $2-5 |

|----------|------------|-------|
| US | ~13M bpd | Shale revolution, \#1 producer |
| Saudi Arabia | ~10M bpd | [[OPEC]] leader, swing producer |
| [[Russia]] | ~10M bpd | Sanctioned, discounted sales |
| [[Canada]] | ~5M bpd | Oil sands, heavy crude |

## Crude types

| Type | Gravity | Sulfur | Premium | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| Light sweet | High API | Low | Highest | WTI, Brent |
| Light sour | High API | High | Moderate | Mars |
| Heavy sour | Low API | High | Discount | Venezuela, [[Canada]] |

**Refinery match:** Complex refineries (Gulf Coast) designed for heavy sour crude.

## [[OPEC]]+ dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Production quotas | Control supply, support prices |
| Saudi spare capacity | ~2-[[3M]] bpd buffer |
| [[Russia]] coordination | Post-2016 alliance |
| Cheating | Members often exceed quotas |
| US shale | Price ceiling (~$80 brings supply) |

## Price drivers

| Factor | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Demand | Economic growth, [[China]] recovery | Recession, EV adoption |
| Supply | [[OPEC]] cuts, outages | US shale, Venezuela return |
| Geopolitics | Middle East conflict | Peace, sanctions lifted |
| Dollar | Weak USD | Strong USD |
| Inventories | Draws | Builds |

## Current dynamics (2026)

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Price | ~$70-75 Brent |
| Supply | Oversupplied near-term |
| [[OPEC]]+ | Managing cuts |
| US shale | Disciplined, not flooding market |
| [[Venezuela]] | [[Maduro capture 2026]] — potential supply increase |
| Demand | Moderate growth |

## Long-term outlook

**Peak demand debate:**

| View | Timeline | Driver |
|------|----------|--------|
| Bullish | Never / 2050 | Developing world growth; [[IEA]] 2026 forecast |
| Moderate | 2030s | EV adoption gradual |
| Bearish | Late 2020s | Rapid EV + policy |

**Reality:** Oil demand still growing, but growth slowing. [[Transport]] ~50% of demand. Peak oil date keeps receding — the [[IEA]] now sees demand potentially growing until 2050 (as of Feb 2026). [[Citigroup]] notes European oil stocks have repriced from "very negative" to "much less negative" terminal values.
