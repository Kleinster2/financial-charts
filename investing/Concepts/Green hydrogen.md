Green hydrogen — hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewable electricity. Currently costs US$4.50-6.00/kg vs. US$1.00-2.00/kg for gray hydrogen (natural gas reforming). Key to decarbonizing steel, ammonia, shipping, and heavy industry — but commercial viability at scale remains elusive. Demand declined ~15% in 2024.

## Why green hydrogen matters

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Green H2 cost | US$4.50-6.00/kg |
| Gray H2 cost | US$1.00-2.00/kg |
| Cost gap | 3-4x (narrowing slowly) |
| Key players | [[Fortescue]], [[H2 Green Steel]], Air Products, Plug Power |
| Use cases | Steel, ammonia, shipping, heavy transport |
| IRA incentive | Up to $3/kg US production tax credit (45V) |

## The color spectrum

| Type | Production method | CO2 intensity |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Gray | Natural gas reforming (SMR) | ~10 kg CO2/kg H2 |
| Blue | SMR + carbon capture | ~2-5 kg CO2/kg H2 |
| Green | Electrolysis + renewables | ~0 kg CO2/kg H2 |
| Pink | Electrolysis + nuclear | ~0 kg CO2/kg H2 |

Green hydrogen's fundamental challenge is that electrolysis requires ~50-55 kWh per kg of H2, making cheap renewable electricity the binding constraint. Regions with the lowest levelized cost of renewables (Middle East, [[Australia]], Chile, [[Norway]]) have the best green hydrogen economics.

## Industry status (2025)

The sector has faced a reality check. [[Fortescue]] — once the most ambitious corporate backer (targeting 15 Mt/year by 2030) — cut 1,400+ jobs across two rounds and wrote down ~$150M in cancelled projects in FY2025. Multiple projects globally have stalled or been cancelled as developers confront the gap between green hydrogen economics and gray hydrogen pricing.

The IRA's 45V production tax credit (up to $3/kg) was the most significant policy catalyst, but implementation delays and political uncertainty have slowed US project FIDs.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global H2 production | ~95 Mt/year (>95% gray) |
| Green H2 share | <1% of total |
| Target applications | Steel, ammonia, shipping |
