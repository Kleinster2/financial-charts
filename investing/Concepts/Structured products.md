## What they are

**Hybrid instruments:**
- Debt-like securities (bond wrapper)
- Performance tied to underlying asset (equity, index, stock)
- Principal protection + enhanced returns
- Issued by banks (credit risk)

**Goal:** Better payouts than bonds with some downside protection.

---

## Product types

| Type | Description | Share |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Autocallables** | Early redemption if asset rises | 50%+ |
| **Dual directional** | Gains in up or down markets | Growing |
| **Principal protection** | Full capital guarantee | Traditional |
| **Yield notes** | Enhanced income | Popular |
| **Digital notes** | Binary payoffs | Niche |

## Autocallables explained

**How they work:**
- Fixed-term investment (typically 1-3 years)
- Quarterly observation dates
- If underlying above trigger → "autocalled" (redeemed early)
- Investor gets principal + coupon
- If not called → continues to next observation

**Example ($100K investment, 10% annual coupon):**

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **1. Never breaches barrier** | 4 quarterly coupons ($2.5K each) = $10K profit |
| **2. Autocalled early (Q2)** | 2 coupons = $5K profit + principal returned |
| **3. Breaches at maturity** | Coupons earned minus principal loss (can be severe) |

**Key insight:** High coupons compensate for tail risk of large losses.

| **Fintech platforms** | Easier access (CAIS, iCapital, Halo) |
| **Private equity fatigue** | Looking for other alternatives |
| **Yield hunger** | Better than bonds |

## Risks

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Issuer credit** | Notes backed by bank (Lehman lesson) |
| **Complexity** | Investors may not understand |
| **Fees** | 1.5-3% embedded upfront |
| **Tail risk** | Large losses if barrier breached |
| **Liquidity** | Hard to sell before maturity |
| **Vol suppression** | Mass selling can spike volatility |

**Benn Eifert (QVR Advisors):**
> "Everybody loves this business. It prints money most of the time. And then usually they find a way to lose money when the markets are crashing."

**Brian Werner (Winthrop Partners):**
> "Structured notes are 'sold,' not 'bought' — particularly at the retail level."

## Lehman legacy

**2008 collapse:**
- Lehman was major issuer
- Billions wiped out when bank failed
- Notes backed by issuer = credit risk
- Years of litigation, partial recovery
- Market stagnated for decade

**Mitigation now:**
- Banks offload risk to hedge funds
- Better hedging practices
- But credit risk remains

---

## Mag 7 opportunity

**Quentin Andre (Citigroup):**
> "Mag. Seven shares represent one of the more interesting opportunities from an implied versus realized volatility pricing perspective."

Heavy issuance on Mag 7 stocks creates vol imbalances = structuring opportunity.
