**China overseas resource acquisition** — Strategic campaign by Chinese state-linked companies to secure global mineral supplies. Accelerating despite Western sanctions, driven by industrial policy and de-dollarization.

---

## Strategic rationale

| Driver | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Resource security** | Reduce dependence on Western-controlled supply chains |
| **Industrial policy** | Feed domestic manufacturing (EVs, batteries, chips) |
| **De-dollarization** | Physical assets vs dollar reserves |
| **Sanctions hedging** | Diversify away from US-controlled systems |
| **First-mover advantage** | Lock up reserves before Western competition |

## Key acquirers

| Company | Focus | Recent deals |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| [[Zijin Mining]] | Gold, copper | Allied Gold ($4B), Akyem ($1B), Kamoa-Kakula |
| [[CMOC Group]] | Cobalt, copper | DRC operations |
| [[Tianqi Lithium]] | Lithium | SQM stake, Australian assets |
| [[Ganfeng Lithium]] | Lithium | Argentina, Mexico, Africa |
| [[CATL]] | Lithium, nickel | Battery supply chain integration |
| [[China Minmetals]] | Diversified | Las Bambas (Peru), MMG |
| [[CNOOC]]/[[Sinopec]] | Oil & gas | Global upstream |

## Geographic focus

| Region | Key assets | Commodities |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Africa** | DRC, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali | Copper, cobalt, gold |
| **Latin America** | Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil | Copper, lithium |
| **Central Asia** | Kazakhstan, Tajikistan | Uranium, gold, copper |
| **Southeast Asia** | Indonesia, Philippines | Nickel, copper |
| **Australia** | Pilbara, lithium belt | Iron ore, lithium |
| **Serbia** | Zijin Bor | Copper |

**Africa strategy:** Chinese companies often acquire Western assets being divested. Zijin bought Akyem from [[Newmont]] (2024) and Allied Gold's African portfolio (2026).

## Commodity priorities

| Commodity | Strategic importance | Key acquirers |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Copper** | EVs, grid, data centers | Zijin, CMOC, Minmetals |
| **Lithium** | Batteries | Tianqi, Ganfeng, CATL |
| **Cobalt** | Batteries | CMOC (controls 70% of DRC output) |
| **Gold** | Reserves, de-dollarization | Zijin |
| **Nickel** | Batteries | Tsingshan, CATL |
| **Rare earths** | Domestic near-monopoly | Limited overseas need |
| **Uranium** | Nuclear buildout | CGN, CNNC |

## Deal flow acceleration

| Period | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| 2015-2018 | Peak BRI era — infrastructure + resources |
| 2019-2021 | COVID slowdown |
| 2022-2024 | Resumed — record commodity prices |
| **2025-2026** | **Accelerating — $10B+ in mining deals** |

**2026 so far:** Zijin-Allied ($4B) is largest Chinese overseas mining deal in years.

## Western response

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| CFIUS reviews (US) | Blocking some deals |
| Critical minerals lists | Prioritizing domestic supply |
| Friend-shoring | Redirecting to allies (Australia, Canada) |
| UFLPA sanctions | Zijin subsidiaries on forced labor list (2025) |
| Export controls | Limiting China's access to processing tech |

**Tension:** Western companies divesting African assets → Chinese buyers filling gap.

---

## Investment implications

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Chinese premium bids | Strategic value > financial value |
| African asset sales | Western majors exiting → Chinese entering |
| Lithium/copper deals | Battery supply chain priority |
| Gold accumulation | Reserve diversification play |

**For Western miners:** Chinese competition may support valuations but complicates geopolitics.

## Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Sanctions expansion** | US could target more Chinese miners |
| **Host country backlash** | Resource nationalism (Indonesia, DRC) |
| **Operational challenges** | Security, labor, infrastructure in Africa |
| **Overpayment** | Strategic premiums may destroy value |
| **Political risk** | Regime changes in host countries |
