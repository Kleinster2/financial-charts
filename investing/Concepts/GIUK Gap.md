**GIUK Gap** (Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap) — Strategic naval chokepoint controlling access between North Atlantic and Arctic/Norwegian Sea. Critical for submarine detection and naval interdiction.

---

## Geography

The gap spans three passages:

| Passage | Width | Depth |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Denmark Strait (Greenland-Iceland) | ~300 km | Shallow sections |
| Iceland-Faroe | ~400 km | Deep |
| Faroe-UK | ~300 km | Varies |

**Total width:** ~1,000 km of water to monitor.

## Strategic importance

### Cold War role
- Primary barrier against Soviet submarine breakout into Atlantic
- US/UK maintained SOSUS (underwater sensor arrays)
- NATO ASW (anti-submarine warfare) focus area
- Controlled access to Atlantic shipping lanes

### Current relevance

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Russian submarine activity | Increased since 2014 |
| Arctic opening | More traffic through northern routes |
| NATO expansion | Finland/Sweden add Baltic dimension |
| Undersea cables | Critical infrastructure passes through |

## Key assets

### NATO presence

| Location | Assets |
|----------|--------|
| **Iceland** | Keflavik — US/NATO air patrol base |
| **[[Greenland]]** | Pituffik — radar, early warning |
| **UK** | RAF maritime patrol, Royal Navy |
| **Faroe Islands** | Radar station |
| **Norway** | P-8 Poseidon aircraft |

### Surveillance systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| SOSUS (legacy) | Underwater acoustic arrays |
| IUSS | Integrated undersea surveillance |
| P-8 Poseidon | Maritime patrol aircraft |
| Satellites | Surface vessel tracking |

## Submarine dynamics

**Russian Northern Fleet** (Murmansk area) must transit GIUK Gap to reach Atlantic.

| Russian capability | NATO response |
|--------------------|---------------|
| SSBNs (ballistic missile subs) | Detection priority |
| SSNs (attack subs) | ASW patrols |
| Increased activity post-2014 | Renewed GIUK focus |

**Severodvinsk-class:** Russia's newest SSNs — quieter, harder to detect. Challenge for legacy sensors.

## Investment lens

Not directly investable as a concept, but relevant for:
- Defense contractors (ASW systems, maritime patrol)
- Undersea cable operators (route security)
- Iceland/Greenland strategic importance
- NATO defense spending allocation

**Beneficiaries:**
- [[Northrop Grumman]] — maritime surveillance
- [[Raytheon]] — sonar systems
- [[Boeing]] — P-8 Poseidon
