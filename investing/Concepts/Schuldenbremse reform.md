**Schuldenbremse reform** — Germany's 2025 overhaul of its constitutional debt brake, enabling ~€1T in borrowing for infrastructure and defense. Skeptics doubt it will meaningfully boost growth potential.

## What changed

The **Schuldenbremse** (debt brake), enshrined in Germany's constitution since 2009, previously restricted structural net borrowing to **0.35% of GDP**. In March 2025, Chancellor [[Germany|Friedrich Merz]]'s CDU/CSU-SPD coalition passed reforms creating two major exceptions:

| Exception | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure fund** | €500B over 12 years, outside debt brake |
| **Defense exemption** | Any spending above 1% GDP exempt from limits |

**Total firepower:** ~€850B in federal borrowing through 2029, inflating debt ~50% vs end-2024.

## Infrastructure fund breakdown

| Allocation | Amount | Guardrails |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Federal "additional" investment | €300B | Must be incremental to prior budget |
| States/municipalities | €100B | Weak — may plug budget holes |
| Climate fund | €100B | Includes electricity-grid fee subsidies |

**Investment trajectory:**

## The skeptic case

Deutsche Bank economist Sebastian Becker (Jan 2026): expects **no significant strengthening of real growth potential** — large parts of extra debt going to social spending and subsidies.

### Leakage mechanisms

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Budget shifting | Transport spending moved from core budget to infrastructure fund |
| Defense exemption | Frees core budget capacity for consumption |
| Weak guardrails | €100B to states may plug deficits, not invest |
| Social spending | Pension top-ups, commuter subsidies, restaurant VAT cuts |

**Quantified:** €125B minimum could pay for non-investment items through 2029 (Deutsche Bank estimate).

### 10% investment quota

Core budget must allocate 10% to investment to access new funds — meant to prevent budget games. Economists consider this **unambitious** and question calculation methodology.

## Growth outlook

Germany's real GDP has flatlined since 2019 — **six years of stagnation**. Potential output growth dropped to ~0.5%.

| Year | Bundesbank forecast |
|------|---------------------|
| 2026 | 0.9% |
| 2027 | 1.4% |

Deutsche Bank sees 2027 as **peak, not inflection** — growth partly reflects more working days, not structural improvement.

---

## Debt trajectory

| Year | Debt/GDP |
|------|----------|
| End-2024 | ~63% |
| 2035 (projected) | 85%+ |

German Council of Economic Experts warns government risks **"squandering"** the fiscal splurge on budget reallocations and consumptive expenditure.

---

## Why it matters

**Bull case:** Constitutional shackles removed. Germany can finally fix decrepit infrastructure, rearm properly, and end stagnation. Fiscal multiplier on genuine investment could be 1.5x+.

**Bear case:** Political economy unchanged. Coalition will divert funds to consumption (pensions, subsidies) to buy votes. Debt rises without commensurate GDP growth. AfD gains ammunition. Younger generations pay the bill.

**The test:** Watch the *composition* of spending, not just the totals. If 2027 growth fades and debt/GDP keeps climbing, skeptics were right.
