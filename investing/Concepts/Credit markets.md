## Spread chart

![[ig-vs-hy-spreads.png]]

*IG spreads (blue) near cycle lows at 76 bps despite massive TMT supply. HY (red) showing sharper widening — 265 → 297 bps in two weeks as AI disruption fears hit lower-quality credit. Divergence suggests stress is concentrated in weaker credits while IG absorbs supply.*

| Metric | Latest (Feb 5) | 2 weeks prior | Move |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------|
| IG OAS (BAMLC0A0CM) | 76 bps | 73 bps | +3 bps |
| HY OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2) | 297 bps | 265 bps | **+32 bps** |

|--------|------------------|-------|
| IG spreads | **78 bps** (Jan 8) | Below 90 bps since May 2025 |
| HY spreads | Compressed | Risk appetite strong |
| New issue concessions | Minimal | Demand > supply |

**"Barely any new issue concessions"** — JPMorgan (Jan 2026)

## "Everything bubble" thesis (Jan 2026)

**Mike Contopoulos** ([[Richard Bernstein Advisors]], deputy CIO):

**"We're kind of in an everything bubble at the moment. It's not just AI — it's crypto, it's meme stocks, it's [[SPAC]], it's IG credit, it's high-yield credit."**

| Driver | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Loose monetary policy | Fed balance sheet |
| Loose fiscal policy | Deficit spending |
| AI capex | **$440B** Big Tech spend (+34% YoY) |

### AI credit risk

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Asymmetric payoff | Credit investors don't benefit if AI booms |
| Obsolescence risk | 40-year bonds on 5-10 year tech |
| Capex funding | Much raised in debt markets |

**"What are investors really seeing in technology bonds where you're willing to fund 40-year debt on something that could be obsolete in five or 10 years?"**

### RBA positioning (Jan 2026)

| Asset class | Position | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Corporate credit | **Zero** | Was overweight 1yr ago |
| CLOs | Overweight | Spread pickup |
| MBS | Overweight | Relative value |
| European equities | Overweight | Fiscal + monetary support |
| Floating rate | Overweight | Rate hedge |

**"Nothing's better than high-quality European stocks. You get fiscal stimulus, monetary policy is reasonably supportive and earnings growth is accelerating."**

### Spread widening risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Fed slower to cut | Less easing than priced |
| Growth slowdown | Bigger than expected |

## February 2026 — AI credit stress emerges

*Source: Bloomberg Credit Weekly, Feb 7 2026*

### Software debt selloff

AI disruption fears hit credit markets directly for the first time:

| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Software leveraged loan prices | **-4% YTD** | Through Feb 6 |
| BDC equity index | **-4.6%** | Week of Feb 3 |
| BDC avg software exposure | >20% of portfolios | Barclays |
| Software share of IG/HY | ~3% each | Barclays |
| IG spread (Feb 6) | **75 bps** | Widened ~2 bps on week |

AI tools from [[Anthropic]] and others targeting professional services (finance, software dev) are causing investors to price in obsolescence risk for software companies.

### TMT bond supply surge

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] USD bond sale (Feb 9) | **$20B** (7 tranches, $100B+ orders) |
| [[Oracle]] single-day issuance (Feb 3) | **$25B** |
| JPMorgan TMT bond forecast (2026) | **$400B+** (could climb) |
| [[Morgan Stanley]] hyperscaler forecast (2026) | **$400B** (up from $165B in 2025) |
| [[Google]] 2026 capex guidance | **$185B** (>3 years combined) |
| [[Amazon]] 2026 capex guidance | **$200B** |
| High-grade bond inflows (week of Feb 4) | **$6.44B** (5-year high) |
| Global bond issuance | Hit **$1T** in record time |

Alphabet's deal is the largest tech bond offering in history. Longest USD tranche matures 2066 at ~95 bps over Treasuries (tightened from ~120 bps guidance). Also planning a sterling [[Century Bond]] — first tech century bond since [[Motorola]] 1997. See [[Hyperscaler bond issuance]] for the full deal tracker.

New issues underperformed JPMorgan US Liquid Index by 4 bps over prior 10 days — largest underperformance since October.

### Cash flow pressure (FT, Feb 8)

Big Tech capex now exceeding cash from operations — forcing bond/equity raises:

| Company | 2026 capex | Cash from ops (est.) | FCF gap |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| [[Amazon]] | $200B | $180B | **-$20B** |
| [[Meta]] | $135B | $130B | **-$5B** |
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] | $185B | $195B | +$10B (before buybacks). LT debt 4x to $46.5B in 2025 |

- [[Amazon]] filed regulatory notice signaling potential capital raise (debt or equity)
- [[Google\|Alphabet]] long-term debt: $10.9B (2024) → **$46.5B** (2025) — 4x in one year
- TD Securities expects **$80B** IG issuance week of Feb 10 (2x normal pace), driven by potential "mega deals" from Amazon, Meta, Alphabet
- US IG spreads widening in anticipation of Big Tech supply

BNP Paribas: FCF at Oracle, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta "plummeting toward negative territory" — only [[Microsoft]] appears "more resilient, at least for now."

### Notable deals (Feb 2026)

| Issuer | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [[Google\|Alphabet]] | $20B | 7-part USD sale + sterling [[Century Bond]] + CHF debut |
| [[Oracle]] | $25B | Monday single-day sale |
| Cipher Mining (for [[Amazon]] DC) | $2B | Junk bonds for data center |
| Stonepeak (BP Castrol) | $3.75B | May include junk tranche |
| Bank of America | $7B | IG multi-tranche |

### Key quotes

- "The AI spending bonanza is finding buyers today but leaves little upside and even less room for error" — Alexander Morris, F/m Investments
- "It doesn't take too many adverse events to create a selloff and for the prices to collapse" — Ali Meli, Monachil Capital Partners
- "Tight valuations make credit susceptible to potential disruption" — Barclays (Brad Rogoff, Dominique Toublan)

## [[AI infrastructure financing]]

Anticipated wave of bond issuance for:
- Data center construction
- GPU/chip procurement
- Power infrastructure
- [[Hyperscaler capex]]

See [[AI Infrastructure]], [[Data Centers]], [[Power constraints]]

## Why this matters for equities

| [[Signal]] | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Tight spreads | Risk-on, supports equity multiples |
| Heavy issuance | Companies locking in capex funding |
| AI bond surge | Validates infrastructure buildout thesis |
| Spread widening | Risk-off signal, watch for cracks |
