## "Everything bubble" thesis (Jan 2026)

**Mike Contopoulos** ([[Richard Bernstein Advisors]], deputy CIO):

**"We're kind of in an everything bubble at the moment. It's not just AI — it's crypto, it's meme stocks, it's SPACs, it's IG credit, it's high-yield credit."**

| Driver | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Loose monetary policy | Fed balance sheet |
| Loose fiscal policy | Deficit spending |
| AI capex | **$440B** Big Tech spend (+34% YoY) |

### AI credit risk

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Asymmetric payoff | Credit investors don't benefit if AI booms |
| Obsolescence risk | 40-year bonds on 5-10 year tech |
| Capex funding | Much raised in debt markets |

**"What are investors really seeing in technology bonds where you're willing to fund 40-year debt on something that could be obsolete in five or 10 years?"**

### RBA positioning (Jan 2026)

| Asset class | Position | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Corporate credit | **Zero** | Was overweight 1yr ago |
| CLOs | Overweight | Spread pickup |
| MBS | Overweight | Relative value |
| European equities | Overweight | Fiscal + monetary support |
| Floating rate | Overweight | Rate hedge |

**"Nothing's better than high-quality European stocks. You get fiscal stimulus, monetary policy is reasonably supportive and earnings growth is accelerating."**

### Spread widening risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Fed slower to cut | Less easing than priced |
| Growth slowdown | Bigger than expected |

## AI infrastructure financing

Anticipated wave of bond issuance for:
- Data center construction
- GPU/chip procurement
- Power infrastructure
- Hyperscaler capex

See [[AI Infrastructure]], [[Data Centers]], [[Power constraints]]

---

## Why this matters for equities

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Tight spreads | Risk-on, supports equity multiples |
| Heavy issuance | Companies locking in capex funding |
| AI bond surge | Validates infrastructure buildout thesis |
| Spread widening | Risk-off signal, watch for cracks |
