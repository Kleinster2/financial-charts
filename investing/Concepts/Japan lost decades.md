# Japan lost decades

The period from 1991 to ~2024 when [[Japan]]'s economy stagnated following the burst of the 1980s asset bubble. GDP growth hovered 0-2%, the [[Nikkei 225]] went 34 years without new highs, [[BOJ]] rates went negative, and persistent deflation reshaped consumer and corporate behavior. The Japanese term is **失われた30年** (*ushinawareta sanjūnen* — "lost 30 years").

## Causes

1. **Asset bubble burst (1990-91)**: Tokyo real estate and stock prices collapsed. Nikkei fell from 38,957 (Dec 1989) to ~14,000 by 1992
2. **Zombie banks**: Government and banks failed to write down bad loans aggressively. Banks kept lending to insolvent firms ("evergreening") rather than recognizing losses
3. **Balance sheet recession**: Corporates and households simultaneously deleveraged, destroying aggregate demand (per [[Richard Koo]]'s framework)
4. **Deflation trap**: Falling prices → deferred spending → lower demand → lower prices. Cash became the optimal asset
5. **Demographics**: Working-age population peaked in 1990, compounding the demand problem
6. **Policy failures**: BOJ too slow to cut rates. Fiscal stimulus was stop-start with premature tax hikes (1997 consumption tax increase worsened recession)

## Key data

| Metric | Bubble peak | Lost decades | 2026 |
|--------|------------|--------------|------|
| Nikkei 225 | 38,957 (1989) | 7,054 low (2009) | 58,000 |
| GDP growth | 6.7% (late 1980s) | 0-2% avg | ~1% |
| CPI | Rising | Zero or negative for 20+ years | ~3% |
| BOJ rate | 6% (1990) | 0% → negative (2016-2024) | 0.75% |
| 10Y JGB yield | ~8% (1990) | Negative (2016-2022) | Positive |

## Why it may be ending

The consensus is shifting: external shocks (Covid, Ukraine) broke the deflationary equilibrium by forcing companies to raise prices. Once CPI moved to ~3%, the entire economic logic flipped:
- Cash went from best to worst asset
- Savings must be deployed productively
- Wage-price spiral (positive this time) began
- [[BOJ]] could finally normalize rates

Combined with the [[Japan corporate governance revolution]], [[Warren Buffett]]'s signal, and political stability under [[Sanae Takaichi]], markets have decisively repriced Japan. The Nikkei trades at 16.2x P/E — fundamentally supported, unlike the 60x of 1989.

**Skeptics note**: economist Kasuo Mannma ([[Mizuho]]) argues Japan hasn't fully escaped — GDP growth remains anemic, demographics are worsening, and 240% debt/GDP constrains fiscal policy.

## Lessons for other economies

Japan's experience is studied as a warning for:
- **China**: faces similar demographics + real estate bust + deflationary pressure
- **Europe**: aging population + low growth parallels
- **US**: if deflation/secular stagnation had taken hold post-2008

[[Apollo]]'s [[Marc Rowan]] notes Japan is "the first of the Western democracies to face real aging, retirement, and high levels of government debt" — making it a template for what comes next elsewhere.
