# US-China tech competition in the Global South

The United States and [[China]] are competing to build — or block — the digital and physical infrastructure that will connect the developing world for the next generation. This is the defining tech-geopolitical contest of the 2020s, playing out across five domains: satellite internet, submarine cables, 5G/telecom, ports, and cloud/AI services.

China's approach: **build it, subsidize it, own the stack**. The US approach: **sanction, block, and occasionally offer alternatives**. The Global South is choosing based on who shows up with investment, not who shows up with threats.

## The five domains

### 1. Satellite internet

| Player | Constellation | Strategy |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| [[SpaceX]] / [[Starlink]] | 9,000+ sats, 42,000 target | Commercial dominance, 46% of Brazil's market |
| [[SpaceSail]] (China) | 108 sats, 15,000 target by 2030 | State-subsidized, Anatel-licensed in Brazil (Feb 2026), Telebras partnership |
| [[Amazon]] Kuiper | Testing phase, 3,236 target | Behind schedule |
| Guowang (China) | Planned, 13,000 target | Earlier stage, domestic/military focus |

SpaceSail is the first credible state-backed challenger to Starlink's global monopoly. Brazil licensed it in Feb 2026 — explicitly valuing a non-American alternative for "sovereign redundancy." See [[SpaceSail]] for full details.

### 2. Submarine cables

~95% of intercontinental data flows through undersea cables. China is building parallel networks:

- **Chile-China Express**: Chinese-built submarine cable connecting South America to Asia. US responded by sanctioning Chilean officials who approved it (see geopolitics vault: [[Chile-China Cable Sanctions]])
- **EMA (Europe-Middle East-Asia)**: $500M Chinese cable project to rival US-backed routes
- **HMN Technologies** (formerly Huawei Marine): Chinese cable builder blocked from multiple projects by US pressure (Australia, Pacific islands)
- **PEACE cable**: Chinese-backed cable connecting Pakistan to France via East Africa

The pattern: China builds, the US blocks, and countries in between must choose sides — or try to work with both.

### 3. 5G / Telecom

[[Huawei]] built 5G infrastructure across Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe — often at 30-50% lower cost than [[Ericsson]] or [[Nokia]]. US launched a global campaign to ban Huawei from allied networks:

- **Successes**: UK, Australia, Japan, most of EU removed or excluded Huawei
- **Failures**: Most of Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Middle East still use Huawei
- **Result**: De facto bifurcation of global telecom infrastructure

Per Atlantic Council (2025): "China's investment in ICT infrastructure in emerging markets is likely to provide significant advantages in AI" — Huawei is already integrating AI into e-government, smart cities, and cloud offerings sold to Global South governments.

### 4. Ports and logistics

China has built or operates ports across the developing world:

- **Chancay (Peru)**: Deep-water port built by COSCO, opened 2024. Largest Chinese port investment in Latin America
- **Colombo Port City (Sri Lanka)**: Chinese-built reclaimed island
- **Hambantota (Sri Lanka)**: 99-year lease to China after debt default
- **Djibouti**: China's first overseas military base, adjacent to commercial port
- **Piraeus (Greece)**: COSCO controls majority of Europe's gateway port
- **CK Hutchison (global)**: China-linked port operator removed from Panama Canal operations under US pressure (2025)

### 5. Cloud and AI services

- **Huawei Cloud**: Expanding across Africa and Southeast Asia with bundled AI services
- **Alibaba Cloud**: Presence in Southeast Asia, Middle East
- **Tencent Cloud**: Growing in ASEAN markets
- **US response**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud have government programs but often can't match Chinese pricing or willingness to customize for local needs

## Why China is winning (for now)

1. **Shows up with money, not threats.** China offers financing, builds infrastructure, and doesn't condition deals on governance reforms or human rights. The US offers sanctions against countries that buy Chinese tech.

2. **Price advantage.** State subsidies allow Chinese companies to underprice Western alternatives across every domain — Huawei 5G, SpaceSail satellite internet, submarine cables.

3. **Package deals.** China offers bundled infrastructure (port + 5G + cable + cloud) through BRI, creating lock-in. The US offers one-off alternatives without a coordinating framework.

4. **No strings attached.** Global South governments prefer partners who don't lecture about democracy. China's "non-interference" principle is more attractive than US conditionality.

5. **First-mover in many markets.** While the US debated, China built. Huawei's African 5G networks are already operational. SpaceSail is already licensed in Brazil. Chancay is already open.

## Why the US response falls short

- **Trump's Latin America approach**: coercion (tariffs, visa sanctions) rather than investment. See [[Trump Latin America Summit (March 2026)]] — conservative allies pledging loyalty while Brazil signs SpaceSail deals
- **"Rip and replace" is expensive**: telling countries to remove Huawei without funding alternatives doesn't work
- **No coordinated counter-offer**: US has Blue Dot Network, DFC, PGII but none match BRI's scale or speed
- **Sanctions fatigue**: overuse of sanctions (see [[Dollar reserve status erosion]]) drives countries toward Chinese alternatives

## Investment implications

**Winners (infrastructure providers):**
- [[SpaceSail]], [[Huawei]], Chinese cable builders — state-backed, expanding
- [[Starlink]] / [[SpaceX]] — still dominant but facing first real competition
- Neutral infrastructure suppliers (tower companies, spectrum managers, terminal manufacturers)

**Losers:**
- Pure US/European telecom equipment makers ([[Ericsson]], [[Nokia]]) losing Global South share
- Countries caught in the middle — forced to choose infrastructure stacks, risk sanctions from either side

**The macro view:**
This competition is building two parallel technology stacks for the planet — a US-aligned stack and a China-aligned stack. The Global South (4B+ people) will determine which stack wins through procurement decisions being made right now. The investment implication is that the "digital non-aligned movement" creates opportunities for companies that can serve both stacks.
