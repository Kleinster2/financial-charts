## EU approach vs US

| Dimension | EU | US |
|-----------|----|----|
| **Strategy** | Managed trade | Decoupling |
| **EV tariffs** | 7.8-35.3% → price floors | 100% (blocked) |
| **Tech restrictions** | Limited (follows US on semis) | Aggressive (Entity List) |
| **Investment screening** | Growing | CFIUS |
| **Tone** | "De-risking not decoupling" | Confrontational |

**Key difference:** EU preserves market access with conditions. US blocks entry.

## Key sectors

| Sector | EU concern | China response |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **EVs** | Subsidized competition | Price commitments |
| **Solar** | Dumping | Production shifted to SE [[Asia]] |
| **Steel** | Overcapacity | Diversified exports |
| **Tech** | Security | Limited retaliation |

## Investment implications

**For European OEMs:**
- Chinese EV competition continues (managed, not blocked)
- Cost/tech disadvantage persists
- VW, [[BMW]], Mercedes face margin pressure

**For Chinese exporters:**
- [[Europe]] accessible (unlike US)
- Must maintain price floors
- Growth path preserved
