Long-short equity — hedge fund strategy that buys undervalued stocks (long) and sells borrowed shares of overvalued stocks (short). The most common hedge fund strategy, representing ~30% of all hedge funds by count. Originated with Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, who created the first "hedged fund" by pairing long and short positions to reduce market exposure while isolating stock-picking skill (alpha).

## How it works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Long book | Buy stocks expected to appreciate |
| Short book | Borrow and sell stocks expected to decline |
| Net exposure | Long % minus short %; most managers run net long (e.g., 130/30 = 100% net long) |
| Gross exposure | Long % plus short %; measures total capital deployed |
| Alpha | Return from stock selection, independent of market direction |
| Beta | Market exposure retained in the portfolio |

The manager profits when longs outperform shorts regardless of market direction. In a down market, short gains can offset long losses.

## Variants

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Market neutral | Net exposure ~0%; pure alpha bet |
| Net long biased | Typical 40-70% net long; captures some market upside |
| Concentrated | 10-20 high-conviction positions per side (e.g., [[Totem Point]]) |
| Sector-focused | TMT, healthcare, financials specialists |
| Quantitative | Systematic factor-driven selection |

## Key metrics

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Net exposure | Directional market bet |
| Gross exposure | Leverage and total risk |
| Short ratio | Short book as % of gross |
| Alpha | Excess return vs. benchmark |
| Sharpe ratio | Risk-adjusted return |

## Advantages vs. long-only

- Can profit in falling markets
- Lower portfolio volatility (when hedged properly)
- Expanded opportunity set — can express negative views
- More liquid than most alternative strategies

---

## Risks

- Short squeeze — short positions can theoretically lose infinitely
- Borrowing costs eat into short-side returns
- Requires skill on both sides; most managers add alpha only on longs
- Higher fees (typical 2/20) and trading costs vs. long-only

---

## Disclosure via [[13F]]

[[SEC]] requires institutional managers with >$100M in [[13F]] securities to report long positions quarterly. Short positions are not disclosed on [[13F]], creating an asymmetric view of L/S fund portfolios.

- [[Tiger Global]] — Julian Robertson's lineage
- [[Totem Point]] — concentrated TMT L/S
