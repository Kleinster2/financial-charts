AI is becoming national security infrastructure:

| Country | Investment | Key Move |
|---------|------------|----------|
| [[Saudi PIF]] | $100B+ | a16z partnership |
| [[UAE G42]] | Billions | Falcon LLM, MSFT $1.5B |
| [[Japan Semiconductor Revival]] | $50B+ | Rapidus 2nm |
| [[India AI]] | $1.2B | 10K+ GPUs |
| [[Brazil AI]] | $4B | Clean energy angle |
| [[Israel Tech]] | Private | NVIDIA's "second home" |

## Why nations are investing

| Driver | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Economic competitiveness | AI = future GDP |
| National security | Defense AI |
| Data sovereignty | Own your data |
| Talent retention | Brain drain prevention |
| Strategic autonomy | Reduce US/China dependence |

## US-China alignment

**Countries must choose:**

| Aligned with US | Hedging | Aligned with China |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| UAE (post-Huawei divestment) | Brazil | — |
| Japan | India | — |
| Israel | Saudi Arabia | — |

G42 divested Huawei to get Microsoft deal.

## Compute sovereignty

**GPU access = power:**
- NVIDIA controls the spigot
- Export controls matter
- Countries stockpiling GPUs
- Domestic chip ambitions

---

## Investment implications

**Long NVIDIA:**
- Sells to everyone
- Kingmaker position
- Takes equity stakes (Nokia, Intel, AI21)

**Long local champions:**
- Rapidus (Japan)
- G42 ecosystem (UAE)
- Israeli startups (Hailo, AI21)

**Watch for:**
- Sovereign wealth fund deals
- NVIDIA strategic investments
- Domestic fab announcements

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Saudi AI fund | $100B+ |
| Japan chip investment | $50B+ |
| UAE's Falcon LLM | Open source |
| Brazil renewable grid | 93.6% |
