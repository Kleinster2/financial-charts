# Zero trust

Security architecture that eliminates implicit trust — every access request is authenticated, authorized, and continuously verified regardless of network location. Identity becomes the perimeter, replacing the old castle-and-moat model where anything inside the firewall was trusted.

Core principles: verify explicitly, use least privilege, assume breach.
