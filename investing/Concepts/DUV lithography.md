# DUV lithography

Deep ultraviolet lithography — 193nm/248nm wavelength. Workhorse of semiconductor manufacturing. Still produces **80% of all chips**. [[ASML]] dominates (~90%), with [[Nikon]] and [[Canon]] in niche segments.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Wavelength | 193nm (ArF), 248nm (KrF) |
| Market share (ASML) | ~90% |
| System cost | $5M - $90M |
| Practical limit | 7nm (with multi-patterning) |
| Volume share | **80% of all semiconductors** |

---

## Types

| Type | Wavelength | Use case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **ArF Immersion** | 193nm | Most advanced DUV, 28nm-7nm |
| **ArF Dry** | 193nm | Mid-nodes, less critical layers |
| **KrF** | 248nm | Mature nodes (65nm+), largest installed base |
| **i-line** | 365nm | Legacy, packaging |

**Immersion:** Water between lens and wafer increases effective numerical aperture, enabling finer features.

## Why still relevant

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Volume** | 80% of chips (automotive, industrial, IoT) |
| **Cost** | $5-90M vs $150-220M for EUV |
| **Mature nodes** | 28nm-180nm still huge market |
| **China** | Only option under export controls |
| **Non-critical layers** | Even 3nm chips use DUV for some layers |

## Market leaders

| Company | Share | Strength |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [[ASML]] | ~90% | ArF immersion dominance |
| [[Nikon]] | ~5% | ArF dry, precision |
| [[Canon]] | ~5% | i-line, KrF legacy |

ASML's dominance less absolute than EUV, but still overwhelming in advanced DUV (immersion).

## Key ASML systems

| System | Type | Throughput | Applications |
|--------|------|------------|--------------|
| **NXT:2100i** | ArF Immersion | Latest gen | Leading-edge DUV |
| **NXT:2050i** | ArF Immersion | 295 wph | 40nm resolution |
| **NXT:870B** | KrF Dry | 400 wph | Mature nodes |

---

## Multi-patterning

**Extends DUV to finer nodes via multiple exposures:**

| Technique | Exposures | Enables |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| SADP | 2x | 14nm-10nm |
| SAQP | 4x | 7nm |
| LELE | 2x | Various |

**Trade-off:** Each additional exposure = higher cost, lower yield, longer cycle time.

## China's DUV strategy

With EUV banned, China uses DUV multi-patterning for advanced nodes:

| Fab | Achievement | Method |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| [[SMIC]] | 7nm (Huawei Mate 60 Pro) | DUV multi-patterning |
| SMIC | 5nm (reported) | DUV, yield unknown |

**Limitations:**
- 7nm yields: 50-70% (vs TSMC 76% at launch)
- 5nm wafers: ~50% more expensive than TSMC equivalent
- 5nm appears to be practical DUV limit

---

## Domestic Chinese DUV

| Company | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **SMEE** | 90nm production, 28nm in development |
| **Yuliangsheng** | 28nm testing at SMIC |

Gap with ASML: reduced from ~20 years to several years, but still significant.

---

## Market size

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2024 | $15.4B |
| 2031E | $23.7B |
| CAGR | 6.4% |

ArF immersion fastest growing segment.
