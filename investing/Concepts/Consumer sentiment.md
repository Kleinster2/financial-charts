# Consumer sentiment

Survey-based measures of how households feel about current and future economic conditions. The two main US indices:

- **University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index** — monthly survey (~500 households), closely watched by markets. Measures current conditions and expectations.
- **Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index** — monthly survey (~3,000 households), emphasizes labor market conditions.

## 2025-2026 context

Consumer sentiment has diverged sharply from equity markets, a hallmark of the [[K-shaped economy]]:
- UMich sentiment crashed from ~72 (Jan 2025) to ~50 (Jan 2026) — near historic lows
- Meanwhile [[S&P 500]] hit new all-time highs above 6,800
- Sharp partisan gap: Republicans at 120 vs Democrats/Independents at 70 (Conference Board)
- Income gap: >$125K earners at 94.9 confidence vs <$15K at 55.4
