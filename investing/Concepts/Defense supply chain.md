**Defense supply chain** — Munitions production ramp and critical materials constraints. Ukraine depleted stockpiles; now the West is rebuilding at industrial scale, hitting material bottlenecks.

## The production gap

Ukraine war consumed munitions faster than the West could produce them. Replenishment requires a manufacturing base that atrophied after the Cold War.

| Region | Pre-war production | Target | Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| US (155mm shells) | 93K/yr | **1.2M/yr** | 2025 |
| EU (artillery) | 230K shells/yr | **3M shells/yr** | End of decade |
| US investment | — | **$5B** munitions factory upgrades | 2024-2026 |

**The math:** Ukraine fires ~7,000 shells/day. Pre-war Western production couldn't sustain that for a single front, let alone stockpile for Pacific contingencies.

## Artillery production ramp

### US

- Army investing $5B in new munitions plants
- Goal: 13x increase in 155mm production (93K → 1.2M/yr)
- New facilities in Texas, Iowa, Virginia
- Workforce challenge: skilled labor shortage in rural factory locations

### Europe

- EU targeting 3M shells/year by end of decade
- Current capacity fraction of target
- Rheinmetall building new plants in Germany, Lithuania, Ukraine
- Problem: fragmented procurement across 27 nations

## Critical materials

| Material | Defense use | Supply risk | Choke point |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Copper** | Munitions, electronics, wiring | China 40% smelting | 17-year mine timeline |
| **Rare earths** | Guidance systems, motors | China 60%+ processing | Few alternative sources |
| **Titanium** | Airframes, armor plate | Russia supply disrupted | Ukraine war irony |
| **Tungsten** | Armor-piercing rounds | China dominant | Few substitutes |
| **Antimony** | Ammunition primers, hardening | China 48% production | Export controls (Aug 2024) |

## Copper in weapons

Copper is **second-highest material by weight** in US defense production.

| Application | Copper use |
|-------------|------------|
| 155mm artillery shell | 0.5 kg each |
| Driving bands | Shell rotation/rifling |
| Shaped-charge liners | Anti-tank munitions (EFPs) |
| Bullet jackets | Small arms rounds |
| Missile guidance | Electronics, wiring harnesses |

**Scale problem:** At 1.2M shells/yr, US alone needs 600+ tonnes of copper annually just for artillery. Add missiles, electronics, naval vessels — defense copper demand is structurally rising into a supply-constrained market.

See [[Copper]] for broader supply constraints.

## Bottlenecks

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Propellant** | Single-source suppliers (BAE Radford plant) |
| **Machine tools** | Multi-year lead times for specialty lathes |
| **Skilled labor** | Workforce atrophied since Cold War |
| **Testing/certification** | 12-18 month qualification cycles |
| **Sub-tier suppliers** | Many sole-source, no surge capacity |

**Propellant bottleneck:** The US has effectively one major propellant plant (BAE's Radford, VA). Single point of failure for entire munitions industrial base.

## Missile production

Missiles are even more constrained than shells:

| Missile | Annual production | Backlog |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| Javelin | ~2,400/yr (target 4K) | Years |
| Stinger | Restarting (closed 2022) | — |
| HIMARS rockets | Ramping | 18+ months |
| Patriot (PAC-3) | ~500/yr | Years |

**L3Harris spinoff:** Spinning out missile business as public company (2026). DoD investing $1B. Signals government priority on missile production capacity.

## Investment implications

| Theme | Beneficiaries |
|-------|---------------|
| Shell production ramp | Rheinmetall, General Dynamics (Ordnance), Northrop |
| Missile capacity | [[L3Harris]] spinoff, RTX, Lockheed |
| Critical materials | [[Copper]] miners, rare earth processors |
| Machine tools | Specialty manufacturers |
| Propellant/explosives | BAE Systems, Chemring |

**The structural trade:** Defense supply chain buildout is a multi-year capex cycle. Unlike platforms (F-35, B-21), munitions are consumed and must be continuously replaced. Recurring revenue at industrial scale.
