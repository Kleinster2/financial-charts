**Margin of safety** — Buy below intrinsic value. Graham/Buffett principle. Protection against errors and uncertainty.

---

## Core principle

**Price paid determines returns, not quality alone.**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Intrinsic value | Estimated fair value |
| Purchase price | Entry point |
| Margin of safety | [[Gap]] between them |

---

## Why it matters

| Risk | Protection |
|------|------------|
| Valuation errors | Buffer for mistakes |
| Business deterioration | Downside cushion |
| Market volatility | Reduced drawdown |
| Unknown unknowns | General protection |

---

## Calculation approaches

| Method | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| DCF discount | Buy at 70% of DCF |
| Multiple discount | Buy below historical average |
| Asset value | Buy below liquidation |
| Earnings power | Price/normalized earnings |

---

## Required margin by quality

| Business quality | Required margin |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Wide moat, stable | 15-20% |
| Good business | 25-30% |
| Average business | 35-40% |
| Turnaround/speculative | 50%+ |

Higher uncertainty requires larger margin.

## Sources of margin of safety

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Market fear | Panic selling |
| Neglect | Underfollowed stocks |
| Complexity | Misunderstood situations |
| Short-term problems | Temporary earnings hit |
| Forced selling | Index rebalancing |

## When margin disappears

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| Buying at fair value | No buffer |
| Overpaying for quality | Valuation risk |
| Ignoring deterioration | Value trap |
| Thesis creep | Moving goalposts |

| 1 | Estimate intrinsic value range |
| 2 | Determine required margin |
| 3 | Set buy price |
| 4 | Wait for price |
