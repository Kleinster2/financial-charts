# China battery leverage

China's dominance in battery technology creates leverage over countries pursuing clean energy transitions. Tech transfer restrictions = geopolitical tool.

## The dynamic

| Factor | China position |
|--------|----------------|
| LFP cell technology | Dominant (cheapest, most proven) |
| Manufacturing scale | 80%+ global capacity |
| Cost advantage | Alternatives 30-50% more expensive |
| Tech transfer | Restricted by Beijing since ~2024 |

Countries cannot build independent battery supply chains without Chinese technology or accepting significantly higher costs.

## India case study — Jan 2026

All major Indian conglomerates failed to secure Chinese battery tech:

| Company | Status | Pivot |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Reliance Industries]] | Xiamen Hithium withdrew | BESS assembly |
| [[Adani Group]] | No cell manufacturing | BESS assembly |
| [[JSW Group]] | No cell manufacturing | BESS pilot only |
| Exide Industries | Chinese tech licensing | — |
| Amara Raja | Gotion High-Tech license | — |

**Why alternatives don't work:**
- Japanese, European, Korean tech assessed
- "Substantially more expensive and less competitive for large-scale deployment"
- Global battery overcapacity means cost is everything

**India market size:** 87 GW by 2035 (300x growth from 2024) — massive market that may remain dependent on Chinese cells.

### "Make in India" failure

| Metric | Plan | Reality |
|--------|------|---------|
| Subsidy pool | ₹181B ($2B) | — |
| Capacity target | 50 GWh | **1 GWh installed** |
| Achievement | — | **2%** |

### Import dependence growing

| Year | Total imports | From China |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 2018 | ~$0.4B | ~75% |
| 2025 | **$3B** | **75%** |

Imports grew 2.5x while domestic manufacturing failed to scale.

### Underlying R&D gap

India's inability to develop indigenous alternatives reflects decades of underinvestment:

| Country | R&D as % GDP (2023) |
|---------|---------------------|
| China | ~2.5% |
| India | ~0.6% (flat since 1996) |

## Beijing's calculus

Tech transfer curbs protect strategic advantage in clean energy:
- Battery cells = leverage over EV transitions
- Solar panels = similar dynamic
- Rare earth processing = similar dynamic

Pattern: China built dominance through scale + subsidies, now restricts tech export to maintain leverage.

## Investment implications

**If you need batteries at scale:**
- Pay China prices, or
- Pay 30-50% premium for non-Chinese tech, or
- Wait years to develop indigenous capability

**Winners:**
- Chinese battery makers (CATL, BYD, Hithium)
- Countries with existing Chinese partnerships

**Losers:**
- Countries pursuing "China-free" supply chains
- Companies that assumed tech licensing would be available
