**NYC real estate** — The world's most iconic property market. Defined by extreme supply constraints, regulatory burden, and persistent demand. Most expensive residential market in the US by median price.

---

## Why NYC real estate matters

| Characteristic | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| Global wealth magnet | Safe haven for capital |
| Extreme supply constraints | Zoning, landmarks, NIMBYism |
| Rent regulation | ~1M rent-stabilized units |
| High barrier to entry | Median condo >$1M |

NYC residential: 70% rental, 30% for-sale. Most for-sale is primary residence for actual New Yorkers.

## Market structure

### Ownership breakdown

| Segment | % of Market | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Rental buildings | ~70% | Owned by major landlords |
| For-sale (condos, co-ops, townhouses) | ~30% | Mostly primary residence |
| Foreign-owned (pied-à-terre) | Small | Much smaller than perception |

### Building types

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|
| **Co-op** | Own shares in corporation; board approval required; more restrictions |
| **Condo** | Own unit directly; easier to rent/sell; newer buildings |
| **Townhouse** | Single-family; rare; ultra-luxury segment |
| **Rental** | Majority of market; rent-stabilized or market-rate |

## Foreign buyer myth

Common belief: foreign buyers leaving units vacant drive up prices.

**Reality (per [[Ryan Serhant]], Jan 2026):**
- "Categorically false" today
- Was true during Obama years (2008-2016): cheap dollar attracted Canadians, French, Japanese, Chinese, South Americans
- Post-Obama: dollar strengthened → foreigners sold (20-50% currency gains)
- Most luxury trades now are wealthy New Yorkers buying primary residences

The *30 Rock* era (2006) of Saudi buyers outbidding locals is "long gone."

## What actually drives costs

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Lack of inventory** | Zoning, landmarks, community opposition |
| **Lack of incentive to build** | Regulatory burden, taxes, rent control risk |
| **High rates** | Increases cost of ownership → higher prices |
| **Blue state policy** | "Easier to punish success than incentivize creation" |

NYC exemplifies regulatory-induced scarcity. Permitting a new building can take 5+ years.

---

## Affordability paradox

Even at the luxury level, NYC buyers are stretched:

| Observation | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| "Most people live paycheck to paycheck in NYC" | [[Ryan Serhant]] |
| Even $3-5M condo buyers save very little | High cost + quality of living expectations |
| "I'll just make more money" mentality | Common across all price points |
| Buyers with $700K down often have no reserves | After 20-25% down payment |

The high cost of living forces a lifestyle-maximizing, savings-minimizing approach even among high earners.

### Fiscal burden on housing

NYC's overall fiscal trajectory compounds housing unaffordability. Property taxes already >27% of homeownership cost (2022), above the national average. [[Zohran Mamdani]]'s FY2026 budget proposes either further income/corporate tax hikes or a ~10% property tax increase. For full budget and tax data see [[New York City budget]].

City rental assistance spending: $263M (FY2020) → $1.34B (most recent FY) — a 5x increase. Housing costs worsened over the same period, consistent with subsidies bidding up prices rather than expanding supply.

[[Matt Yglesias]] argument: build abundant market-rate housing to expand the tax base and make the budget affordable. Supply-side, not subsidy-side.

## Key submarkets

| Area | Segment | Notable |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Manhattan** | Core luxury | Billionaire's Row (57th St), Tribeca, Upper East Side |
| **Brooklyn** | Premium/emerging | Dumbo, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights |
| **Queens** | Value/emerging | Long Island City, Astoria |
| **Bronx** | Affordable | South Bronx development |

---

## Rent regulation

~1 million rent-stabilized apartments in NYC. Political third rail.

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Rent stabilization | Limits annual increases; units exit market slowly |
| Good Cause Eviction (2024) | Expanded tenant protections statewide |
| 421-a expiration (2022) | Killed major tax incentive for new rental construction |

Regulation reduces supply and locks tenants in place, reducing inventory turnover.

## Market cycles

NYC residential is less cyclical than other markets due to:
- Persistent demand (global wealth, immigration)
- Supply constraints (can't overbuild)
- Safe haven status (capital flight destination)

But still affected by:
- Interest rates (current headwind)
- Financial sector employment (Wall Street bonuses)
- Tech sector presence (growing since 2010s)
- Migration patterns (COVID exodus, partial return)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- Permanent supply constraint (can't replicate Manhattan)
- Global wealth magnetism
- Infrastructure advantages (transit, culture)
- Dollar weakness benefits foreign buyers

**Bear:**
- Regulatory risk (rent control expansion)
- Crime/quality of life concerns (cyclical)
- Remote work reducing office-adjacent demand
- Blue state tax migration continues
