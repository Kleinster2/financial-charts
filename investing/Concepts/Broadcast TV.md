## Business model

### Revenue streams

| Source | % of revenue | Trend |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Advertising** | ~60% | Declining (cord-cutting) |
| **Retransmission fees** | ~30% | Growing (negotiating power) |
| **Content licensing** | ~10% | Varies |

### Retransmission fees

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Definition | Cable/satellite pay networks to carry signal |
| Per-sub fees | $2-4/month per subscriber |
| Total market | ~$12B annually |
| Leverage | Sports = "must carry" |

**Key dynamic:** Even as ratings fall, retrans fees rise because live sports force carriage.

---

## Affiliate structure

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **O&O** | Owned-and-operated by network | WCBS (NYC), KNBC (LA) |
| **Affiliate** | Independently owned, network programming | Local stations in smaller markets |

| Network | O&O stations | Affiliates |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| CBS | ~15 | ~200 |
| NBC | ~10 | ~200 |
| ABC | ~8 | ~200 |
| Fox | ~18 | ~200 |

**Economics:** O&Os more profitable (no affiliate fee split). Top 10 markets = most valuable.

---

## Sports: the broadcast lifeline

| Network | Key sports rights |
|---------|-------------------|
| **CBS** | NFL (AFC), March Madness, Masters |
| **NBC** | NFL (Sunday Night), Olympics, Notre Dame |
| **ABC** | NBA, College Football Playoff, ESPN simulcasts |
| **Fox** | NFL (NFC), World Series, World Cup 2026 |

**Reality:** Sports = only content that guarantees live mass audience. Everything else time-shifted.

---

## Broadcast vs cable vs streaming

| Attribute | Broadcast | Cable | Streaming |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Revenue model | Ads + retrans | Subs + ads | Subs + ads |
| Reach | 90%+ households | ~65M (declining) | 85%+ households |
| Cost to viewer | Free (antenna) | $100+/month | $8-20/month |
| Live sports | Yes (major) | Yes (ESPN, regional) | Growing |
| Trend | Stable-ish | Declining fast | Growing |

**Key insight:** Broadcast more resilient than cable because it's free and has sports.

---

## Ratings decline

| Metric | 2015 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Big Four primetime viewers | ~35M | ~20M | -43% |
| NFL on broadcast | Stable | Stable | Flat |
| Non-sports primetime | Declining | Declining fast | -50%+ |

**Pattern:** Sports flat, everything else collapsing.

---

## Streaming simulcasts

| Network | Streaming home | Strategy |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| CBS | [[Paramount Global\|Paramount+]] | Full simulcast + library |
| NBC | [[Comcast\|Peacock]] | Next-day + live sports |
| ABC | [[Disney\|Hulu]] | Next-day + live (some) |
| Fox | [[Fox Corporation\|Tubi]] | FAST focus, not simulcast |

**Tension:** Broadcast drives streaming subs but cannibalizes linear ratings.

---

## The CW (fifth network)

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Owners | Nexstar (75%), Paramount (remnant) |
| History | WB + UPN merger (2006) |
| Focus | Younger demos, genre shows |
| Status | Sold to Nexstar (2022), less relevant |

---

## Investment implications

| Position | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **[[Paramount Global]]** | CBS = crown jewel, NFL/March Madness |
| **[[Comcast]]** | NBC profitable, Olympics valuable |
| **[[Disney]]** | ABC integrated with ESPN strategy |
| **[[Fox Corporation]]** | Focused on broadcast + news |

**Key metric:** Retransmission fee growth vs ratings decline.
