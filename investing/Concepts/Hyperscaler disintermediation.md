**Hyperscaler Disintermediation** — Google, Meta, Microsoft building their own infrastructure, bypassing telecoms.

---

## The thesis

Hyperscalers are vertically integrating connectivity:

| Year | Hyperscaler-owned cables |
|------|--------------------------|
| 2017 | 20 |
| 2024 | 59 |
| Trend | Accelerating |

Telecoms losing long-haul traffic to direct hyperscaler infrastructure.

---

## Why hyperscalers build their own

| Factor | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Control | No consortium politics |
| Capacity | Dedicated bandwidth |
| Cost | Cheaper long-term |
| Latency | Optimized routes |
| Security | Own infrastructure |

---

## Evidence

**Meta's Project Waterworth:**
- 50,000 km cable
- 100% Meta-owned
- Longest ever, single owner
- No telecom involvement

**Google:**
- Pacific Connect (42,500 km)
- Humboldt, Echo, Apricot
- Building global network

---

## What telecoms keep

| Layer | Who wins |
|-------|----------|
| Long-haul submarine | Hyperscalers |
| Metro fiber | Still telecoms |
| Last mile (consumer) | Still telecoms |
| Enterprise connectivity | Mixed |
| Wireless (5G/6G) | Telecoms + [[Nokia]] |

Telecoms retain local connectivity, lose intercontinental.

---

## Telecom response

**Pivot strategies:**

| Company | Response |
|---------|----------|
| [[Telefónica]] | Telxius operates cables for hyperscalers |
| [[T-Mobile]] | AI-RAN with Nokia/NVIDIA |
| [[Vodafone]] | Consortium partner (Amitié) |
| [[AT&T]]/[[Verizon]] | Fiber buildout, enterprise |

Become hyperscaler partners, not competitors.

## Investment implications

**Short telecoms long-haul:**
- Hyperscalers taking traffic
- Lower wholesale revenue
- Commodity pricing

**Long telecom local:**
- Last mile still valuable
- Enterprise connectivity
- 5G/6G networks
- Can't be disintermediated (yet)

**Long hyperscalers:**
- [[Google]], [[Meta]] building infra
- Capex now, lower costs later
- Strategic control

---

## The AI accelerant

**Why AI accelerates this:**
- Massive data flows between DCs
- Training requires bandwidth
- Hyperscalers need control
- Can't depend on third parties

AI = more reason to own infrastructure.

---

## Counter-thesis

**Why telecoms survive:**
- Regulatory protection
- Spectrum licenses (wireless)
- Local relationships
- Enterprise trust
- AI-RAN opportunity

Wireless 5G/6G = telecom's defensible moat.

---

## Key actors

**Winners:**
- [[Google]] — Pacific Connect, cables
- [[Meta]] — Waterworth, cable empire
- [[Nokia]] — AI-RAN, telecom enabler
- [[NVIDIA]] — AI-RAN chips

**Adapters:**
- [[T-Mobile]] — AI-RAN partner
- [[Telefónica]] — Infrastructure operator

**At risk:**
- Wholesale-focused telecoms
- Long-haul pure plays

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hyperscaler cables | 59 (3x since 2017) |
| Longest single-owner | 50,000 km (Meta) |
| AI driver | Data center traffic |
| Telecom defense | Wireless, last mile |
