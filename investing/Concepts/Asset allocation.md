## Firm positioning (Jan 2026)

### [[Richard Bernstein Advisors]] — Jan 8, 2026

| Asset | Position | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| US corporate credit | **Zero** | Was overweight 1yr ago |
| CLOs | Overweight | Spread pickup |
| MBS | Overweight | Relative value |
| European equities | **Overweight** | Top conviction |
| Floating rate | Overweight | Rate hedge |

**View:** "Everything bubble" — defensive positioning.

### [[Goldman Sachs]] (Ben Snider team) — Jan 6, 2026

| Sector | Position | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Health care | Overweight | Valuation + profitability |
| Materials | Overweight | Cycle play |
| Consumer discretionary | **Overweight** | Middle income focus |
| Software & services | Overweight | Ex-Mag 7 tech |

**Consumer picks** — "nice to have" over "need to have":

| Stock | Category |
|-------|----------|
| Burlington Stores | Apparel |
| Best Buy | Electronics |
| Five Below | Discount |
| Levi Strauss | Apparel |
| Gap | Apparel |
| Dick's Sporting Goods | Sporting goods |

**Thesis:** Middle income consumers will see real income growth acceleration → improved sales growth. Tailwinds: fading tariffs, stable labor market, tax rebates.

**View:** Rotation within equities, not out of them. Value over growth.

### [[Goldman Sachs]] (Christian Mueller-Glissmann team) — Jan 8, 2026

| View | H1 2026 | H2 2026 |
|------|---------|---------|
| Equities | **Overweight** | Cautious (recession risk) |
| Stance | Growth-driven | Bear market risk |

**Valuation concern:**

| Metric | S&P 500 | [[MSCI]] World ex-US | Premium |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 22x | ~16x | **36%** |
| Historical avg | ~17x | ~14x | — |

**2025 returns:** S&P 500 +16% vs [[MSCI]] World ex-US **+29%** (international outperformed)

**Recommendation:** Diversify across regions, sectors, styles. Performance should broaden beyond AI capex to AI adoption beneficiaries and economic growth beneficiaries.
