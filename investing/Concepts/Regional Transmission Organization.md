**Regional Transmission Organization** (RTO) — federally authorized entity that coordinates electricity transmission, operates wholesale power markets, and ensures grid reliability across a multi-state region. An ISO (Independent System Operator) performs the same function; the terms are largely interchangeable.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Authority | [[FERC]] Orders 888 (1996) and 2000 (1999) |
| US RTOs/ISOs | 7 (covering ~2/3 of US electricity) |
| Core functions | Dispatch, market operation, reliability, interconnection queue |
| Key market type | [[Capacity market]] (ensuring future supply) |

## US RTOs and ISOs

| Operator | Region | Notable |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **[[PJM]]** | Mid-Atlantic, Midwest | Largest — 65M people, 13 states + DC |
| **MISO** | Central US | Wind integration leader |
| **ERCOT** | Texas | Energy-only market, deliberately isolated from federal oversight |
| **CAISO** | California | Solar integration, duck curve |
| **NYISO** | New York | Congested, high prices |
| **ISO-NE** | New England | Gas dependence |
| **SPP** | Plains | Wind surplus |

~1/3 of the US (mostly Southeast) has no RTO — utilities self-dispatch under bilateral contracts.

## Why RTOs matter for investors

RTOs control the interconnection queue — the bottleneck determining how fast new generation and [[Data Centers|data centers]] can connect to the grid. Their auction designs set the price of capacity and their queue backlogs create the [[Power infrastructure bottleneck]].

- **[[PJM]]'s 60 GW shortfall warning** (Feb 2026) is the most concrete quantification of the supply gap
- [[FERC]] regulates RTO market design — reform pace directly affects queue clearing times
- Shift from 12-month to 10-year [[Capacity market|capacity contracts]] would restructure generator economics
