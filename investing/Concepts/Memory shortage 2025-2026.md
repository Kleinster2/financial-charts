#concept #memory #shortage #2025 #2026

Severe DRAM/NAND shortage driving prices up — and availability may become the bigger issue.

---

## The situation

- Spot and contract prices rising for multiple quarters
- Price increases "far from over"
- Risk: memory becomes **unavailable**, not just expensive
- Affects: computers, servers, mobile devices, all systems

---

## Three drivers

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Limited capacity additions** | No major new fabs coming online into 2026 |
| **HBM wafer allocation** | DRAM wafers converted to HBM → squeezes commodity DRAM |
| **Cleanroom constraints** | Big 3 can't expand fast enough |

Plus: [[Export controls]] prevent China fabs from expanding.

---

## Wafer conversion dynamics

```
DRAM wafers → HBM (for AI)
NAND wafers → DRAM (to backfill)
```

AI demand for HBM is cannibalizing commodity memory supply. Structural, not cyclical.

---

## Who benefits

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| [[SK Hynix]] | HBM leader + DRAM pricing power |
| [[Samsung]] | Memory margins improve |
| [[Micron]] | Same dynamics |

Memory profits fund other bets (foundry, packaging).

---

## Who loses

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Consumer electronics OEMs | Higher BoM costs |
| PC/smartphone makers | Price increases or spec downgrades |
| End consumers | Pay more, get less |

---

## Partial offset

Weak consumer electronics demand could ease shortage — but only partially. AI/server demand remains strong.

---

## Timeline

- Q3-Q4 2025: Sharp price increases
- 2026: Shortage continues, panic buying
- 2027: Supply remains tight — no relief expected
- New fabs take 2-3 years to build

## FT/TrendForce data (Jan 2026)

**Pricing:**
- TrendForce: DRAM prices +50-55% QoQ in Q4 2025
- Samsung raised some chip prices 60%
- Consumer electronics prices expected to rise 5-20%

**Capacity:**
- Samsung/SK Hynix 2026 orders already exceed capacity
- Supply tight until 2027 — no additional capacity expected
- SK Hynix $91B chipmaking cluster (announced 2024) — years away

**Demand:**
- Big tech AI infra spend: $620B in 2026 (up from $470B in 2025)
- Morgan Stanley: $2.9T AI datacenter spend by 2028
- "Panic buying" — buyers scrambling regardless of price

**OEM warnings:**
- Dell COO: "never seen costs move at the rate" they're rising
- Lenovo: stockpiling memory chips
- Raspberry Pi: "painful" cost pressures, raised prices Dec 2025
- Xiaomi: 2026 supply chain pressures "far greater than" 2025

**Analyst quote (Macquarie):**
> "The market is crazy with buyers in panic as they struggle to secure enough memory no matter how much they are willing to pay."

## Micron confirmation (Dec 2025)

From Q1 FY26 earnings:

> "Largest ever seen supply-demand gap"
> "Only meeting 50-67% of demand from key customers"
> "Tightness to persist through and beyond CY2026"

**Hard numbers:**
- DRAM ASP +20% q/q
- CY26 HBM fully contracted (price AND volume)
- CY26 industry bit shipment growth ~20% (supply constrained)
- GM expanding: 56.8% → 68% guided
- HBM TAM: $35B (2025) → $100B (2028)

This is as strong a confirmation as you'll get — direct from management.

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

**Bullish Korea:**
- Memory shortage = pricing power
- SK Hynix and Samsung margins expand
- Profits fund foundry/packaging expansion
- [[Export controls]] add to supply constraint

This compounds with the VEU revocation news — Korea memory in strong position.

## Counterpoint smartphone forecast (Jan 2026)

**Dramatic revision — memory shortage crushing smartphone outlook:**

| Metric | Previous | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 2026 shipment growth | +0.45% | **-2.1%** |
| 2025 shipment growth | +3.3% | +3.3% |
| ASP increase (2026) | — | **+6.9%** |
| Component cost increase | — | +10-25% |

**OEM forecast revisions (Nov → Jan 2026):**

| OEM | Nov Forecast | Jan Forecast | Revision |
|-----|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Apple | -0.5% | -1% | -0.5pp |
| Samsung | -0.5% | -2% | **-1.5pp** |
| Xiaomi | 0% | -2% | **-2pp** |
| Vivo | +1% | -1% | **-2pp** |
| Oppo | +2% | -1% | **-3pp** |
| Honor | -2% | -4% | **-2pp** |
| Others | +2% | -2% | **-4pp** |
| **Overall** | +0.5% | -2.1% | **-2.6pp** |

**Takeaway:** Others (-4pp) and Oppo (-3pp) hit hardest. Samsung revised more than Apple (-1.5pp vs -0.5pp) — less margin buffer than expected. Apple best positioned.

**Key dynamics:**
- AI buildout causing producers to prioritize HBM over commodity DRAM
- Entry-level smartphones hit hardest (lower margins can't absorb costs)
- OEM responses: push premium models, reuse old components, downgrade specs
- Lenovo/Xiaomi already stockpiling memory
- Nintendo Switch 2 also impacted (shares down most of December)

**Analyst quote (Counterpoint):**
> "Apple and Samsung are best-positioned to weather the next few quarters. But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins."

## China OEM forecast cuts (Jan 21, 2026)

**Concrete unit cuts — memory shortage forcing dramatic revisions:**

| OEM | 2026 forecast cut | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| **[[Xiaomi]]** | **-70M units** | Largest China smartphone maker |
| **Transsion** | **-45M units** | Africa/emerging markets leader |

**Combined: 115M fewer smartphones** than previously forecast.

These are among the sharpest single-company revisions of the shortage — confirms memory availability (not just price) is the binding constraint.

## Korea supplier response (Jan 2026)

**Samsung and SK Hynix ramping capacity but demanding higher prices:**

| Supplier | 2026 plans |
|----------|------------|
| **[[Samsung]]** | ~50% capacity expansion |
| **[[SK Hynix]]** | 4x investment vs previous |
| **Both** | Seeking **+70% server DRAM price hikes** |
| **Stargate** | 900K DRAM wafers/month committed |

**Equipment spending:** Korea back to #2 globally ($29.66B, +27.2% YoY).

**New fabs:**
- SK Hynix M15X (Cheongju) — starting early (Feb 2026)
- Samsung P5 (Pyeongtaek) — operational 2028
- SK Hynix Yongin cluster — world's largest HBM hub by 2027

**HBM4 launch:** February 2026 (SK Hynix 16-layer).

Despite expansion, shortage expected to persist through 2027 — capacity takes 2-3 years to come online.
