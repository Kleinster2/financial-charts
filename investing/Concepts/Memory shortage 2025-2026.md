#concept #memory #shortage #2025 #2026

Severe DRAM/NAND shortage driving prices up — and availability may become the bigger issue.

---

## The situation

- Spot and contract prices rising for multiple quarters
- Price increases "far from over"
- Risk: memory becomes unavailable, not just expensive
- Affects: computers, servers, mobile devices, all systems

---

## Three drivers

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Limited capacity additions | No major new fabs coming online into 2026 |
| HBM wafer allocation | DRAM wafers converted to HBM → squeezes commodity DRAM |
| Cleanroom constraints | Big 3 can't expand fast enough |

Plus: [[Export controls]] prevent [[China]] fabs from expanding.

---

## Wafer conversion dynamics

```
DRAM wafers → HBM (for AI)
NAND wafers → DRAM (to backfill)
```

AI demand for HBM is cannibalizing commodity memory supply. Structural, not cyclical.

---

## Who benefits

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| [[SK Hynix]] | HBM leader + DRAM pricing power |
| [[Samsung]] | Memory margins improve |
| [[Micron]] | Same dynamics |
| [[Nanya Technology]] | DDR4 pricing inversion, +851% 1yr |
| [[Winbond Electronics]] | Dual NOR + DDR4 exposure, +648% 1yr |
| [[Macronix]] | NOR flash shortage, +383% 1yr |

Memory profits fund other bets (foundry, packaging). Taiwan specialty memory makers are the surprise beneficiaries — as Big Three exit commodity DRAM for [[HBM]], [[Nanya Technology]] and [[Winbond Electronics]] inherit DDR4 pricing power.

---

## Who loses

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| [[Consumer]] electronics OEMs | Higher BoM costs |
| PC/smartphone makers | Price increases or spec downgrades |
| End consumers | Pay more, get less |

---

## Partial offset

Weak consumer electronics demand could ease shortage — but only partially. AI/server demand remains strong.

---

## Timeline

- Q3-Q4 2025: Sharp price increases
- 2026: Shortage continues, panic buying
- 2027: Supply remains tight — no relief expected
- New fabs take 2-3 years to build

---

## FT/[[TrendForce]] data (Jan 2026)

Pricing:
- [[TrendForce]]: DRAM prices +50-55% QoQ in Q4 2025
- Samsung raised some chip prices 60%
- [[Consumer]] electronics prices expected to rise 5-20%

Capacity:
- Samsung/SK Hynix 2026 orders already exceed capacity
- Supply tight until 2027 — no additional capacity expected
- SK Hynix $91B chipmaking cluster (announced 2024) — years away

Demand:
- Big tech AI infra spend: $620B in 2026 (up from $470B in 2025)
- [[Morgan Stanley]]: $2.9T AI datacenter spend by 2028
- "Panic buying" — buyers scrambling regardless of price

OEM warnings:
- [[Dell]] COO: "never seen costs move at the rate" they're rising
- [[Lenovo]]: stockpiling memory chips
- Raspberry Pi: "painful" cost pressures, raised prices Dec 2025
- Xiaomi: 2026 supply chain pressures "far greater than" 2025

Analyst quote (Macquarie):
> "The market is crazy with buyers in panic as they struggle to secure enough memory no matter how much they are willing to pay."

---

## Micron confirmation (Dec 2025)

From Q1 FY26 earnings:

> "Largest ever seen supply-demand gap"
> "Only meeting 50-67% of demand from key customers"
> "Tightness to persist through and beyond CY2026"

Hard numbers:
- DRAM ASP +20% q/q
- CY26 HBM fully contracted (price AND volume)
- CY26 industry bit shipment growth ~20% (supply constrained)
- [[GM]] expanding: 56.8% → 68% guided
- HBM TAM: $35B (2025) → $100B (2028)

This is as strong a confirmation as you'll get — direct from management.

---

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

Bullish Korea:
- Memory shortage = pricing power
- SK Hynix and Samsung margins expand
- Profits fund foundry/packaging expansion
- [[Export controls]] add to supply constraint

This compounds with the VEU revocation news — Korea memory in strong position.

## Counterpoint smartphone forecast (Jan 2026)

Dramatic revision — memory shortage crushing smartphone outlook:

| Metric | Previous | Revised |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 2026 shipment growth | +0.45% | -2.1% |
| 2025 shipment growth | +3.3% | +3.3% |
| ASP increase (2026) | — | +6.9% |
| Component cost increase | — | +10-25% |

OEM forecast revisions (Nov → Jan 2026):

| OEM | Nov Forecast | Jan Forecast | Revision |
|-----|--------------|--------------|----------|
| [[Apple]] | -0.5% | -1% | -0.5pp |
| Samsung | -0.5% | -2% | -1.5pp |
| Xiaomi | 0% | -2% | -2pp |
| [[Vivo]] | +1% | -1% | -2pp |
| [[Oppo]] | +2% | -1% | -3pp |
| [[Honor]] | -2% | -4% | -2pp |
| Others | +2% | -2% | -4pp |
| Overall | +0.5% | -2.1% | -2.6pp |

Takeaway: Others (-4pp) and [[Oppo]] (-3pp) hit hardest. Samsung revised more than [[Apple]] (-1.5pp vs -0.5pp) — less margin buffer than expected. [[Apple]] best positioned.

Key dynamics:
- AI buildout causing producers to prioritize HBM over commodity DRAM
- Entry-level smartphones hit hardest (lower margins can't absorb costs)
- OEM responses: push premium models, reuse old components, downgrade specs
- [[Lenovo]]/Xiaomi already stockpiling memory
- [[Nintendo]] [[Switch]] 2 also impacted (shares down most of December)

Analyst quote (Counterpoint):
> "[[Apple]] and Samsung are best-positioned to weather the next few quarters. But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins."

## [[China]] OEM forecast cuts (Jan 21, 2026)

Concrete unit cuts — memory shortage forcing dramatic revisions:

| OEM | 2026 forecast cut | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| [[Xiaomi]] | -70M units | Largest [[China]] smartphone maker |
| Transsion | -45M units | [[Africa]]/emerging markets leader |

Combined: 115M fewer smartphones than previously forecast.

These are among the sharpest single-company revisions of the shortage — confirms memory availability (not just price) is the binding constraint.

---

## Korea supplier response (Jan 2026)

Samsung and SK Hynix ramping capacity but demanding higher prices:

| Supplier | 2026 plans |
|----------|------------|
| [[Samsung]] | ~50% capacity expansion |
| [[SK Hynix]] | 4x investment vs previous |
| Both | Seeking +70% server DRAM price hikes |
| Stargate | 900K DRAM wafers/month committed |

Equipment spending: Korea back to \#2 globally ($29.66B, +27.2% YoY).

New fabs:
- SK Hynix M15X (Cheongju) — starting early (Feb 2026)
- Samsung P5 (Pyeongtaek) — operational 2028
- SK Hynix Yongin cluster — world's largest HBM hub by 2027

HBM4 launch: February 2026 (SK Hynix 16-layer).

Despite expansion, shortage expected to persist through 2027 — capacity takes 2-3 years to come online.

## Supercycle framing (Jan 2026)

[[Wall Street consensus]]: This is no longer a temporary shortage — it's a structural supercycle.

| Analyst | 2026 forecast |
|---------|---------------|
| [[Bank of America]] | "Supercycle similar to 1990s boom" |
| BoA DRAM revenue | +51% YoY |
| BoA NAND revenue | +45% YoY |
| WSTS global semi | $975B (+26%) |
| BoA global semi | $1T+ (+30%) |
| [[IDC]] | "Unprecedented" shortage, may persist to 2027 |
| [[Counterpoint Research]] | Memory prices +40% through Q2 2026 |

Nov 2025 monthly sales: $75.3B — all-time record (+29.8% YoY).

## Qualcomm Q1 FY2026 confirmation (Feb 4, 2026)

Direct from earnings call — memory shortage now affecting guidance:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q2 guidance | $10.2B-$11.0B (below $11B Street) |
| Cause | Memory shortage constraining OEMs |
| Duration | "Can't predict if this continues for '27 or '28" |
| China OEMs | Reducing build plans, cutting channel inventory |

CEO Amon confirmed memory is now binding constraint on handset volumes through FY2026. Stock fell 8.5% despite Q1 beat.

Key quote: OEM customers "reducing build plans and channel inventory" — not just higher costs, but actual capacity constraints preventing production.

---

## China memory makers abandon low-price strategy (Feb 2026)

The "China will flood the market with cheap memory" narrative is dead.

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| CXMT dumping DDR4 at deep discounts | Denied by CXMT — market speculation |
| Chinese DRAM will undercut Korea | Prices converging toward Korean levels |
| YMTC NAND will be cheap alternative | Also not underpricing contract rates |

Why China can't be the cheap alternative:

| Constraint | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| No EUV access | CXMT DDR5 dies are 40-50% larger than SK Hynix — higher cost per chip |
| DUV workarounds | SAQP, aggressive binning, higher voltages — works but doesn't scale |
| No ecosystem trust | Apple, HP, Dell won't buy unproven modules without extensive validation |
| Regulatory walls | YMTC on Entity List (Dec 2022); CXMT flagged under Section 1260H |
| Domestic demand absorbs supply | CXMT capacity serves China alone — no surplus for export |

Strategic pivot: CXMT moving from DDR4 → DDR5/LPDDR5X production. Not trying to win on price — trying to serve China's domestic AI/datacenter buildout.

Investment implication: Bullish SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron. Chinese competition won't pressure memory pricing through 2026-2027. Supply stays tight, margins stay healthy.

*Combined hyperscaler capex (Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle) expected to top $650B in 2026 — up from ~$217B in 2024. Source: Bloomberg.*

### Price dynamics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DRAM price spike (Dec→Jan) | +75% (one type) |
| DRAM share of low-end smartphone BoM | 10% (early 2025) → 30% (projected) |
| Falcon Northwest custom PC ASP increase | +$1,500 to ~$8,000 |
| Samsung contract review frequency | Annual → quarterly |

### Corporate warnings and actions

| Company | Warning |
|---------|---------|
| [[Tesla]] / [[Elon Musk]] | "We've got two choices: hit the chip wall or make a fab" — considering building own memory fab |
| [[Apple]] / Tim Cook | Will compress iPhone margins |
| [[Micron]] | "Unprecedented" bottleneck |
| [[Lenovo]] / Yang Yuanqing | "Structural imbalance... not simply a short-term fluctuation" — at least through rest of 2026 |
| [[Cisco]] | Cited memory squeeze for weak profit outlook — worst share loss in 4 years |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Warned of more fallout ahead |
| [[Arm]] | Warned of more fallout ahead |
| [[Arista Networks]] / Ullal | "Memory is now the new gold for the AI and automotive sector" |
| [[Lam Research]] / Archer | "What is ahead of us between now and the end of this decade... will overwhelm all other sources of demand" |

### Gaming console impact

| Company | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| [[Sony]] | Considering pushing PS6 debut to 2028 or 2029 (from planned ~2027) |
| [[Nintendo]] | Contemplating raising [[Switch]] 2 price in 2026 |

### Chinese OEM shipment cuts (additional)

| Company | Action |
|---------|--------|
| [[Oppo]] | Cutting 2026 forecast by up to 20% |
| [[Xiaomi]] | Trimming shipment targets |
| Transsion | Trimming shipment targets |

### Root cause math

Each [[NVIDIA]] NVL72 rack-scale system uses 13.4 TB of RAM — enough memory for ~1,000 high-end smartphones or a few hundred PCs. [[HBM]] demand +70% YoY in 2026 ([[TrendForce]]). HBM takes 23% of total DRAM wafer output in 2026 (up from 19% in 2025).

### Hyperscaler capex driving demand

| Year | Big 4 capex |
|------|-------------|
| 2024 | $217B |
| 2025 | ~$360B |
| 2026E | ~$650B |

[[Alphabet]] + [[Amazon]] alone: $185B + $200B in 2026 — more than any company in history.

### Micron Crucial brand discontinued

[[Micron]] ended its popular Crucial brand of consumer memory sticks after 30 years — triggered "stampede" to secure inventory, driving prices to new highs.

### Super-cycle confirmation

[[Micron]] EVP Bhatia: "This is the most significant disconnect between demand and supply in terms of magnitude as well as time horizon that we've experienced in my 25 years in the industry." Growing view that industry is in a "super-cycle" — wave of AI adoption so vast it's eradicating the memory sector's decades-long boom-bust cycle.

Bernstein analyst Mark Li: memory chip prices going "parabolic."

### Supply gap

[[GF Securities]]: 4% gap between DRAM supply and demand, 3% for NAND — but doesn't yet factor low inventories, so actual imbalance likely bigger.
