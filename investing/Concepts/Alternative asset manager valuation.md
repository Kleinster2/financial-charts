**Alternative asset manager valuation** — Alt asset managers are valued on **fee revenue multiples (10-20x)**, not AUM. The $100B+ headline AUM belongs to LPs — the manager only earns ~1% management fee + 20% carried interest on profits. This explains why [[DigitalBridge]] ($108B AUM) sold for $4B and [[Blackstone]] ($1.2T AUM) has a $120B market cap.

## The core insight

**AUM ≠ value.** Asset managers don't own the assets — they manage them for limited partners.

| What they have | What they earn |
|----------------|----------------|
| $100B AUM | ~$1B management fees (~1%) |
| Good performance | ~20% of profits (carried interest) |
| Permanent capital | Higher fee stability |

**Valuation = fee stream × multiple**, not AUM × percentage.

## Valuation benchmarks

| Firm | AUM | FEEUM | Market Cap | Multiple to AUM | Multiple to Fee Rev |
|------|-----|-------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [[Blackstone]] | $1.24T | $906B | ~$120B | ~10% | **15-20x** |
| [[KKR]] | $723B | $585B | ~$120B | ~17% | **12-15x** |
| [[Apollo]] | $700B+ | — | ~$90B | ~13% | **13x** |
| [[Brookfield]] | $1T+ | — | ~$85B | ~8% | **12-15x** |
| [[Blue Owl]] | $235B | — | ~$35B | ~15% | **15x** |
| [[DigitalBridge]] | $108B | $41B | ~$2.8B* | ~2.6% | **~10x** |

*Pre-SoftBank bid. SoftBank paid $4B = ~10x fee revenue.

## Why multiples vary

**Higher multiples (15-20x) for:**
- Diversified strategies (PE, credit, real estate, infrastructure)
- Permanent capital (insurance float, BDCs, evergreen funds)
- High carried interest realization
- Strong fundraising track record
- Growing FEEUM

**Lower multiples (8-12x) for:**
- Single strategy (digital infra only, real estate only)
- Traditional fund structures (10-year funds, fundraising cycles)
- Stock price overhang (legacy issues, conglomerate discount)
- Smaller scale, less balance sheet firepower

---

## GP economics breakdown

Asset managers earn money three ways:

### 1. Management fees (~1-1.5% of FEEUM)
- Recurring, predictable, high margin
- Paid regardless of performance
- The "base" of the business

### 2. Carried interest (~20% of profits above hurdle)
- Lumpy, depends on exits and realizations
- Can be massive in good years, zero in bad
- Why PE firms push for permanent capital (smooths carry)

### 3. Balance sheet income
- Returns on GP co-investments
- Insurance spread income ([[Apollo]]/[[Athene]] model)
- Increasingly important differentiator

## Fee-related earnings (FRE)

Wall Street values alt managers on **FRE** — the recurring fee income stripped of volatile performance fees.

| Component | Included in FRE? |
|-----------|------------------|
| Management fees | Yes |
| Transaction fees | Yes |
| Monitoring fees | Yes |
| Carried interest | **No** |
| Performance fees | **No** |
| Realized gains | **No** |

**FRE multiple** = most comparable valuation metric across firms.

## The DigitalBridge case study

Why did [[SoftBank]] pay only $4B for $108B AUM?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $108B (LP money) |
| FEEUM | $40.7B |
| Implied fee revenue | ~$400M/year |
| Deal price | $4B |
| **Multiple** | **~10x fee revenue** |

10x is fair for:
- Single-strategy manager (digital infra only)
- Broken stock price (Colony Capital legacy)
- No insurance/permanent capital engine
- Smaller than BX/KKR/APO

The 65% premium to pre-leak price shows how undervalued the stock was, not how rich the deal was.

## Traditional vs alternative manager valuation

| Type | Typical multiple | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Traditional AM** (mutual funds) | 1-3% of AUM | Commoditized, fee compression, passive threat |
| **Alternative AM** (PE/credit/infra) | 8-15% of AUM | Higher fees, stickier capital, less competition |
| **Insurance-integrated AM** | 15-20% of AUM | Permanent capital, spread income, compounding |

[[Apollo]]'s merger with [[Athene]] and [[KKR]]'s acquisition of [[Global Atlantic]] represent the frontier — combining asset management fees with insurance spread income.

---

## Why this matters for investors

1. **Don't confuse AUM with value** — a $500B AUM manager isn't worth $500B
2. **Fee revenue is the anchor** — 10-20x FRE is the range
3. **Permanent capital commands premium** — insurance-integrated models trade higher
4. **Single-strategy discount** — pure-play managers trade cheaper than diversified
5. **Stock price matters** — broken stocks (DBRG) get takeout bids at "low" AUM multiples that are actually fair FRE multiples
