# Distressed Debt Exchange

**Swap old bonds for new terms** — a restructuring technique where a company exchanges existing debt for new securities with different terms (lower principal, extended maturity, different priority). The goal: avoid bankruptcy while reducing debt burden.

## How it works

```
Company in distress
    ↓
Offers exchange: "Give us your old bonds, get new bonds"
    ↓
New bonds have: lower face value, or longer maturity, or lower priority
    ↓
If enough holders participate → company survives (for now)
    ↓
If not enough participate → bankruptcy likely
```

**The trade-off:** Creditors accept a haircut now to avoid potentially worse recovery in bankruptcy.

## Typical exchange terms

| What creditors give up | What creditors get |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Full face value | Reduced principal (e.g., 70 cents on dollar) |
| Near-term maturity | Extended maturity |
| Senior position | May be pushed to 2O/3O |
| Covenants | Relaxed restrictions |

**Sweeteners to incentivize participation:**
- Cash payment for early tenders
- Better position in [[Payment waterfall]]
- Consent fees
- Equity warrants

## Case study: Saks Global (August 2025)

[[Saks Global]] executed a textbook distressed exchange:

### Before exchange
| Instrument | Amount | Terms |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 11% Senior Secured Notes | $2.2B | Due 2029 |

### The offer
- Swap old notes for mix of SPV Notes (1O), Second Out (2O), Third Out (3O)
- New money ($300M) got senior SPV position
- Early tenders got better allocation

### After exchange
| Instrument | Amount | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|
| SPV Notes (SGUS) | $762M | First Out |
| 2O Notes | $1.4B | Second Out |
| 3O Notes | $441M | Third Out |
| Old Notes (holdouts) | $51M | Junior to all |

**Participation:** 98% of bondholders exchanged.

### Outcome
The exchange bought 5 months — not enough. [[Saks bankruptcy]] filed January 2026. Holdouts who refused the exchange were wiped out, but so were most who participated (2O/3O trading at pennies).

## Why companies do exchanges

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Avoid bankruptcy** | Preserve operations, brand, relationships |
| **Reduce debt** | Lower principal = lower interest burden |
| **Extend runway** | Push maturities out |
| **Maintain control** | Management stays (unlike Chapter 11) |

---

## Why creditors participate

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| **Avoid worse outcome** | Bankruptcy recovery often lower |
| **Get priority** | Early tenders get 1O/2O position |
| **Consent fees** | Cash for participating |
| **Coercive structure** | Holdouts get crammed down |

---

## The holdout problem

**Coercion mechanics:** Exchanges are structured to punish non-participants:

| If you participate | If you hold out |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Get new notes with better priority | Stuck with old notes |
| Part of steering committee | No seat at table |
| May get fees | Get nothing |
| Old notes stripped of covenants | Covenant-lite paper |

**Exit consents:** Participating holders vote to strip covenants from old bonds, making holdout position worse.

## When exchanges fail

| Failure mode | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Not enough participation** | Can't reach threshold (usually 90%+) |
| **Buys time, not survival** | Saks — 5 months then bankruptcy anyway |
| **New money insufficient** | Cash burn exceeds financing raised |
| **Business continues to decline** | Restructuring doesn't fix operations |

**Saks lesson:** 98% participation, $600M raised, still failed. The operating business was broken — financial engineering couldn't fix it.

## Investment implications

**For distressed debt investors:**
- Exchange offers = opportunity to improve position
- Early participation often rewarded
- But: exchange success ≠ company survival (Saks)

**For equity:**
- Exchanges dilute equity implicitly
- Often precursor to bankruptcy
- Management doing exchange = distress signal

**Warning signs a company may offer exchange:**
- Bonds trading at significant discount
- Near-term maturities with no refinancing path
- Covenant issues
- Cash flow insufficient for interest
