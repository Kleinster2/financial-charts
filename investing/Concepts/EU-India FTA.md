## Why it matters

## Professional mobility — India's big win

**Context:** US tightening H-1B under [[Trump II]]. EU just opened major alternative pathway for Indian talent.

### Categories covered

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intra-Corporate Transferees (ICT)** | Employees moving within multinationals (e.g., [[TCS]] manager → EU office) |
| **Business Visitors** | Short-term travel for meetings, negotiations |
| **Contractual Service Suppliers (CSS)** | Indian firms sending workers to fulfill EU contracts |
| **Independent Professionals (IP)** | Freelancers/consultants serving EU clients |

**Family rights:** Dependents of ICTs get entry + work rights across EU.

### Sector access

| Type | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| **CSS (contract workers)** | 37 sub-sectors |
| **Independent Professionals** | 17 sub-sectors |
| **Key sectors** | IT, R&D, professional services, education, higher ed |
| **Traditional medicine** | Ayurveda/yoga practitioners can work under "home title" |

### What changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Each EU country had different rules | Harmonized framework across 27 Schengen nations |
| No guaranteed access | Assured regime for temporary entry |
| Social security fragmented | Framework for SSA with all EU states within 5 years |
| Qualification recognition ad hoc | Skills Dialogue launching 2026 |

### Infrastructure

**European Legal Gateway Office** — New one-stop hub in [[India]] to facilitate worker movement to EU. Starts with ICT sector.

| Erasmus+ / Erasmus Mundus | Student exchange access |

### The trade-off

India traded services market access for labor mobility — essentially exporting workers instead of importing capital. This is the **opposite** of what US trade deals typically demand.

India wins: assured pathway for IT workers, students, professionals to EU

## Ratification path

Unlike [[CETA]] (mixed agreement requiring national parliaments), EU hopes for faster ratification:

| Body | Role |
|------|------|
| European Council | Must approve |
| European Parliament | Must ratify |
| Member states | TBD (mixed vs EU-only) |

If treated as EU-only competence (like [[EU-Japan EPA]]), could implement in months. If mixed agreement, could take years.

## What accelerated the deal

|--------|--------|
| [[Trump II]] tariffs | Both sides facing US pressure |
| Ukraine war | EU diversifying from Russia, China |
| China competition | India alternative for manufacturing |
