**Rare earth elements** — 17 metallic elements critical for magnets, electronics, and defense. China controls 60% mining, 90% processing. Individual elements have vastly different strategic importance.

---

## The critical distinction: Light vs Heavy

| Category | Examples | Abundance | China control | Strategic risk |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Light (LREE)** | Nd, Pr, La, Ce | Common | ~60% | Moderate |
| **Heavy (HREE)** | Dy, Tb, Eu, Y | Scarce | ~99% | Severe |

**Key insight**: Heavy rare earths are the real chokepoint. Light REEs have alternative sources (Australia, US). Heavy REEs are almost exclusively Chinese.

## Individual element profiles

### Neodymium (Nd) — The magnet metal

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Strongest permanent magnets (NdFeB) |
| Applications | EVs, wind turbines, speakers, defense |
| Per EV | 0.5-1.2 kg of NdFeB magnets |
| Price | ~$100/kg oxide |
| China control | ~90% processing |

**Why it matters**: Every EV motor, every wind turbine, every precision-guided munition needs neodymium magnets.

---

### [[Dysprosium]] (Dy) — The heat stabilizer

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Prevents magnet demagnetization at high temps |
| Applications | EV traction motors (150-180°C), wind turbines, nuclear control rods, defense |
| Per EV | 20-60 grams |
| Price | $300-400/kg oxide |
| China control | ~99% processing |
| **Myanmar mining** | **~50% of global** |
| China exports | **>50% to Japan**, ~10% Korea, **0.1% to US** |

**Name origin:** Greek for "hard to obtain."

**Why it matters**: Without dysprosium, NdFeB magnets lose 50% strength at 150°C. With 6% Dy, only 15% loss. Essential for EV motors.

**The bottleneck**: Most constrained REE. Almost no non-China production. 2025 controls specifically targeted Dy. **Myanmar supplies ~50% of global Dy mining** — but all goes to China for processing. [[Lynas]] Malaysia expansion for Dy/Tb expected June 2025. See [[Dysprosium]] for full analysis.

### [[Terbium]] (Tb) — The dual-role element

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Phosphors (green) AND magnet additive |
| Applications | LED displays, smartphones, EV magnets, aircraft, submarines, missiles |
| Price | $450-600/kg oxide |
| China control | ~99% processing |
| **Myanmar mining** | **~50% of global** |
| China exports | **85% to Japan**, ~5% to US |

**DoD assessment:** "One of the hardest elements to source" — makes up less than 1% of REE content in most deposits.

**Why it matters**: Only REE with critical roles in both magnets (Dy substitute) and phosphors (green). 20x demand growth projected by 2040. **Myanmar supplies ~50% of global Tb mining** — but all goes to China. See [[Terbium]] for full analysis.

### Praseodymium (Pr) — The neodymium companion

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Combined with Nd as "NdPr" |
| Applications | Magnets, aircraft alloys |
| China control | ~90% processing |

**Why it matters**: Often processed together with neodymium. NdPr pricing is a key market benchmark.

**2024 refined NdPr production:**

| Producer | Output |
|----------|--------|
| China | **58,300 tons** |
| US (MP Materials) | 1,130 tons |

US produces **<2%** of China's NdPr output. Not targeted in April 2025 controls — too disruptive to global supply.

---

### Samarium (Sm) — The defense magnet

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Samarium-cobalt magnets (SmCo) |
| Applications | Defense, aerospace, turbines, cars, optical lasers, nuclear reactors |
| China control | ~97% |
| US status | **SmCo alloys on critical stockpiling list** |

**Why it matters**: SmCo magnets work at higher temps than NdFeB without dysprosium. Used in military applications where reliability is critical. Formerly common in headphones.

---

### [[Europium]] (Eu) — The red phosphor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Red phosphor in displays |
| Applications | Displays, night vision, quantum dots |
| China control | ~95% |

See [[Europium]] for full analysis including quantum computing potential.

---

### Yttrium (Y) — The ceramics element

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Ceramics, phosphors, alloys, medical |
| Applications | Jet engines, LEDs, superconductors, liver cancer treatment, dental/medical lasers |
| China control | ~90% |
| US imports | **93% from China** (2020-2023) |
| US production | Mountain Pass mines Y but exports for processing |

---

### Gadolinium (Gd) — The medical imaging element

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | MRI contrast dye, alloys, nuclear |
| Applications | Medical imaging (MRI scans), magnets, electronic components, data storage, nuclear reactor cores |
| China control | ~98% |

**Why it matters**: Gadolinium-based contrast agents enable MRI visibility of organs. Also enhances alloy resistance to high temps and oxidation.

---

### Lutetium (Lu) — The catalyst element

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Chemical catalyst in oil refining |
| Applications | Oil refineries (hydrocarbon cracking) |
| China control | ~96% |
| US imports | **Nearly 100% from China** |

**Distinctive property**: Hard and dense — unlike most rare earths which are soft.

---

### Scandium (Sc) — The aerospace alloy

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Lightweight high-strength alloys |
| Applications | Fighter planes, baseball bats, bicycle frames, oil refining tracers, pipe leak detection |
| China control | ~80% |
| Other producers | India ~10%, Russia ~10% |
| US production | **None in 50+ years** |
| US imports | 14% of China's Sc+Y exports |

**Name origin**: Scandinavia (first discovered there).

**Sourcing**: Extracted from mine tailings or as uranium mining by-product.

**EU status**: No current production, but project commissioning 2026.

## 2025 export controls by element

China's April 2025 controls targeted specific REEs:

| Wave | Elements | Strategic focus |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **April 2025** | Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Lu, Sc, Y | Heavy REEs, magnet metals |
| **October 2025** | Ho, Er, Tm, Eu, Yb | Additional heavy REEs |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for full timeline.

## Supply chain by element

| Element | Mining | Processing | Magnets |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| Nd | China 60%, Australia, Myanmar | China 90% | China 90% |
| Dy | China 90%+, Myanmar | China 99% | China 99% |
| Tb | China 90%+ | China 99% | China 99% |
| Pr | China 60%, Australia | China 90% | China 90% |

**The processing bottleneck**: Even ore mined in Australia goes to China for separation and processing.

---

## Substitution possibilities

| Element | Substitute | Trade-off |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Dy | Tb | More expensive, also China-controlled |
| Dy | None | Accept lower operating temps |
| Nd | Ferrite | 90% weaker magnets |
| Nd | SmCo | 2x cost, still needs China supply |

**Reality**: No near-term substitutes for high-performance applications.

---

## Investment implications

**Most critical elements** (highest supply risk):
1. Dysprosium — EV motors, defense
2. Terbium — Phosphors, magnet additive
3. Europium — Displays

**Most volume** (largest markets):
1. Neodymium — Magnets
2. Praseodymium — Magnets
3. Cerium — Catalysts

**Beneficiaries of diversification**:
- Non-China HREE miners (rare)
- Magnet recycling technology
- Alternative motor designs (reduced REE content)
