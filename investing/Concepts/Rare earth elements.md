**Rare earth elements** — 17 metallic elements critical for magnets, electronics, and defense. China controls 60% mining, 90% processing. Individual elements have vastly different strategic importance.

## The critical distinction: Light vs Heavy

| Category | Examples | Abundance | China control | Strategic risk |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Light (LREE)** | Nd, Pr, La, Ce | Common | ~60% | Moderate |
| **Heavy (HREE)** | Dy, Tb, Eu, Y | Scarce | ~99% | Severe |

**Key insight**: Heavy rare earths are the real chokepoint. Light REEs have alternative sources (Australia, US). Heavy REEs are almost exclusively Chinese.

## Individual element profiles

### Neodymium (Nd) — The magnet metal

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Strongest permanent magnets (NdFeB) |
| Applications | EVs, wind turbines, speakers, defense |
| Per EV | 0.5-1.2 kg of NdFeB magnets |
| Price | ~$100/kg oxide |
| China control | ~90% processing |

**Why it matters**: Every EV motor, every wind turbine, every precision-guided munition needs neodymium magnets.

---

### Dysprosium (Dy) — The heat stabilizer

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Prevents magnet demagnetization at high temps |
| Applications | EV traction motors (150-180°C), defense |
| Per EV | 20-60 grams |
| Price | $300-400/kg oxide |
| China control | ~99% |

**Why it matters**: Without dysprosium, NdFeB magnets lose 50% strength at 150°C. With 6% Dy, only 15% loss. Essential for EV motors.

**The bottleneck**: Most constrained REE. Almost no non-China production. 2025 controls specifically targeted Dy.

---

### Terbium (Tb) — The green phosphor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Phosphors (green), magnet additive |
| Applications | LED displays, fuel cells, magnets |
| Price | $450-600/kg oxide |
| China control | ~99% |

**Why it matters**: Just 0.5g produces the green phosphor for a standard LED display. Also substitutes for dysprosium in magnets.

---

### Praseodymium (Pr) — The neodymium companion

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Combined with Nd as "NdPr" |
| Applications | Magnets, aircraft alloys |
| China control | ~90% processing |

**Why it matters**: Often processed together with neodymium. NdPr pricing is a key market benchmark.

---

### Samarium (Sm) — The defense magnet

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Samarium-cobalt magnets (SmCo) |
| Applications | Defense, aerospace, high-temp |
| China control | ~90% |

**Why it matters**: SmCo magnets work at higher temps than NdFeB without dysprosium. Used in military applications where reliability is critical.

---

### Europium (Eu) — The red phosphor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Red phosphor in displays |
| Applications | Displays, nuclear control rods |
| China control | ~95% |

---

### Yttrium (Y) — The ceramics element

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Use | Ceramics, phosphors, alloys |
| Applications | Jet engines, LEDs, superconductors |
| China control | ~90% |

## 2025 export controls by element

China's April 2025 controls targeted specific REEs:

| Wave | Elements | Strategic focus |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **April 2025** | Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Lu, Sc, Y | Heavy REEs, magnet metals |
| **October 2025** | Ho, Er, Tm, Eu, Yb | Additional heavy REEs |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for full timeline.

## Supply chain by element

| Element | Mining | Processing | Magnets |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| Nd | China 60%, Australia, Myanmar | China 90% | China 90% |
| Dy | China 90%+, Myanmar | China 99% | China 99% |
| Tb | China 90%+ | China 99% | China 99% |
| Pr | China 60%, Australia | China 90% | China 90% |

**The processing bottleneck**: Even ore mined in Australia goes to China for separation and processing.

---

## Substitution possibilities

| Element | Substitute | Trade-off |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Dy | Tb | More expensive, also China-controlled |
| Dy | None | Accept lower operating temps |
| Nd | Ferrite | 90% weaker magnets |
| Nd | SmCo | 2x cost, still needs China supply |

**Reality**: No near-term substitutes for high-performance applications.

## Investment implications

**Most critical elements** (highest supply risk):
1. Dysprosium — EV motors, defense
2. Terbium — Phosphors, magnet additive
3. Europium — Displays

**Most volume** (largest markets):
1. Neodymium — Magnets
2. Praseodymium — Magnets
3. Cerium — Catalysts

**Beneficiaries of diversification**:
- Non-China HREE miners (rare)
- Magnet recycling technology
- Alternative motor designs (reduced REE content)
