# Single stock dispersion

#concept #markets #volatility

**Single stock dispersion** — the magnitude of individual stock price moves relative to the overall index. High dispersion means stocks are making large moves in different directions while the index stays flat. Distinct from [[Breadth divergence]], which measures how many stocks move up vs down; dispersion measures how far they move.

---

## The concept

Dispersion = the spread of individual stock returns around the index return.

When dispersion is high but index volatility is low, it signals that large moves are happening beneath the surface but **cancelling each other out** at the index level. Winners and losers are both making extreme moves, but netting to flat.

| Regime | Index vol | Stock vol | What it means |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **High dispersion, low index vol** | Low | High | Micro narratives dominate; stockpicker's market |
| **Low dispersion, low index vol** | Low | Low | Everything correlated and calm |
| **High dispersion, high index vol** | High | Very high | Crisis with differentiation (2008-09) |
| **Low dispersion, high index vol** | High | High | Macro-driven selloff, everything moves together |

## Feb 2026: Extreme dispersion

The gap between single-stock moves and subdued index performance reached its **highest level since 2009**, per [[Citadel Securities]].

### Key data points

| Metric | Reading | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| S&P 500 YTD | Roughly flat | — |
| Stocks ±20% YTD | >20% of S&P 500 | FT/Citadel Securities |
| Risers vs fallers (among ±20%) | ~2:1 ratio | FT |
| [[Mega-cap tech acronyms\|Mag 7]] YTD | −5.6% | FT |
| Sectors rising | 7 of 11 | FT |
| S&P earnings growth Q4 2025 | +12% YoY (4th consecutive double-digit quarter) | Bloomberg |
| Revenue growth | +9% YoY | [[Société Générale]] |
| Sectors with margin expansion | 7 of 11 | Société Générale |
| Stocks outperforming index | >60% of S&P 500 (broadest in decades) | — |
| Active large-cap funds beating benchmark | >50% (highest in ~20 years) | [[Goldman Sachs]] |

### What's driving it

**AI repricing.** "The threat posed by AI has accelerated repricing across vulnerable business models, intensifying rotation even as headline performance remains contained" — Scott Rubner, [[Citadel Securities]].

Three forces creating extreme individual moves:

1. **Strong earnings broadly** — 12% YoY growth, 9% revenue growth, 7/11 sectors expanding margins. Individual names getting rewarded or punished based on results ([[Deere]] +10% on earnings beat, [[Spotify]] +15% then −8% in days)
2. **Mag 7 drag** — [[Amazon]], [[Microsoft]], [[Alphabet]] sold off on $660bn combined AI capex plans (+60% YoY). Tech giants' spending is both an existential bet and a weight on returns
3. **AI disruption repricing** — software and logistics stocks hit on fear that AI threatens their business models, creating sharp losers alongside sharp winners in other sectors

### The active management revival

This is the best environment for stockpickers in almost two decades:

- **>50% of active large-cap funds outperforming** — highest hit rate since ~2007
- Active underperformed for years because [[Mega-cap tech acronyms|mega-cap tech]] concentration meant passive automatically held the biggest winners
- With Mag 7 lagging and breadth at multi-decade highs, concentration is now a *headwind* for passive
- "Violent rotations" from tech to consumer durables and other sectors ([[Barclays]], Venu Krishna)

### The index paradox

Manish Kabra ([[Société Générale]]): "The macro message underlying the index is actually boom. Revenue is growing at 9 per cent. Seven out of 11 sectors have seen profit margin expansion." The lack of excitement in tech is **masking** broad-based strength.

The implication: in an earnings-driven market (vs multiple-expansion), index returns stay muted but **internal returns can be phenomenal**. This is structurally different from the 2020-24 regime where you just needed to own mega-cap tech.

---

## Implications

**For index investors:** Flat index ≠ flat market. The average stock is doing well; the index is misleading because of cap-weighting and Mag 7 drag.

**For active managers:** Best environment in years. Fundamental research is being rewarded. Dispersion creates both winners and losers — you just need to be on the right side.

**For the AI trade:** The market is simultaneously pricing in AI's enormous infrastructure cost (punishing the spenders) and its disruptive potential (punishing the disrupted). The beneficiaries — picks-and-shovels names, infrastructure software, sectors gaining from rotation — are where the 20%+ moves are happening.

**For [[Separately Managed Accounts|SMAs]]:** This is the pitch. When dispersion is extreme, concentrated active management with real research can meaningfully differentiate from passive. The 2009 comparison is apt — post-GFC was also a great vintage for active.

## Historical context

| Period | Dispersion level | Context |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **2009** | Last comparable extreme | Post-GFC recovery; massive differentiation between survivors and casualties |
| **2020** | Elevated | COVID winners vs losers |
| **2016-2019** | Low | Low-vol, momentum-driven market |
| **Feb 2026** | Highest since 2009 | AI repricing + earnings-driven rotation |

### Sister concepts
- [[Market internals framework]] — positions dispersion as one of four orthogonal dimensions (with breadth, correlation, volatility) for reading market structure
- [[Breadth divergence]] — measures direction count vs dispersion's magnitude; both elevated now, signaling healthy rotation not a narrow top
- [[Sector rotation]] — the mechanism through which dispersion manifests (money leaving tech, entering other sectors)

### Market structure
- [[Mega-cap tech acronyms]] — Mag 7's −5.6% drag is the primary reason index is flat despite broad strength
- [[February 2026 AI Disruption Cascade]] — AI repricing is a key driver of current dispersion
