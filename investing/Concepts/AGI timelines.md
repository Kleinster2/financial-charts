Debate over when AI reaches human-level or superhuman capability.

## Definitions (contested)

**AGI:** AI that can do most economically valuable digital work. The "remote worker replacement" — takes in information, solves digital tasks, learns from feedback.

**ASI:** Artificial superintelligence. Finding unexpected scientific discoveries, seeing patterns across all medical records humans couldn't spot.

## Situational Awareness report

Leopold Aschenbrenner's influential report predicted:
- Superhuman coder → superhuman AI researcher → ASI
- Originally: 2027-28
- Updated: pushed back to **2031** mean prediction

Core thesis: once you have superhuman coder, everything else follows quickly because AI can accelerate its own research.

## Skeptical view

Models are "jagged" — excellent at some things, bad at others. Superhuman at website code, bad at distributed ML training (little training data). This jaggedness persists.

Research is "messy, social, and largely in the data in ways AI models can't process."

## Current gaps

**Continual learning:** Employees learn from feedback. LLMs don't update themselves quickly. Key gap for "remote worker replacement."

**Tool use / computer use:** Demos of Claude/ChatGPT using computers all "suck." Lots of investment, little progress.

## What's actually happening

Big Tech spending billions regardless of AGI timeline. Better ChatGPT, better Cursor coming — useful even if not AGI.

"Automated software engineer" closer than "automated AI researcher." Software development becoming more design/outcomes-oriented, less code-focused.

## The productive framing

Instead of AGI timeline debates:
- When does AI have obvious economic impact?
- GDP jump question more concrete than "AGI"
- Software value changes when you don't look at code anymore
