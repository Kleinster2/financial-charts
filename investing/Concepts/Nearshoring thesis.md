## The thesis

Mexico is the biggest beneficiary of US-China tensions:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DC investment | $9.2B (4 years) |
| Chip imports | $23.5B (2024) |
| AWS investment | $5B |
| CloudHQ | $4.8B |

## Why Mexico?

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| USMCA | Tariff-free US access |
| Proximity | Same time zones |
| Labor | Lower cost than US |
| Land | Available, cheap |
| Energy | Growing capacity |
