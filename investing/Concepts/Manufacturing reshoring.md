## Legislative drivers

| Act | Focus | Investment catalyzed |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| CHIPS and Science Act (2022) | Semiconductors | $449B private |
| Inflation Reduction Act (2022) | Clean energy, EVs | $215B clean power, $184B EVs |
| IIJA (2021) | Infrastructure | Enabling |
| **Total** | | ~$1T private investment |

## Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Reshored jobs (2023) | 287,000 (record) |
| Semiconductor FDI (2024-25) | $102.6B (⅔ of all foreign capital) |
| Semiconductor share of reshoring | 35% of all announced jobs |

---

## Key sectors

| Sector | Driver | Major projects |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Semiconductors | CHIPS Act | [[Intel]] (Ohio, Arizona), [[TSMC]] (Arizona), [[Samsung]] (Texas) |
| EVs & batteries | IRA | [[Ford]], [[GM]], [[Tesla]] + battery JVs |
| Clean energy | IRA | Solar, wind manufacturing |
| Defense | Buy American | Domestic sourcing mandates |

## CHIPS Act status

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Funding announced | Complete |
| Production ramp | 2025-2027 |
| Full capacity | 2032 (3x US capacity) |

Intel, TSMC, Samsung, Micron all building US fabs.

## 2026 outlook (Deloitte)

| Metric | Projection |
|--------|------------|
| Revenue growth | +4.4% |
| Capex growth | +3% |
| Employment growth | +0.4% (skilled roles) |

Modest recovery after challenging 2025 (ISM PMI at 47.9).

## Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Labor shortage | Skilled manufacturing workers scarce |
| Infrastructure | Grid, logistics bottlenecks |
| Cost | US labor 3-5x Asia |
| Policy uncertainty | Trump II administration shifts |
| Timeline | Many announcements delayed or cancelled |

---

## Nearshoring alternative

| Destination | Advantage | Constraint |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| [[Mexico]] | USMCA, proximity, lower cost | Tariff uncertainty |
| [[Canada]] | USMCA, skilled labor | Small market |

USMCA makes Mexico natural nearshoring beneficiary, but "America First" policy creates uncertainty.

## Investment implications

| Expression | Vehicles | Risk |
|------------|----------|------|
| Construction | Equipment, materials | Cyclical |
| Semiconductors | [[Intel]], equipment makers | Execution |
| Industrial automation | Robots, controls | Adoption curve |
| Real estate | Industrial REITs | Oversupply |
