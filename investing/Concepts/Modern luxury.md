# Modern luxury

A generational shift in luxury consumption — away from logos and heritage toward quality, craft, and understated design. Often called "quiet luxury" (peaked 2023) but the underlying trend is structural, not cyclical.

## The Row as archetype

[[The Row]] (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, founded 2006) exemplifies modern luxury:
- Ultra-minimal aesthetic, no visible branding
- $2K-$10K price points
- Cult following, waitlists
- Limited retail (own stores, Bergdorf)
- Celebrity-founded but anti-celebrity marketing
- Acquired by [[Chanel]] for minority stake (2024)

## Conglomerate response

Traditional luxury houses are adapting:

| House | Response |
|-------|----------|
| [[LVMH]] | Acquired Aesop (2023, $2.5B), Le Labo already in portfolio |
| [[Kering]] | Quiet luxury pivot at Bottega Veneta under Matthieu Blazy |
| [[Chanel]] | Minority stake in The Row (2024) |
| [[Hermès]] | Already positioned as quiet luxury; benefiting from trend |

## Investment implications

**Winners:**
- Hermès — already quiet luxury, pricing power intact
- Founder-led brands with DTC control
- Aesop, Le Labo (inside LVMH)
- Quality-focused manufacturers

**Losers:**
- Logo-heavy brands (Gucci's struggle)
- Aspirational luxury dependent on status signaling
- Wholesale-dependent brands

**M&A targets:** Independent modern luxury brands with strong DTC and cult following (The Row model).
