**AI in banking** — Financial services AI adoption. Singapore leading with government-coordinated retraining; US/[[Europe]] seeing job cuts.

---

## Singapore model (Jan 2026)

**Government-led retraining:** 35,000 bankers across DBS, OCBC, UOB retrained over 1-2 years. No mass layoffs — attrition + reskilling.

**Key players:**
- MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) — reviews AI safeguards before deployment
- Institute of Banking and Finance — up to 90% salary support for reskilling
- National Jobs Council — coordinates with banks

### Bank efficiency (Cost/Income Ratio 2024)

| Bank | Ratio | Region |
|------|-------|--------|
| **DBS** | **38.5%** | Singapore |
| **OCBC** | **38.9%** | Singapore |
| **UOB** | **43.5%** | Singapore |
| CBA | 45.2% | [[Australia]] |
| JPMorgan | 51.5% | US |
| [[Capital One]] | 55.1% | US |
| RBC | 55.0% | [[Canada]] |
| [[Morgan Stanley]] | 70.0% | US |

Singapore banks most efficient globally.

### AI productivity gains

| Bank | Use case | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| OCBC | Document drafting (agentic AI) | 1 day → 10 min |
| OCBC | AI models deployed | 400 models, 6M decisions/day |
| DBS | Internal AI assistant | 1M+ prompts/month |
| DBS | Call handling time | -20% |
| DBS | Expected profit boost | S$1.6B (~17%) |
| UOB | AI use cases deployed | 300+ |
| UOB | Copilot access | All employees |

### Job impact (Singapore)

| Bank | Approach |
|------|----------|
| DBS | -4,000 temp/contract over 3 years (not permanent) |
| OCBC | No AI-related cuts |
| UOB | No AI-related cuts |

**RM productivity:** Client coverage expected to increase from 50 to 60-70 per relationship manager.

**Attrition strategy:** Not filling roles when staff leave rather than layoffs.

## US big banks (2025-2026)

**2025 = implementation year, 2026 = inflection point for profitability and [[agentic AI]].**

### [[Wells Fargo]] — Playing catch-up, not leading

Most aggressive headcount cuts among big 4 US banks — but that's because they're *behind* on productivity, not ahead.

**Profitability per employee (2024):**

| Bank | Employees | Net Income | NI/Employee |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| JPMorgan | 317k | ~$60B | **$189k** |
| Bank of America | 213k | ~$27B | $127k |
| Wells Fargo | 210k | ~$20B | $95k |
| Citigroup | 229k | ~$13B | $57k |

JPM generates **2x more profit per employee** than WFC. The aggressive AI-for-cost-cutting is about catching up to peers, not extending a lead. Compare to Singapore banks at 38-43% efficiency ratios — that's the real benchmark.

| Metric | 2019 | Sept 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| Headcount | 275,000 | 210,000 | **-65,000 (-24%)** |

**Jan 2026:** Hired **Faraz Shafiq** (ex-[[Amazon Web Services|AWS]]) as head of AI products. Reports to [[Saul Van Beurden]] (head of AI + consumer). Focus: companywide AI needs, agentic AI, avoiding "sprawl" of redundant solutions.

**CEO [[Charlie Scharf]] (Dec 2025):**
- "Even pre-AI, we expect to have less people next year"
- "Gen AI tools within our engineering workforce were 30% to 35% more efficient in writing code today"
- "We've not reduced coders, but getting a lot more done — that's real efficiency"
- AI described as "positive reality" for the bank

**Approach:** Gradual rollout through 2026+. If jobs "completely go away through AI," goal is workforce trained with AI skills for redeployment.

**Q4 2025:** $612M severance charges — efficiency push continuing even post-asset-cap removal.

### [[JPMorgan Chase]] — "AI Arms Race" leader

Largest tech budget among banks. Jamie Dimon: AI could be as transformational as the internet.

### [[Citigroup]] — Restructuring + AI

Jane Fraser's simplification plan includes AI for back-office efficiency.

### [[Bank of America]] — Customer-facing AI

Erica virtual assistant: 2B+ interactions. Focus on client service AI.

### Contrast with Singapore

| Approach | US Big Banks | Singapore |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Job cuts** | Yes (WFC -65k, more coming) | Attrition only |
| **Retraining** | Stated goal | Government-funded (90% salary support) |
| **Regulatory review** | Ad hoc | MAS reviews before deployment |
| **Coordination** | Each bank alone | Industry-wide via MAS |

---

## Use cases

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Document drafting** | Client reports, order forms, compliance docs |
| **Risk scoring** | Credit risk, AML false positive filtering |
| **Customer service** | Chatbots, call handling |
| **Fraud detection** | Transaction monitoring |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory reporting, suspicious activity |

## Investment implications

**Singapore banks:**
- DBS (DBSDF) — largest, most AI-advanced
- OCBC (OVCHY) — strong AI lab
- UOB (UOVEY) — broad deployment

**Watch for:**
- Cost/income ratio improvements
- Headcount trends (attrition vs hiring)
- AI-driven revenue per employee gains
- Regulatory frameworks spreading
