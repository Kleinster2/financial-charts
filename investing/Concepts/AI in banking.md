**AI in banking** — Financial services AI adoption. Singapore leading with government-coordinated retraining; US/Europe seeing job cuts.

---

## Singapore model (Jan 2026)

**Government-led retraining:** 35,000 bankers across DBS, OCBC, UOB retrained over 1-2 years. No mass layoffs — attrition + reskilling.

**Key players:**
- MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) — reviews AI safeguards before deployment
- Institute of Banking and Finance — up to 90% salary support for reskilling
- National Jobs Council — coordinates with banks

### Bank efficiency (Cost/Income Ratio 2024)

| Bank | Ratio | Region |
|------|-------|--------|
| **DBS** | **38.5%** | Singapore |
| **OCBC** | **38.9%** | Singapore |
| **UOB** | **43.5%** | Singapore |
| CBA | 45.2% | Australia |
| JPMorgan | 51.5% | US |
| Capital One | 55.1% | US |
| RBC | 55.0% | Canada |
| Morgan Stanley | 70.0% | US |

Singapore banks most efficient globally.

### AI productivity gains

| Bank | Use case | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| OCBC | Document drafting (agentic AI) | 1 day → 10 min |
| OCBC | AI models deployed | 400 models, 6M decisions/day |
| DBS | Internal AI assistant | 1M+ prompts/month |
| DBS | Call handling time | -20% |
| DBS | Expected profit boost | S$1.6B (~17%) |
| UOB | AI use cases deployed | 300+ |
| UOB | Copilot access | All employees |

### Job impact (Singapore)

| Bank | Approach |
|------|----------|
| DBS | -4,000 temp/contract over 3 years (not permanent) |
| OCBC | No AI-related cuts |
| UOB | No AI-related cuts |

**RM productivity:** Client coverage expected to increase from 50 to 60-70 per relationship manager.

**Attrition strategy:** Not filling roles when staff leave rather than layoffs.

## US/Europe approach

**More aggressive cuts:**

| Bank | Action |
|------|--------|
| Goldman Sachs | Told staff to expect more cuts as AI saves costs |
| Others | Various reductions |

Contrast with Singapore's retraining focus.

## Use cases

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Document drafting** | Client reports, order forms, compliance docs |
| **Risk scoring** | Credit risk, AML false positive filtering |
| **Customer service** | Chatbots, call handling |
| **Fraud detection** | Transaction monitoring |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory reporting, suspicious activity |

## Investment implications

**Singapore banks:**
- DBS (DBSDF) — largest, most AI-advanced
- OCBC (OVCHY) — strong AI lab
- UOB (UOVEY) — broad deployment

**Watch for:**
- Cost/income ratio improvements
- Headcount trends (attrition vs hiring)
- AI-driven revenue per employee gains
- Regulatory frameworks spreading
