The **CHIPS and Science Act** (2022) provides ~$52.7B to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.

## Key provisions

- $39B direct manufacturing incentives
- $13.2B R&D and workforce development
- 25% investment tax credit
- Restrictions on recipients expanding in China

## Major recipients

| Company | Direct subsidies | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | $8.5B + $11B loans | Largest recipient |
| [[TSMC]] | $6.6B | Arizona fabs |
| [[Samsung]] | $6.4B | Taylor, Texas |

## Strategic intent

- Reduce dependence on [[Taiwan concentration risk|Taiwan-concentrated production]]
- Respond to China competition
- Rebuild domestic manufacturing capability

## Limitations

- Subsidies improve project IRRs but don't eliminate [[Execution risk in foundries]]
- Cost gap with Asia not fully closed
- Compliance requirements constrain strategic flexibility
- Geographic diversification benefits customers more than fabs
