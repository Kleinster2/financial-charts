The **CHIPS and Science Act** (2022) provides ~$52.7B to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Largest industrial policy since WWII.

> **Key insight:** CHIPS Act improves project IRRs but doesn't eliminate execution risk or close the cost gap with [[Asia]]. It's necessary but not sufficient.

## Key provisions

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Manufacturing incentives | $39B | Direct subsidies for fab construction |
| R&D and workforce | $13.2B | Research, training programs |
| Investment tax credit | 25% | Capex offset for qualifying investments |
| **Total** | ~$52.7B | Over 5 years |

**Key restrictions:**
- Recipients cannot expand advanced capacity in [[China]] for 10 years
- Must comply with reporting and clawback provisions
- Workforce and environmental requirements

## All major recipients

| Company | Direct subsidies | Loans | Use |
|---------|------------------|-------|-----|
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | $8.5B | $11B | Ohio, Arizona, Oregon, New [[Mexico]] |
| [[TSMC]] | $6.6B | $5B | Arizona (3 fabs) |
| [[Samsung]] | $6.4B | — | Taylor, Texas |
| [[GlobalFoundries]] | $1.5B | — | Malta, NY (specialty) |
| [[Micron]] | $6.1B | $7.5B | New York, Idaho (memory) |
| [[SK Hynix]] | $450M | — | Indiana ([[HBM]] packaging) |
| Polar Semiconductor | $120M | — | Minnesota (specialty) |

**Note:** Preliminary agreements; final amounts may vary.

## Funding timeline

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 2022 | Act signed (Aug 9) |
| 2023 | Commerce Department sets up process |
| 2024 | Major awards announced ([[Intel]], TSMC, Samsung) |
| 2025 | Funds disbursing as milestones hit |
| 2026-27 | First subsidized fabs operational |

---

## Strategic intent

**Why the US did this:**

| Goal | Details |
|------|---------|
| Reduce [[Taiwan]] dependence | ~90% of advanced chips made in [[Taiwan]] |
| Counter [[China]] | Respond to [[China]]'s $150B+ chip subsidies |
| National security | DoD needs domestic advanced production |
| Economic competitiveness | Semiconductor jobs, supply chain control |

**The bipartisan logic:** Both parties agree on strategic competition with [[China]].

## Guardrails ([[China]] restrictions)

**What recipients cannot do:**

| Restriction | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Expand advanced capacity in [[China]] | 10 years |
| Transfer technology to [[China]] | Indefinite |
| Joint ventures with Chinese firms | Case-by-case |

**Affected companies:**
- [[Intel]] had to sell stake in Chinese memory JV
- Samsung limited in [[China]] expansion
- TSMC's Nanjing fab restricted to mature nodes

---

## Limitations

**What CHIPS Act doesn't solve:**

| Issue | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Cost gap | US fabs still 30-50% more expensive than [[Asia]] |
| [[Execution risk in foundries]] | Subsidies don't fix yield or talent issues |
| Timeline | 3-5 years before subsidized fabs operational |
| Scale | US will have ~10-15% of advanced capacity, not independence |
| Workforce | Skilled fab workers take years to train |

**The insurance problem:**
- US fabs are "insurance" against [[Taiwan]] scenario
- But insurance assumes the insured asset survives
- Arizona can't *replace* [[Taiwan]], only provide partial continuity

---

## Effectiveness assessment

**What it accomplishes:**
- Makes US fabs financially viable (improved IRR)
- Brings TSMC, Samsung, [[Intel]] to build domestically
- Creates nucleus of domestic workforce
- Reduces worst-case [[Taiwan]] disruption impact

**What it doesn't accomplish:**
- True semiconductor independence
- Cost parity with [[Asia]]
- Elimination of [[China]] threat
- Quick results (5+ year timeline)

---

## Investment implications

**Beneficiaries:**
- [[GlobalFoundries]] — CHIPS Act funding + specialty niche
- Equipment suppliers — US fab buildout creates demand
- Construction/materials — Multi-year build cycle

**Watch for:**
- Milestone-based disbursement (can be delayed)
- Political uncertainty (administration changes)
- Cost overruns at subsidized projects
