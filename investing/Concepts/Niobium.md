**Niobium** (Nb) — Critical mineral with the most concentrated supply chain of any major industrial metal. [[Brazil]] produces 92% of global output; one company ([[CBMM]]) controls 77%. Used primarily in steel alloys (77% of demand), aerospace superalloys (21%), and increasingly in EV batteries. 100% import-dependent for both the US and [[China]].

## Why niobium matters

Micro-additions of niobium to steel raise tensile strength by up to 30% while preserving weldability. Modern vehicles contain ~1.8 kg of niobium per tonne of steel, up from 1.2 kg a decade ago. No other alloying element delivers equivalent performance at comparable cost and weight.

Beyond steel, niobium is the backbone of superconducting technology — niobium-titanium (NbTi) and niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) alloys are used in MRI machines, particle accelerators, fusion reactors, and quantum computing (Josephson junctions in superconducting qubits).

## Applications

| Sector | Use | Share of demand | Substitutability |
|--------|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| HSLA steel | Structural, automotive, pipelines | 77% | Limited (vanadium, molybdenum — inferior) |
| Superalloys | Jet engines, rocket nozzles, hypersonics | 21% | Very limited (C-103 alloy irreplaceable) |
| Superconductors | MRI, particle physics, fusion, quantum | <2% | None |
| Batteries | NTO anodes (fast-charge Li-ion) | Emerging | Early stage |
| Capacitors | Can substitute for tantalum | <1% | Bidirectional |

### Defense applications

| System | Niobium role |
|--------|-------------|
| Jet engines | Superalloy turbine blades (withstand >1,200C) |
| Hypersonic missiles | C-103 alloy for airframes and nozzles |
| Nuclear reactors | Structural components |
| MRI (military hospitals) | NbTi superconducting magnets |
| Quantum computing | Josephson junctions |

## Supply concentration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [[Brazil]] production share | 92% (~99,400 tonnes Nb content, 2024) |
| [[Canada]] production share | ~7% (~7,600 tonnes) |
| [[CBMM]] market share | 77% |
| [[CMOC Group]] market share | ~11% |
| [[Magris Performance Materials]] share | ~8-10% |
| World total production | ~108,000 tonnes (2024) |
| US domestic production | Zero since 1959 |
| US import dependence | 100% |
| [[China]] import dependence | 100% |
| EU sourcing from Brazil | 92% |

This is the most concentrated supply chain of any critical mineral — more concentrated than [[Gallium]] (99% [[China]]) because a single private company controls the majority.

### [[CBMM]] ownership

| Shareholder | Stake |
|-------------|-------|
| Moreira Salles family | 70% |
| Japanese/Korean consortium ([[Sojitz]] et al.) | 15% |
| Chinese consortium | 15% (~$1.95B acquisition) |

The Chinese consortium's 15% stake in [[CBMM]], combined with [[CMOC Group]]'s ownership of the Boa Vista mine (second-largest operation), gives [[China]] significant influence across the niobium supply chain despite [[Brazil]]'s production dominance.

## Market size and pricing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global market (2024) | ~$2.9B |
| Forecast (2032) | ~$4.7B (7.0% CAGR) |
| Volume (2025) | ~80 kilotonnes |
| Forecast volume (2031) | ~103 kilotonnes |
| Ferroniobium price | ~$25-45/kg Nb (grade-dependent) |
| High-purity Nb2O5 | >$50/kg |

Price characteristics: Notably stable compared to other metals. No exchange-traded futures market — [[CBMM]]'s dominant position makes it effectively a price-setter. No speculative trading. Prices rose from ~$340M US import value (2021) to ~$440M (2022) on post-COVID steel recovery, then stabilized.

- Oil & gas pipeline construction

Aerospace expansion:
- Global aircraft fleet projected to double from ~24,700 (2024) to ~49,200 by 2044
- Hypersonic weapons programs driving C-103 alloy demand
- Additive manufacturing for spherical C-103 powder

EV batteries (emerging):
- [[CBMM]]/[[Toshiba]] niobium titanium oxide (NTO) anode: 80% charge in 10 minutes, 15,000-cycle lifespan
- [[Toshiba]] began sample shipments of SCiB-Nb cells (June 2025)
- Volkswagen prototype e-bus demonstrated with NTO battery
- [[CBMM]] targeting 25-30% of revenue from non-steel products by 2030
- 3 additional plants for battery-grade niobium oxide planned, targeting 20kt production by 2030

Superconductors & quantum:
- Quantum computing investments exceeded $2.4B in 2024
- Fusion reactor programs (Nb3Sn magnets)
- MRI installations growing in emerging markets

Geographic shift: Asia-Pacific accounts for 60% of demand (2025), growing at 4.7% CAGR.

## Niobium vs other critical minerals

| Mineral | Top producer control | US import dependence | Substitute | Defense use |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Niobium | [[Brazil]] 92% | 100% | Limited | Superalloys, hypersonics |
| [[Antimony]] | [[China]] 48% | High | None (ammunition) | Primers |
| [[Gallium]] | [[China]] 99% | High | Limited | Radar, [[5G]] |
| [[Germanium]] | [[China]] 60% | High | Some | Fiber, IR |
| [[Rare earth elements]] | [[China]] 70% | High | Limited | Magnets, motors |

Niobium's risk profile is distinct: lower geopolitical adversary control than Ga/Ge (Brazil is a US ally), but extreme single-entity concentration ([[CBMM]]) and zero domestic production.

## Investment implications

Direct plays:
- [[NioCorp Developments]] (NIOBF) — Only US niobium project. Development stage, OTC
- [[CMOC Group]] (HKEX: 3993) — Second-largest producer
- [[Critical Metals Corp]] (CRML) — Tanbreez project includes niobium as secondary mineral

Indirect beneficiaries:
- Steel companies adopting HSLA specifications

- [[Toshiba]] — NTO battery commercialization

Risk factors:
- [[CBMM]] price-setting power limits upside for competitors
- No futures market means no hedging mechanism
- [[NioCorp Developments]] faces $1.1B capex and EXIM financing dependency
- Chinese influence across supply chain (CBMM stake + CMOC) despite Brazilian production dominance
