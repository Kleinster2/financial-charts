# AI infrastructure financing risk

The $1.4T AI buildout may rely on circular capital flows — each player's solvency depends on others honoring commitments.

---

## The "Ouroboros Protocol"

Capital circulates within ecosystem rather than entering from outside:

```
SoftBank → OpenAI → Oracle → NVIDIA → (back to ecosystem)
```

If one link breaks, cascade risk.

## Player-specific risks

| Player | Exposure | Red flag |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **SoftBank** | $40B OpenAI bet | 54.6% Arm concentration, margin call at -40% |
| **Oracle** | 57% backlog = OpenAI | CDS 124-139 bps (2008 levels), CEO selling |
| **OpenAI** | $115B losses through 2029 | $1.4T commitment, ~$140B secured |
| **CoreWeave** | 65% revenue = Microsoft | CDS 773 bps = 42% default probability |
| **NVIDIA** | Vendor financing | "Investment" = 3.5x GPU purchase multiplier |

---

## Infrastructure bottlenecks

| Constraint | Lead time |
|------------|-----------|
| Large power transformers | 120-210 weeks |
| Labor shortage | 300K demand vs 439K sector deficit |
| GPU obsolescence | Faster than depreciation assumptions |

See [[Power constraints]] for demand-side analysis.

## Historical parallel

**1999-2001 fiber optic bubble:**
- $1.7T invested
- 2.7% utilization rates
- $2T market cap destruction

**Key difference:** GPUs depreciate faster than fiber — compressed timeline for demand realization.

## Implications for theses

**Adds risk to:**
- [[AI hyperscalers]] — capex sustainability questioned
- [[Long Broadcom]] — depends on hyperscaler spending
- [[Long WFE]] — fab buildout tied to financing

**Reinforces:**
- [[Long Anthropic]] — capital efficiency matters if music stops
- [[Power constraints]] — infrastructure can't keep pace

**Neutral:**
- [[Long memory]] — shortage is real regardless of financing
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — relative value less affected

## What to watch

- [ ] CoreWeave refinancing success
- [ ] Oracle debt trajectory
- [ ] SoftBank margin situation
- [ ] OpenAI revenue vs burn updates
- [ ] Hyperscaler capex guidance cuts

## Counter-argument

Bulls would say:
- Hyperscalers (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) have balance sheets to absorb losses
- AI demand is real (coding, agents working)
- Infrastructure constraints = pricing power for winners
- Not all players are equally fragile

The risk is concentrated in second-tier players (Oracle, CoreWeave, SoftBank) — Tier 1 hyperscalers may survive while others fail.
