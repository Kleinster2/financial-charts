**Activist short selling** — Investment strategy combining short positions with public research reports alleging fraud, accounting manipulation, or business deterioration. Practitioners profit from stock declines triggered by their own exposés. Pioneered by [[Muddy Waters]] (2010), the strategy has exposed billions in fraud but faces regulatory scrutiny and legal risk.

## How it works

1. **Research** — Deep forensic analysis: financial statements, channel checks, on-the-ground investigation, whistleblower tips
2. **Position** — Take short position (borrow shares, sell, buy back cheaper) or buy puts before publishing
3. **Publish** — Release detailed report with allegations, often with provocative titles
4. **Profit** — Stock drops on report; close position for gain
5. **Defend** — Media appearances, rebuttals to company responses

The model's power comes from information asymmetry — short sellers often spend months researching what takes markets hours to reprice.

## The scorecard

### Hindenburg Research (2017-2025)

Before disbanding, Hindenburg's campaigns resulted in:
- **65 people** facing fraud charges
- **24 individuals** criminally indicted
- **7 others** facing foreign sanctions

Notable campaigns:
| Target | Year | Allegation | Outcome |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| **Nikola** | 2020 | Faked truck demo | Founder convicted, 4 years; company bankrupt Feb 2025 |
| **Adani Group** | 2023 | Stock manipulation, offshore entities | -$150B market cap |
| **Icahn Enterprises** | 2023 | Ponzi-like structure | Stock -50% |
| **Block (Square)** | 2023 | Compliance failures | Ongoing |

Anderson closed Hindenburg citing the "intense" toll of the work.

### Muddy Waters track record

8 companies delisted, 2 settled with regulators. ~19% annualized returns over 5 years (through 2021).

## Regulatory crackdown

### DOJ investigation (2021-2024)

The DOJ and SEC launched a broad investigation into short sellers in 2021, examining:
- Relationships between hedge funds and researchers
- Trading around report publication
- Potential market manipulation

**Carson Block (Muddy Waters)** — Received SEC close-out letter (no charges filed)

**Andrew Left (Citron)** — Indicted July 2024 on 19 counts:
- Allegedly traded ahead of reports using short-dated options
- Closed positions at prices different from public recommendations
- Fabricated invoices to hide hedge fund relationships
- Faces up to 25 years if convicted
- Pleaded not guilty; case pending

The Left prosecution raises questions about whether publishing research while holding positions is inherently problematic — a practice common across Wall Street.

## Bull market challenges

Activist shorts struggle in sustained bull markets:
- **Momentum overwhelms fundamentals** — Fraudulent companies can keep rising
- **Meme stock risk** — Retail coordinated squeezes (GameStop 2021)
- **Quantum/AI froth** — Kerrisdale shorted D-Wave (-370% loss), IonQ (-250% loss) in 2024

Many firms have pivoted to:
- Longer holding periods
- Hedged structures
- Waiting for catalysts rather than creating them

## The ethics debate

**Pro:**
- Expose fraud regulators miss
- Provide market efficiency
- SEC whistleblower program has paid ~$300M to activist shorts
- "Information wants to be free"

**Con:**
- Profit from destruction
- Can target legitimate companies
- Coordinated attacks on foreign companies (Adani critics in India)
- Trading ahead of own reports

The Andrew Left case may establish new legal boundaries for the practice.
