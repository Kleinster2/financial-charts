**US Sanctions** — US economic restrictions on countries, companies, individuals. Key lever for semiconductor and energy policy.

## Sanctions in AI/semiconductor context

| [[Target]] | Sanctions | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[China]] | Chip export controls | [[Export controls]] on advanced AI chips |
| Huawei | Entity list | Cut off from US tech |
| Russia | Broad sanctions | Limited chip access |
| [[Venezuela]] | [[Oil]] sanctions | Production collapsed, [[Chevron]] license |

---

## Types of sanctions

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Entity List | Companies banned from US tech |
| SDN List | Individuals/entities frozen out of USD system |
| Sectoral | [[Target]] specific industries |
| Secondary | Punish third parties dealing with targets |
| **Tariff-based (NEW)** | Use tariffs to punish third parties (Jan 2026) |

See [[Secondary sanctions]] for detailed analysis of both traditional and tariff-based approaches.

## Tariffs as secondary sanctions (Jan 2026)

**Novel approach:** Trump using tariffs instead of traditional financial sanctions to enforce secondary sanctions.

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jan 12, 2026 | Trump announces 25% tariff on any country "doing business with [[Iran]]" |
| — | "Effective immediately" via Truth Social |
| — | No formal executive action published |

**How it differs from traditional sanctions:**

| Traditional (OFAC) | Tariff-based (IEEPA) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Freezes assets, blocks USD access | Raises import costs |
| Binary (sanctioned or not) | Graduated (% rate) |
| Enforced by Treasury | Enforced by Customs |
| Clear legal framework | Novel, legally uncertain |

**Targets:**
- [[China]] (90%+ of Iran oil trade) — could face 74%+ total tariff
- [[India]], UAE, Turkey — major Iran trading partners

**Legal basis:** International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — same authority used for [[China]] tariffs, currently under Supreme Court challenge.

**Investment implication:** Blurs line between trade policy and sanctions. Third-country exposure now includes tariff risk, not just financial sanctions risk.

See [[Iran]], [[US-China tariffs]].

## Russia oil secondary sanctions

Traditional secondary sanctions approach (contrast with Iran tariff approach).

### Mechanism

| Tool | Detail |
|------|--------|
| G7 price cap | $60/barrel ceiling on Russian oil |
| Shadow fleet sanctions | ~600 vessels designated by [[EU]] |
| Secondary sanctions | [[Rosneft]] + Lukoil (50% of Russian production) |
| Enforcement | OFAC, Treasury, seizures |

### Jan 2025 package

- 180+ shadow fleet tankers designated
- [[Rosneft]], Lukoil added to SDN list
- Blocks US financial system access for non-US entities doing business with them

### 2026 enforcement

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Jan 2, 2026 | Finland seized freighter *Fitburg* |
| Jan 7, 2026 | US Navy/Coast Guard seized tanker *Marinera* |
| Nov 2025 | Ukraine drone strikes on shadow fleet tankers |

### Effectiveness

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Russian oil exports | Largely stable |
| Russian oil revenues | Slightly reduced |
| Shadow fleet share | ~27% of Russian crude |

**Challenge:** Shadow fleet, non-Western insurance, [[China]]/[[India]] buyers evading.

### Russia vs Iran: Two approaches

| | Russia (traditional) | Iran (tariff-based) |
|--|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Tool** | OFAC SDN list, seizures | 25% tariff on trading partners |
| **[[Target]]** | Specific companies, vessels | Entire countries |
| **Legal basis** | Established sanctions law | IEEPA (novel, challenged) |
| **Enforcement** | Treasury, Navy | Customs (unclear) |
| **Effectiveness** | Leaky but functional | Untested |

See [[Russia]] for full context.

## Visa sanctions on allied officials (Feb 2026)

New vector: using personal visa revocations against allied government officials to block Chinese infrastructure projects.

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Feb 20, 2026 | State Dept revokes visas for [[Chile]]'s Transport Minister + two [[Subtel]] officials |
| Trigger | Advancing [[Chile-China Express]] submarine cable (Valparaiso → Hong Kong, [[China Mobile]]) |
| Rationale | "Compromised critical telecommunications infrastructure and undermined regional security" |

First time the US sanctioned a sitting allied cabinet minister over telecom infrastructure. Distinct from Entity List or OFAC sanctions — this is State Dept visa authority used to personally punish allied officials who engage Chinese companies.

The US prefers the [[Humboldt Cable]] (Google/NEC, Chile → Australia) — Western-aligned alternative already under installation.

LatAm signal: message to [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] about consequences of Chinese infrastructure engagement.

See [[US Chile cable visa sanctions]] for full details.

## Key agencies

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| [[BIS]] (Commerce) | Export controls, Entity List |
| [[OFAC]] (Treasury) | Financial sanctions, SDN List |
| State Dept | Diplomatic coordination, visa sanctions on allied officials (new) |

See [[US Government]] for full policy landscape.

---

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| New sanctions | [[Target]] companies fall, alternatives rise |
| Sanctions lifted | [[Target]] companies rally |
| Secondary sanctions | Third-party exposure risk |
| Evasion | Compliance risk for enablers |

---

## Current hot spots

| [[Target]] | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[China]] chips | Escalating controls |
| [[China]] telecom infra | Visa sanctions on allied officials (Chile, Feb 2026) |
| Russia | Comprehensive |
| Venezuela | Partial lift ([[Chevron]] license), now [[Maduro capture 2026]] |
| Iran | Comprehensive |
