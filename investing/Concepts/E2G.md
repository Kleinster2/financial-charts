**E2G (second-generation ethanol)** — cellulosic ethanol produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks (plant fiber) rather than sugar/starch. Deeper carbon reduction than 1G ethanol, no food-vs-fuel conflict.

## 1G vs 2G

| Dimension | 1G (first-gen) | 2G (second-gen) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Feedstock | Corn kernels, sugarcane juice | [[Biomass]]: bagasse, corn stover, straw, wood |
| GHG reduction vs gasoline | 39-52% | ~86% |
| Food competition | Yes (food crops diverted) | No (uses agricultural waste) |
| Cost (USD/gal) | ~$1.82 | $2.17-4.55 |
| Global capacity | ~18.5B gal/yr (US alone) | <200M liters globally |

---

## Key producers

| Producer | Location | Capacity | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **[[Raizen]]** | Brazil (Bonfim) | 82M L/yr (world's largest) | Commercial (2024) |
| [[Raizen]] pipeline | Brazil | 1.6B L/yr target (20 units) | EUR 4B contracted |
| POET-DSM (Project LIBERTY) | Iowa, US | 95M L/yr | Commercial (2014) |
| [[Clariant]] (sunliquid) | Romania | ~50K tons/yr | Commercial (2022) |

[[Raizen]]'s cost advantage ($2.17/gal) stems from cheap sugarcane [[Biomass|bagasse]] — structurally lower than US corn stover ($90/dry MT vs $38-40/MT).

## Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2G production cost | $2.17-4.55/gal |
| 1G (corn ethanol) | ~$1.82/gal |
| Enzyme cost | $79.25/unit (20-40x corn ethanol) |
| Oil price breakeven | ~$100/bbl (without subsidies) |
| Carbon credit premium | ~$20-50/ton CO2 (RenovaBio CBIOs) |

**Enzyme cost is THE lever** — if immobilized/co-expressed enzymes cut costs 50%, E2G approaches 1G parity.

---

## Policy tailwinds

| Policy | Region | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **RenovaBio** | [[Brazil]] | Carbon credits (CBIOs) for low-carbon fuel producers |
| **RFS2** | US | Mandates 36B gal renewable fuel; $1.01/gal tax credit |
| **RED III** | EU | Tightened GHG thresholds favor 2G over 1G |

---

## Technology challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Enzyme costs | 20-40x higher than corn ethanol enzymes |
| Pretreatment | Lignin recalcitrance blocks cellulose access |
| Pentose fermentation | Standard yeast can't ferment xylose/arabinose |
| Fermentation inhibitors | Pretreatment creates furfural, acetic acid |
| Scale | <200M liters global vs 70B+ liters 1G |

## Integrated biorefinery model

[[Raizen]]'s approach — zero waste:
1. Sugarcane juice → 1G [[Ethanol]]
2. Bagasse → E2G cellulosic [[Ethanol]]
3. Residual bagasse + lignin → [[Biomass]] power co-generation (1.3 GW)

Dual output (fuel + electricity) improves unit economics vs standalone E2G.

---

## Investment angle

**Bull case:**
- 86% GHG reduction vs gasoline — premium carbon credits
- Feedstock abundance (2B+ dry MT/yr globally)
- Policy frameworks de-risk offtake (EUR 4B contracted at Raizen)
- Enzyme breakthroughs approaching 1G cost parity

**Bear case:**
- Still 50-150% more expensive than 1G in most markets
- Technology risk — many companies failed to scale (Abengoa, Gevo)
- EV adoption may shrink liquid fuel demand
- Feedstock competition (animal feed, biogas, power gen)
