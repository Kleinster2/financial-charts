# Abenomics

The economic policy framework launched by PM [[Shinzo Abe]] in 2012 to break [[Japan]]'s [[Japan lost decades|deflationary cycle]]. Three "arrows": aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reform. Laid the groundwork for Japan's corporate governance revolution but operated in a deflationary environment that limited its impact. [[Sanae Takaichi]]'s successor program operates in a fundamentally different context — inflation, not deflation.

## The three arrows

| Arrow | Description | Outcome |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Monetary easing | [[BOJ]] "Kuroda bazooka" — massive QE, negative rates, yield curve control | Weakened yen, boosted exporters, but failed to generate sustained inflation |
| Fiscal stimulus | Government spending packages | Stop-start; offset by 2014 consumption tax hike (8%→10% path) |
| Structural reform | Corporate governance, womenomics, labor market flexibility | Most enduring legacy — see [[Japan corporate governance revolution]] |

## Key reforms

- 2014: Japan Stewardship Code — institutional investors expected to engage with companies
- 2015: Corporate Governance Code — independent directors, capital efficiency mandates
- Womenomics: policies supporting female workforce participation → Japan now among highest in OECD
- [[NISA]] accounts: tax-advantaged investment accounts (Japan's 401k equivalent)

## Abenomics vs Takaichi-nomics

[[Mireya Solís]] ([[Brookings Institution]]) frames the key differences:

| Dimension | Abenomics (2012-2020) | Takaichi era (2025-) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Inflation context | Deflationary | ~3% inflation |
| Primary tool | Monetary policy (BOJ) | Fiscal/industrial policy |
| Government role | Market-oriented reforms | Big government, targeted spending |
| Fiscal stance | Relatively restrained | Expansionary (record budget) |
| Defense | Constitutional constraints | Defense industry as priority sector |
| Trade | Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) | Post-Trump protectionism |
| Governance reform | Initiated codes | Deepened with tax incentives (7% productivity credit, 50% R&D credit) |

The international environment has changed fundamentally — Abe's market-oriented globalism has given way to Takaichi's industrial policy and fiscal activism.

## Legacy

Abe was assassinated in July 2022. Every successor PM ([[Yoshihide Suga]], [[Fumio Kishida]], [[Shigeru Ishiba]], [[Sanae Takaichi]]) has continued and deepened his governance reform agenda. [[Hiromi Yamaji]] ([[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]): "All of them were quite big supporters of the governance reform, because all of them were convinced that growth of the private sector is essential."
