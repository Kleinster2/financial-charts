**Blue city fiscal crisis** — Structural pattern across large US cities under sustained one-party Democratic governance: budgets growing faster than inflation, economic output, and population; rising per-capita fiscal burden as residents leave; social spending without accountability; subsidies that bid up prices rather than solve underlying problems; and pension obligations consuming growing budget shares. Observable in New York, [[Los Angeles]], and Chicago, among others.

## The pattern

| Dynamic | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Budget growth > GDP growth | Spending compounds faster than the tax base |
| Population stagnation/decline | Fewer taxpayers splitting a larger bill |
| Subsidy trap | Transfer payments bid up prices (housing, services) rather than expanding supply |
| Accountability gap | Spending increases without outcome tracking |
| Pension overhang | Deferred obligations consume growing share of operating budgets |
| Tax maximization | High marginal rates drive domestic outmigration; partially offset by immigration |

## Case studies

### New York City

See [[NYC real estate]] for housing-specific fiscal data.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 budget (proposed) | $127B |
| Bloomberg's last budget (FY2014) | ~$70B |
| Budget growth | ~2x in a decade (faster than inflation and city GDP) |
| Population | -5% Apr 2020–Jul 2022; still below 2020 baseline as of 2024 |
| Per capita spending (2023) | 30%+ above LA, >2x Houston (Lincoln Institute, fiscally standardized) |
| Combined top income tax (state+city) | 14.776% |
| Combined marginal rate (high earners) | >50%, ~55% on investment income |
| Combined corporate tax rate | 17.44% — highest in US (Citizen's Budget Commission) |
| Property tax share of ownership | >27% (2022), above national average |
| Rental assistance | $263M (FY2020) → $1.34B (most recent FY) — 5x increase; housing costs worsened |
| DOE budget | ~$34B (2019) → $40B+; enrollment shrinking |
| Per-pupil spending (projected FY2026) | ~$35,000 — among highest nationally; outcomes middling |

[[Zohran Mamdani]] proposes further income/corporate tax hikes or ~10% property tax increase.

### Los Angeles — homelessness spending

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| City homelessness budget (FY25-26) | $900M | Mayor Bass budget proposal |
| County homeless initiative (FY25-26) | $908M (Measure A) | LA County |
| 2023 count — countywide | 75,518 (+9% YoY) | LAHSA |
| 2023 count — City of LA | 46,260 (+10% YoY) | LAHSA |
| Since 2015 — countywide | +70% | LAHSA historical data |
| Since 2015 — City of LA | +80% (2023 peak) | LAHSA historical data |
| 2025 count — countywide | 72,308 (-4% YoY) | LAHSA |
| 2025 count — City of LA | 43,699 (-3.4% YoY) | LAHSA |

The audit: Alvarez & Marsal audited $2.4B in city homelessness spending (Jun 2020–Jun 2024), commissioned by US District Judge David O. Carter. Key findings:
- Could not trace substantial funds allocated to city programs
- LAHSA failed to document ~2,300 housing sites
- 70% of contracts for those sites disclosed no expenses in the prior year
- $15M in outstanding cash advances to providers (some dating to 2016) unrepaid

RAND study (Oct 2025): official count undercounts by up to 32% in key neighborhoods (Skid Row captured 61%, Hollywood 81%, Venice 76%). Undercount worsened sharply from ~5% (2022-23) to 32% (2025) as encampment removals pushed people into harder-to-count locations.

LA County creating new department to replace LAHSA by Jul 2026, pulling functions under Board of Supervisors oversight.

### Chicago — pension crisis

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Unfunded pension liability | $35.9B (FY2024 official) | City ACFR |
| Alternative estimate | $55.4B (Equable Institute / GASB) | ~34.5% funded |
| Official funded ratio | ~25% | $1 in assets per $4 in obligations |
| FY2026 budget (all funds) | ~$16.6B | City of Chicago |
| Pension + debt service share | ~40% of operating budget | vs NYC ~17%, LA ~11% |
| FY2026 budget shortfall | $1.15B | Closed via ~$500M in new taxes/fees |
| New pension law impact | +$11B to unfunded liability | Police/fire benefit enhancement |

Mayor [[Brandon Johnson]] (since May 2023): approval 6.6% (Feb 2025, M3 Strategies), 14% (Jan 2025, Illinois Policy/Lincoln), 26% (Aug 2025, UChicago/NORC), 31% (Oct 2025, Sun-Times). Top voter concerns: crime (67%), high taxes (54%), inflation (41%).

Jan 2026: city split advance pension payment due to cash crunch. S&P revised Chicago debt outlook from stable to negative.

Population: 2,721,308 (Jul 2024) — up from 2023 but still down ~27,000 from Apr 2020. Recent growth driven by international migration (Venezuelan, Ukrainian arrivals); domestic outmigration continues.

## Subsidy trap dynamics

The pattern repeats: spending increases fail to improve outcomes because transfer payments flow into price inflation rather than supply expansion.

- NYC rental assistance: $263M → $1.34B (5x) while housing costs worsened
- LA homelessness: $2.4B over 4 years; audit couldn't track outcomes; counts kept rising
- Chicago pensions: $2.76B annual contribution (FY2026) for a 25%-funded system

[[Matt Yglesias]] supply-side argument: build abundant market-rate housing to expand the tax base and make budgets affordable, rather than subsidize demand into a supply-constrained market.
