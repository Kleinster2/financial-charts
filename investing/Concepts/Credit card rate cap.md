## Why banks oppose

| Argument | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Profitability** | 10% cap makes most card lending unprofitable |
| **Credit access** | Would cut off subprime borrowers |
| **Account closures** | Industry warns 175M accounts could close |
| **Alternative lenders** | Pushes consumers to less regulated options |

**Citigroup CFO Mark Mason:**
> "An interest rate cap is not something that we would or could support... it would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most."

**American Bankers Association:**
> "If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives."

## Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Credit card spending | 30-40% of total consumer spending |
| Impact if tightened | ~5% reduction in consumer spending ([[Morgan Stanley]]) |
| [[Consumer]] savings (if enacted) | ~$100B/year (Vanderbilt research) |
| Subprime cutoff risk | Credit scores <600 likely denied |

**The tradeoff:** Lower rates for existing borrowers vs. credit access for marginal borrowers.

---

## Enforcement question

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| Executive order | Unclear authority |
| Congressional legislation | Bill stalled (10% cap for 5 years) |
| Regulatory action | No existing law to enforce |
| Moral suasion | [[Banks]] not complying |

**Five days after announcement:** No formal guidance from administration. [[Banks]] "wagering they can fend off" the proposal.

**Trump:** "[[Banks]] that don't comply would be in violation of the law."

**Reality:** No US law currently caps credit card rates.

## Historical precedent

### Arkansas (17% cap)

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Cap level | 17% (strictly enforced) |
| Result | Poor and less creditworthy cut out of consumer credit |
| Research | 10% cap would exclude credit scores <600 |

### Usury laws history

- Most states repealed rate caps in 1970s-80s
- [[Banks]] chartered in favorable states (Delaware, South Dakota)
- Effective deregulation of card rates since 1978 (Marquette decision)

## Bank strategies

| Response | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Compliance refusal** | No bank has agreed to cap |
| **Account closures** | Threatened for unprofitable accounts |
| **Fee increases** | Annual fees could rise |
| **Credit tightening** | Stricter underwriting |
| **Lobbying** | ABA leading opposition |

---

## Who's most exposed

| Tier | Companies | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **High** | Synchrony, [[Capital One]], Discover | Pure-play consumer credit |
| **Medium** | [[Citigroup]], [[Bank of America]] | Large card portfolios |
| **Lower** | [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Wells Fargo]] | Diversified, but still exposed |
| **Indirect** | [[Visa]], [[Mastercard]] | Volume decline risk |

---

## Investment implications

| Scenario | Positioning |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cap fails (most likely)** | Bank stocks recover, buy the dip |
| **Cap implemented** | Short consumer lenders, long diversified banks |
| **Compromise (15-18% cap)** | Moderate impact, subprime tightening |
| **Prolonged uncertainty** | Multiple compression for card-heavy banks |
