## Thesis

Original [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] thesis assumed all white-collar service companies face disruption. Performance revealed two categories:

| Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Victims** | TRI, FDS, TCS, INFY | Value-add commoditized, pricing power eroding |
| **Winners** | HCL, Publicis | Repositioning as AI enablers |

**HCL Tech** differentiation:
- Engineering services focus vs TCS/INFY commoditized BPO
- AI implementation partner for enterprises
- Benefits from AI infrastructure buildout (picks and shovels)

**Publicis** differentiation:
- Epsilon acquisition gives first-party data moat
- Data-driven marketing vs pure creative production
- Already pivoted before AI wave hit
