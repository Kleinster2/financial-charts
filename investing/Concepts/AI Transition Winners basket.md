# AI Transition Winners basket

Stocks initially expected to be AI disruption victims that are instead repositioning as AI implementation beneficiaries. Splintered from [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] after performance divergence.

**The result:** AITW +70% vs AIWD +7% since July 2021. The "winners vs victims" split was the right call.

## Constituents

| Ticker | Company | Weight | Why a winner |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| HCLTECH.NS | [[HCL Tech]] | 50% | Engineering focus (vs commoditized BPO), AI implementation partner |
| PUB.PA | [[Publicis]] | 50% | Epsilon first-party data moat, data-driven marketing pivot |

**Total: 100%** — equal weight

## Thesis

Original [[AI workflow disruption basket|AIWD]] thesis assumed all white-collar service companies face disruption. Performance revealed two categories:

| Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Victims** | TRI, FDS, TCS, INFY | Value-add commoditized, pricing power eroding |
| **Winners** | HCL, Publicis | Repositioning as AI enablers |

**HCL Tech** differentiation:
- Engineering services focus vs TCS/INFY commoditized BPO
- AI implementation partner for enterprises
- Benefits from AI infrastructure buildout (picks and shovels)

**Publicis** differentiation:
- Epsilon acquisition gives first-party data moat
- Data-driven marketing vs pure creative production
- Already pivoted before AI wave hit

## Performance

![[aitw-aiwd-spy.png]]
*AITW (blue) +70% vs AIWD (red) +7% vs SPY (green) +65% since July 2021. Transition winners beat the market; disruption victims got destroyed.*

| Period | AITW | SPY | AIWD | AITW vs AIWD |
|--------|------|-----|------|--------------|
| July 2021 – Feb 2026 | **+70%** | +65% | +7% | **+63pp** |

**Key insight:** The splinter wasn't just about avoiding losses. HCL and Publicis actually outperformed the S&P 500 while their former basket-mates collapsed. Same sector exposure, radically different AI positioning.
