**MiCA** — Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. EU-wide regulatory framework for crypto-assets that took full effect in December 2024. Requires stablecoin issuers to hold 60% of reserves in European banks, maintain 1:1 backing, and obtain e-money institution authorization. Led directly to [[Tether|USDT]] being delisted from all major EU-regulated exchanges by July 2025.
