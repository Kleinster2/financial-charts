## Why green bonds matter

Dedicated financing for climate transition:

- **Scale**: $6.2T cumulative market — now mainstream fixed income
- **Maturity wall**: 2025-26 wave of maturing bonds = reinvestment opportunity
- **Regulation-driven**: EU Taxonomy, CSRD, SFDR driving European leadership
- **Transition finance**: Growing issuance from carbon-intensive sectors (steel, aviation, energy)

## How green bonds work

**Issuance process:**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Framework | Issuer creates Green Bond Framework documenting eligible uses |
| 2. SPO | Third party ([[Sustainalytics]], Vigeo Eiris, ISS ESG) provides [[Second-Party Opinion]] confirming alignment with standards |
| 3. Issuance | Bonds sold under framework, proceeds tracked in dedicated account |
| 4. Reporting | Annual allocation + impact reports to investors |

**Green Bond Framework contents:**
- **Use of Proceeds** — Eligible categories (renewables, efficiency, green buildings, clean transport)
- **Project Selection** — Criteria for qualifying projects
- **Management of Proceeds** — How funds are tracked and allocated
- **Reporting Commitment** — Annual disclosure on allocation and impact

**Standards:** Most frameworks align with **ICMA Green Bond Principles** (voluntary guidelines). EU Green Bond Standard (mandatory for "European Green Bond" label) requires EU Taxonomy alignment.

**Why it matters:** Investors need assurance "green" money funds green projects. Framework + SPO + reporting creates accountability. Without this, it's just marketing.

**Example:** [[Scala Data Centers]] created their framework before Dec 2022 R$2B issuance. [[Sustainalytics]] SPO confirmed eligible uses: PUE <1.40 data centers, 100% renewable energy, green certifications. All subsequent Scala green debentures (SCLL13, SCLL14, SCLL24) issue under the same framework.
