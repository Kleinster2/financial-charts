## Carney's China pivot

**January 2026 visit highlights:**
- Met [[Xi Jinping]] in Beijing
- First Canadian PM to visit since Trudeau (2017)
- Signaled desire to "stabilize relations"

## Constraints on thaw

| **Huawei [[5G]] ban** | Still in place, irritant |

## Comparison to peers

| Country | China stance (2026) |
|---------|---------------------|
| **[[Canada]]** | Thawing — Carney pivot |
| [[Australia]] | Thawed 2023 under Albanese |
| [[UK]] | Cool — limited engagement |
| US | Adversarial — tariffs, tech war |
| [[EU]] | "De-risking" — selective engagement |

[[Canada]] following [[Australia]]'s path: pragmatic re-engagement while maintaining security red lines.
