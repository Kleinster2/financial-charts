## Carney's China pivot

January 2026 visit highlights:
- Met [[Xi Jinping]] in Beijing
- First Canadian PM to visit since Trudeau (2017)
- Signaled desire to "stabilize relations"
- Explicitly seeking reduced US economic dependence

Key quotes:
> "[[Canada]] is not pursuing a free trade deal with Beijing but was seeking to reduce its economic reliance on the US."

Strategic context: US tariffs and trade tensions pushing [[Canada]] to diversify.

## Early deals post-thaw

| Deal | Value | Sector |
|------|-------|--------|
| EV tariff exemption | Up to 49,000 Chinese-built EVs/year exempt from 100% tariff | Auto |
| Chinese-Canadian EV JV | In negotiation — [[Magna]], [[Linamar]], [[Martinrea]] + Chinese OEMs | Auto |
| Canola trade barriers | TBD | [[Agriculture]] |
| [[Zijin-Allied Gold acquisition]] | C$5.5B | Mining |

The Zijin-Allied deal is the first major cross-border M&A since the thaw began.

### Canada-China EV joint venture (Feb 2026)

Industry Minister Mélanie Joly announced [[Canada]] is pursuing a Chinese-Canadian auto joint venture to build EVs for global export.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Canadian partners | [[Magna]], [[Linamar]], [[Martinrea]] |
| Chinese firms in talks | [[BYD]], [[Chery|Chery Automobile]] |
| EV tariff exemption | Up to 49,000 Chinese-built EVs/year |
| Software partner | [[BlackBerry]] QNX (Ottawa) |
| Model | Honda Civic analogy — affordably priced, built in Ontario |

Strategic logic:
- Canadian parts firms already have operations in China — JV leverages existing relationships
- [[Canada]] reducing US trade dependence after [[Trump II]] tariffs on Canadian autos
- [[GM]] layoffs at Canadian plants + [[Stellantis]] reneging on Toronto-area [[Jeep]] factory restart
- [[Hyundai]]/[[Kia]] also targeted — sell hundreds of thousands of cars in Canada but make none locally
- Quebec is the biggest [[Kia]] market in the world

Security concerns: Joly said software controls can address concerns over Chinese vehicle technology — QNX could replace Chinese software stacks.

Tariff credit system: Canada keeping retaliatory tariffs on US-built autos but implementing import credits — the more cars a company builds in Canada, the less it pays on imported US vehicles. Credits are tradeable. Current biggest beneficiaries: Honda and [[Toyota]] (three-quarters of Canadian auto production).

## Sectors to watch

| Sector | Opportunity | Risk |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Mining | Chinese investment in Canadian juniors | Security review |
| [[Agriculture]] | Canola, grain exports restored | [[Trade]] volatility |
| Energy | [[LNG]] to China | Climate politics |
| Tech | Limited — Huawei still restricted | Security concerns |
| EV/batteries | Chinese EV investment | US pressure |

## Constraints on thaw

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| US pressure | [[Canada]] can't stray too far from US policy |
| Security reviews | Investment [[Canada]] Act scrutiny on Chinese deals |
| Huawei [[5G]] ban | Still in place, irritant |
| Public opinion | Canadian sentiment on China still negative |
| [[Taiwan]] | [[Canada]] maintains unofficial ties |

## Comparison to peers

| Country | China stance (2026) |
|---------|---------------------|
| [[Canada]] | Thawing — Carney pivot |
| [[Australia]] | Thawed 2023 under Albanese |
| [[UK]] | Cool — limited engagement |
| US | Adversarial — tariffs, tech war |
| [[EU]] | "De-risking" — selective engagement |

[[Canada]] following [[Australia]]'s path: pragmatic re-engagement while maintaining security red lines.

## Investment implications

| [[Signal]] | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Chinese mining deals in [[Canada]] | Regulatory openness |
| [[Agriculture]] trade normalized | Tariff barriers dropping |
| Resource sector activity | China seeking supply security |
