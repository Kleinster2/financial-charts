**Buffett's Alpha** — landmark academic paper by Andrea Frazzini, David Kabiller, and Lasse Heje Pedersen (NBER Working Paper 19681, 2013; published in *Financial Analysts Journal*, 2018). Decomposes [[Warren Buffett]]'s track record into explainable, replicable factor exposures.

## Key findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Sharpe ratio | 0.76 — higher than any stock or mutual fund with 30+ year history |
| Raw alpha | Significant vs traditional risk factors (market, size, value) |
| Alpha after factor controls | **Insignificant** when controlling for Betting-Against-Beta and Quality-Minus-Junk |
| Leverage | ~1.6x average, sourced from insurance float at near-zero cost |
| Public vs private | Public stock picks outperformed wholly-owned subsidiaries |

The central conclusion: Buffett's returns are "neither luck nor magic" but reward for leveraging cheap, safe, high-quality stocks — factor premia he recognized decades before academia documented them.

## The factor decomposition

Buffett's portfolio systematically tilts toward:

- **Low-beta stocks** — less volatile than the market, historically underpriced relative to their risk-adjusted returns (the "Betting Against Beta" factor)
- **High-quality stocks** — profitable, stable, growing, high payout ratios, low price-to-book (the "Quality Minus Junk" factor)
- **Leverage** — insurance float provides capital at negative real rates, amplifying returns on inherently lower-volatility positions

A synthetic "Buffett-style" portfolio replicating these exposures performed comparably to [[Berkshire Hathaway]].

## Pre vs post 2000

| Period | Annual alpha vs R1000V | t-stat | Verdict |
|--------|----------------------|--------|---------|
| 1981–2002 | +16.8% | 3.13 | Statistically significant |
| 2003–2025 | ~0% or negative | <2.0 | Not significant |

Multiple explanations for the decline:

- **[[Regulation Fair Disclosure]]** — eliminated legal information advantages (Chamath's thesis)
- **Size** — at $900B+ market cap, generating alpha requires creating top-100-company-sized value annually
- **Factor crowding** — quality/value strategies became well-documented and widely implemented
- **Cash drag** — $347B+ cash pile earning below market returns
- **Sector mismatch** — underweight tech/AI, overweight insurance/utilities/manufacturing

The academic consensus leans toward structural explanations over the information-arbitrage narrative, though both likely contributed.

## Implications

1. **Factor investing works** — Buffett's returns are largely replicable through systematic strategies at much lower cost
2. **Leverage source matters** — insurance float is a structural advantage unavailable to most investors
3. **Early-mover advantage** — recognizing factor premia before they're widely known is itself a form of alpha that erodes as knowledge spreads
4. **Buffett's own advice aligns** — his advocacy for index funds reflects the mathematical reality that his edge was narrow and structural, not transferable
