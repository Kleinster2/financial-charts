## Key drugs and revenue

### Semaglutide ([[Novo Nordisk]])

GLP-1 receptor agonist. Single-target mechanism.

| Product | Indication | 2024 Revenue | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Ozempic | Type 2 diabetes (injectable) | ~$17.5B (DKK 120.3B) | +26% YoY |
| Wegovy | Obesity (injectable) | ~$8.4B (DKK 58.2B) | +86% YoY |
| Rybelsus | Type 2 diabetes (oral, 14mg) | ~$3.4B (DKK 23.3B) | +24% YoY |
| Wegovy pill | Obesity (oral, 25mg) | Launched Jan 2026 | FDA approved Dec 2025 |
| Victoza | Type 2 diabetes (liraglutide) | ~$795M (DKK 5.5B) | -37% YoY, going generic |
| Saxenda | Obesity (liraglutide) | ~$1.0B (DKK 6.9B) | -33% YoY |

Total semaglutide franchise (2024): ~$29.3B. H1 2025 semaglutide sales ~$16.4B, annualized ~$33B.

2025 full year: Novo total sales DKK 309B (~$45.9B), +10% CER. Wegovy DKK 79.1B (+41% YoY). Ozempic growth decelerating sharply to +1-3% YoY by Q4 2025.

2026 guidance: Novo guided -5% to -13% sales decline at CER -- first decline in years. Stock fell 18% on the announcement (Feb 3, 2026). Driven by US pricing pressure ([[Trump II|Trump administration]] MFN deals), international patent expiries, and competition from [[Eli Lilly]].

### Tirzepatide ([[Eli Lilly]])

Dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist. Activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors -- mechanistic advantage over semaglutide monotherapy.

| Product | Indication | 2024 Revenue | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Mounjaro | Type 2 diabetes | $11.5B | +100%+ YoY |
| Zepbound | Obesity | $4.9B | First full year on market |

Combined tirzepatide (2024): ~$16.4B. Also approved for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (first drug approved for sleep apnea).

Q3 2025: Mounjaro $6.5B (+109% YoY) + Zepbound $3.6B (+184% YoY) = $10.1B combined in a single quarter, surpassing [[Merck]]'s [[Keytruda]] ($8.1B) as world's best-selling drug.

2025 guidance (raised): Lilly total revenue $63.0-63.5B. Q4 2025 revenue was $19.3B (+43% YoY). While Novo guided declining sales, Lilly delivered blowout growth -- divergence accelerating.

Lilly total company 2024: ~$45B revenue (+32% YoY).

### Liraglutide (first-gen, [[Novo Nordisk]])

| Product | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Victoza | Going generic. Teva authorized generic launched Jun 2024. Hikma, Lupin, Meitheal also approved. Patent expired Nov 2024. |
| Saxenda | Patent expired Feb 2023. Declining rapidly as market shifts to semaglutide. |

Liraglutide's patent cliff is relevant because it set the precedent for the compounding loophole -- pharmacies producing generic liraglutide demonstrate the manufacturing is feasible for peptide GLP-1s.

## Next-gen pipeline

| Drug | Company | Mechanism | Status | Key data |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Orforglipron | [[Eli Lilly]] | Oral small-molecule GLP-1 | Filing end 2025, approval expected Q2 2026 | ~11% weight loss at 72 weeks; no food/water restrictions |
| CagriSema | [[Novo Nordisk]] | GLP-1 + amylin (cagrilintide + semaglutide) | Filed for FDA approval 2025 | ~22.7% weight loss at 68 weeks; FDA response expected 2026, launch ~2027 |
| Amycretin | [[Novo Nordisk]] | Dual GLP-1/amylin (single molecule) | Phase 2; Phase 3 launching early 2026 | 22% weight loss in 36 weeks; potential best-in-class |
| Survodutide | [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]/[[Zealand Pharma]] | Dual GLP-1/glucagon | Phase 3 | Also in Phase 3 for MASH; approval trajectory 2027-28 |
| Retatrutide | [[Eli Lilly]] | Triple agonist (GIP/GLP-1/glucagon) | Phase 3 (7 more readouts in 2026) | 28.7% weight loss (~71 lbs) in TRIUMPH-4; 18% discontinuation rate at high dose |
| Oral Wegovy | [[Novo Nordisk]] | Oral semaglutide 25mg | Launched Jan 2026 | 16.6% weight loss at 64 weeks; 170K+ patients in first 4 weeks |

Orforglipron is strategically critical -- as a small molecule (not a peptide), it is cheaper to manufacture and not subject to the same biosimilar/compounding dynamics as semaglutide. Received Commissioner's National Priority Voucher for obesity.

Retatrutide could be the most potent obesity drug ever if tolerability improves. GlobalData forecasts $15.6B in sales by 2031.

Pipeline depth: IQVIA estimates 193+ assets in obesity development as of Oct 2025.

## The compounding loophole

### How it worked

Under Section 503A/503B of the FD&C Act, when an FDA-approved drug is on the drug shortage list, compounding pharmacies can legally produce copies. Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) was on the FDA shortage list from 2022 through February 2025 due to supply constraints. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) was on the shortage list until October 2024.

During shortages, thousands of compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies produced compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide at $100-300/month vs branded prices of $1,000-1,350/month. This created a multi-billion dollar gray market.

### Who exploited it

| Company | Approach | Scale |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Hims & Hers]] (HIMS) | Telehealth + owned compounding pharmacy | ~$725M weight loss revenue guided for 2025 |
| Ro (private) | Telehealth prescribing + pharmacy partnerships | Major DTC competitor |
| LifeMD (LFMD) | Telehealth + compounding | Q3 2025 revenue $60M total; weight management 50%+ of revenue |
| Noom | Weight management + compounded GLP-1s | Continued offering post-shortage |
| Mochi Health | Telehealth weight loss | Continued offering "personalized" versions |
| Thousands of local compounders | 503A/503B pharmacies | Estimated $3-5B+ market at peak |

### Timeline of enforcement

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2022 | FDA places semaglutide on drug shortage list |
| Oct 2024 | FDA resolves tirzepatide shortage |
| Feb 21, 2025 | FDA resolves semaglutide shortage -- HIMS drops ~41% |
| Apr 22, 2025 | 503A pharmacies must stop compounding semaglutide copies |
| May 22, 2025 | 503B outsourcing facilities must stop |
| May 2025 | Companies pivot to "personalized" dosing loophole (different dose + added ingredients = not "essentially a copy") |
| Jun 2025 | [[Novo Nordisk]] terminates partnership with [[Hims & Hers]], accuses them of deceptive marketing. HIMS drops 34% |
| Aug 2025 | Novo sues 12 compounding pharmacies directly |
| Sep 2025 | FDA sends 50+ warning letters to GLP-1 compounders |
| Feb 5, 2026 | [[Hims & Hers]] launches $49/month compounded oral semaglutide pill |
| Feb 6, 2026 | FDA announces restrictions on compounded GLP-1 ingredients; HHS refers Hims to DOJ for potential federal drug law violations. HIMS drops ~16% |
| Feb 8, 2026 | Hims halts oral semaglutide offering after "constructive conversations" with regulators |

Current status (Feb 2026): The compounding loophole is closing rapidly. FDA Commissioner Martin Makary stated the agency will use "all enforcement tools -- including seizures and injunctions." The DOJ referral of [[Hims & Hers]] signals zero tolerance. However, litigation continues -- the Outsourcing Facilities Association has sued the FDA over the shortage resolution determination.

## Insurance and pricing dynamics

### List prices vs reality

| Product | List price/month | With commercial insurance | Cash/self-pay | TrumpRx price |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Wegovy (injection) | $1,349 | $0-25 copay (90% of patients) | $199-349 (NovoCare) | $350 |
| Wegovy pill | -- | $25 copay | $149-299 | $150 (committed) |
| Ozempic | ~$935 | Varies by plan | $199-499 (NovoCare) | $350 |
| Zepbound (pen) | $1,086 | $25 copay (covered) / $499 (uncovered) | $299-449 (LillyDirect vials) | $346 |
| Mounjaro | $1,023 | Varies | -- | $245 (Medicare) |
| Compounded semaglutide | -- | N/A | $100-300 | N/A (being eliminated) |

### White House pricing agreement (Nov 2025)

The [[Trump II|Trump administration]] brokered deals with both [[Novo Nordisk]] and [[Eli Lilly]]:

- Medicare/Medicaid price: $245/month for Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, Mounjaro
- Medicare copay: $50/month (via demonstration project, starting Apr 2026)
- DTC pricing: Average $350/month, with commitment to reduce to ~$250 within two years
- Oral GLP-1s: $150/month initial pricing from either manufacturer on TrumpRx platform
- Direct-to-employer: Both companies now allow employers to bypass PBMs and purchase directly at fixed prices (via Waltz Health partnership)

### Insurance coverage landscape (shifting)

| Channel | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Commercial (employer) | 43% of firms with 5,000+ workers cover for obesity (up from 28% in 2024); many adding/removing riders |
| CVS Caremark | Dropped Zepbound, made Wegovy preferred obesity GLP-1 (Jul 2025) |
| Medicaid | Only 13 states cover GLP-1s for obesity (down from 16 in late 2025) |
| Medicare | Coverage for obesity + qualifying comorbidity only, starting Apr 2026 |
| Uninsured/self-pay | Growing segment; NovoCare, LillyDirect, TrumpRx expanding access |

Affordability gap: 54% of GLP-1 users report struggling to afford medication. The $200-350/month self-pay tier is the new competitive battlefield.

## Patent and generic timeline

### Semaglutide

| Jurisdiction | Patent status | Generic entry |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| US | Core compound patent expires Dec 5, 2031; 29 total listed patents, some to 2033 | ~2032 practical entry; 13+ companies have expressed interest to FDA |
| [[Canada]] | Expired Jan 4, 2026 | Generics expected Q3 2026 |
| [[China]] | Expiring 2026 | 10+ companies filed |
| [[India]] | Expiring 2026 | [[Dr Reddy's]] targeting 87 markets |
| [[Brazil]] | Expiring soon | Major market |

Patent thicket: Novo holds 320 US patent applications, 154 granted patents across Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus. The core compound patent (US 8,129,343) was extended to Dec 2031 via patent term extension.

Settled litigation: Mylan, [[Dr Reddy's]], Apotex, Sun Pharma all settled with Novo in fall 2024 -- terms confidential. Viatris won a major legal victory in Jul 2025 that could accelerate biosimilar entry.

Critical distinction: Semaglutide is a biologic peptide, so competitors must file biosimilars (not generics). More expensive to develop and manufacture than small-molecule generics.

1/3 of adults with obesity live in countries where semaglutide patents expire in 2026 (IQVIA). Generic price in [[India]] expected at $15-40/month.

### Tirzepatide

[[Eli Lilly]]'s tirzepatide has ~decade of patent life remaining -- significantly insulated from the generic threat hitting Novo in 2026.

---

## Regulatory landscape

### Federal (FDA)

- Feb 2025: Shortage resolutions trigger wind-down of compounding safe harbor
- Sep 2025: 50+ warning letters to compounders
- Feb 2026: FDA restricts compounded GLP-1 ingredients; Commissioner Makary says FDA "cannot verify quality, safety, or efficacy" of compounded versions
- New FDA guidance (2025) aims to cut biosimilar development time/cost in half
- [[Novo Nordisk]] accepted IRA Maximum Fair Price for Medicare Part D (effective Jan 2027)

### State-level actions

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| [[California]] | Board of Pharmacy adopted strict "essentially a copy" rules (Jun 2025) -- requires "clinically significant difference" for compounding |
| [[Florida]] | SB 860: Weight-loss-specific compounding restrictions + API documentation requirements |
| [[Indiana]] | Narrowed bill to follow federal guidelines + state reporting system |
| Massachusetts | S1497 (Jan 2026): Compounding under "patient safety" umbrella with board enforcement |
| Alabama, Connecticut | State AGs pursuing enforcement against compounders and raw API distributors |

### FTC

FTC issued notice to [[Novo Nordisk]] in Apr 2024 identifying improper listing of 17 device patents on the FDA Orange Book -- potential antitrust violations that delay generic competition.

## The GLP-1 economy: second-order effects

### Losers

| Sector | Impact | Data |
|--------|--------|------|
| Snack food | Spending on savory snacks down ~10% among GLP-1 households | Grocery spending down 5.3% overall; fast food down 8% |
| Alcohol | ~75% drop in alcohol consumption among GLP-1 users ([[Morgan Stanley]]); 24% stop drinking entirely | 44% of users drink less; wine -52%, beer -43%, spirits -40% |
| Bariatric surgery | Volumes declining as patients choose drugs over surgery | Some programs shutting down (e.g., Norman Regional Hospital, OK, 2024) |
| Fast food/QSR | 8% spending decline at limited-service restaurants | Higher-income households see steeper 8%+ drops |

### Winners

| Sector | Impact | Data |
|--------|--------|------|
| Pharma (NVO, LLY) | Obvious direct beneficiaries | Combined ~$45B in GLP-1 revenue (2024) |
| High-protein food | Yogurt, protein bars, meal replacements surging | Protein/meal replacement liquids +11% to $4.7B |
| Electrolyte drinks | GLP-1 users drink fewer fluids, need rapid hydration | Category beneficiary |
| Low/no alcohol | Projected 13.6% CAGR 2024-29 in US | vs 2.1% for traditional alcohol |
| Telehealth | Weight management drives platform adoption | Despite compounding risk, category growing |

### Paradox: sleep apnea ([[ResMed]])

- GLP-1 drugs reduce obesity-driven sleep apnea (Zepbound FDA-approved for OSA)
- But GLP-1 patients are 11% more likely to initiate CPAP therapy (more health-aware)
- Short-term tailwind (more diagnoses), long-term headwind (fewer obese patients)
- [[ResMed]] reporting +10% revenue growth, analysts rate Buy

### Food industry adaptation

- [[Nestlé]] launched first new brand in 30 years targeting GLP-1 consumers
- Conagra labeling Healthy Choice meals "GLP-1 friendly" -- outselling rivals
- [[Danone]] seeing double-digit growth in high-protein offerings
- By 2030, GLP-1 households projected to represent 35% of all food/beverage units sold
