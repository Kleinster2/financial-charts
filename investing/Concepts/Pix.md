## Why it matters for fintechs

**Before Pix (pre-2020):**
- Wire transfers (TED/DOC) were slow and expensive
- Fintechs like [[PicPay]] built businesses on faster P2P payments
- Digital wallets had competitive advantage

**After Pix (2020+):**
- Central bank mandated all banks offer Pix
- Commoditized instant payments
- Digital wallets lost their core differentiator
- Fintechs pivoted to credit, lending, banking services

> [[PicPay]] went from digital wallet to credit-focused bank after Pix eliminated its payments moat.
