**Treasury safe asset erosion** — The structural degradation of US Treasuries' status as the world's risk-free asset. The "convenience yield" foreigners paid for the safety and liquidity of Treasuries has collapsed, flight-to-safety mechanics have broken, and stock-bond correlations have turned positive. This is the modern Triffin dilemma: to supply the world with enough safe assets, the US has stretched itself financially until the assets are no longer safe.

## The arrangement

Post-Bretton Woods, the US became the world's sole banker supplying dollar-denominated safe assets to the rest of the world (RoW).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RoW holdings of safe US assets | **>$21T** (Treasuries, agencies, corporates, MMFs, deposits) |
| US net foreign asset position | **-$21T** |
| RoW share of Treasury holdings | **Largest holder** (bigger than Fed, bigger than all mutual/MMFs) |
| Japan alone | $1.2T in Treasuries |
| Federal debt held by public | 40% GDP (pre-GFC) → **100%+** now → **120%+ by 2035** (CBO) |

## How it used to work

**The virtuous cycle:**
1. RoW runs current account surpluses (exports cars, toys to US)
2. Recycles surplus dollars into US Treasuries at a premium
3. US government borrows cheaply ("exorbitant privilege")
4. In crises, foreigners *increase* Treasury holdings (flight to safety) → yields fall

**GFC proof:** When Lehman failed (Sep 2008), foreign investors ran *toward* the fire — bought Treasuries even though the crisis was US-made. Dollar appreciated, yields fell, convenience yield spiked to **>100bps** at the short end.

This "exorbitant privilege" created **fiscal exuberance**. Blanchard's 2019 AEA Presidential Address argued the US could always grow out of debt (r < g). DC used the extra fiscal space to run deficits for two decades.

## What's breaking

### 1. Treasury basis has turned negative

The **Treasury basis** measures the yield difference between actual Treasuries and "synthetic Treasuries" (e.g., German bund swapped into dollars). Historically positive — foreigners paid a premium for real Treasuries.

![[usd-treasury-basis-by-tenor.jpg]]
*Treasury basis by tenor (1997-2024). 1Y basis (blue) spiked during GFC but has since declined. 5Y and 10Y basis (gray) have gone negative — Treasuries now trade at a discount to synthetic alternatives. Source: Jiang, Richmond, Zhang (SSRN, Nov 2024).*

**At 5Y and 10Y, Treasuries now trade at a discount to G-10 peers.** The convenience yield that foreigners paid for safety has evaporated. The US can no longer sell "expensive bonds" — the seigniorage revenue on outstanding safe assets is gone.

### 2. Flight-to-safety mechanism is broken

| Crisis | Expected response | Actual response |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| GFC (2008) | Buy Treasuries, $ up, yields down | ✅ Exactly that |
| COVID (Mar 2020) | Buy Treasuries, $ up, yields down | ❌ **Foreigners SOLD Treasuries** → 10Y spiked 60bps in days |
| Tariff shock (Apr 2025) | Buy Treasuries, $ up, yields down | ❌ **VIX up, dollar DOWN, Treasury yields UP vs Bund** |

### 3. Stock-bond correlation turned positive

![[bond-stock-correlation.jpg]]
*Bond-stock correlation since the 1920s. Deeply negative from ~2000-2020 (Treasuries as hedge), then sharply positive post-pandemic. Treasuries no longer function as zero-beta hedges. This is a regime change, not a blip.*

The negative stock-bond correlation of 2000-2020 was historically *anomalous* — correlation was positive for most of the 20th century. But the 2000-2020 period is when the entire modern portfolio construction framework (60/40, risk parity) was built. That framework assumed Treasuries were safe havens.

### 4. Supply overwhelmed demand

Simple economics: demand for safe assets slopes downward. Federal debt went from 40% → 100%+ of GDP. You can't 2.5× the supply and maintain scarcity pricing.

## The Triffin dilemma, redux

Robert Triffin (1960): To keep the world supplied with enough dollars, the US must run persistent deficits, ultimately undermining confidence in the backing of those dollars. Triffin predicted Bretton Woods would collapse within a decade. He was right.

**This time:** To keep the world supplied with enough safe assets, the US must issue ever more Treasuries, ultimately undermining the "safety" of those Treasuries. The mechanism is the same — the supplier of the world's safe asset must debase that asset to meet demand.

> In 2008, investors questioned the safety of *private* safe asset substitutes (Lehman's MBS). This time, they're questioning the *Treasuries themselves*.

## Credit market echoes (Feb 2026)

The safe asset erosion is now propagating into credit markets.

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| IG spreads | Hit **multi-decade lows**, now widened ~8bps in last month to **82bps** (still below 10Y avg of 119bps) |
| Global spreads | Widened ~4bps in week of Feb 27 — largest move since Nov 2025 |
| Asian IG dollar notes | +2bps wider on Feb 27 alone |
| IG spread forecast | TD Securities expects **100-110bps**, up from 75-85 |
| Corporate issuance | UBS projects **$900B** new global corporate debt in 2026 |
| AI bond wave | **$400B+** from hyperscalers and DC builders flooding IG market |
| Fed warning | Jan FOMC minutes: "historically low credit spreads" flagged by several participants |
| Vanguard | Says investors are "full" on credit |

### The AI-private credit nexus

The specific fear: **AI disruption could spike private credit defaults to 15%** (UBS credit strategists, Feb 2026). Private credit is a key funding source for technology firms — especially software companies. Bain separately warns software default rates could hit double digits.

This creates a contagion channel:
1. AI disrupts software business models → leveraged software borrowers default
2. Private credit funds (key lenders) take losses → dividend cuts, redemptions ([[BlackRock|TCPC]] -32% dividend, **Blue Owl Capital** halting withdrawals, **[[KKR]]/Future Standard** BDC also cutting)
3. Sentiment spills into public credit → IG spreads widen
4. **Market Financial Solutions Ltd** (UK mortgage-finance) collapsed into insolvency this week — loose underwriting. Last year: First Brands Group (auto parts) and Tricolor Holdings (sub-prime auto lender) bankruptcies already unsettled Wall Street.

**CreditSights (Zerlina Zeng, Asia strategy):** "For now, we don't see severe contagion risk to public credits from the private market, given its relative size." But warns: watch for credit quality deterioration at smaller lenders and concentration risks in tech.

**Eastspring Investments (Clement Chong):** "Valuations in the Asian market have tightened in sync with developed markets like the US, and we will not be immune to volatility there."

### The doom loop

In the old regime, credit spreads widen → Treasuries rally (flight to safety) → portfolio hedged. In the new positive stock-bond correlation regime, a growth shock could hit equities, corporates, *and* Treasuries simultaneously. Credit spreads have almost no cushion (~82bps vs 119bps avg) for a world where the hedge doesn't work.

**Bridgewater positioning (Greg Jensen, Jan 2026):** Betting on the scenario where credit spreads widen and long-end Treasuries rally in flight-to-quality. This is a bet that the old regime still holds for extreme events. If it doesn't — and March 2020 and April 2025 suggest it might not — there's nowhere to hide except cash and gold.

The wall of AI-related issuance ($400B+) is particularly dangerous because it's hitting a market at multi-decade tight spreads with deteriorating Treasury safe-haven dynamics. If the AI capex cycle disappoints, this debt reprices violently with no Treasury offset.

## The smart money is already moving

**[[BlackRock]]** (Navin Saigal, Feb 26 2026): Publicly called it a "golden age" for JGBs. Dollar-hedged 20Y JGBs yield **6.06%** — 140bps *more* than comparable Treasuries. 30Y JGBs offer **+175bps** pickup. PIMCO echoing the same view.

When the world's largest asset manager goes on TV to tell you Japanese bonds are a better deal than Treasuries, the Treasury safe asset premium isn't just eroding — it's already gone at the long end.

## Investment implications

- **60/40 is structurally impaired** — positive stock-bond correlation means bonds don't hedge equity drawdowns
- **Term premium must rise** — Treasuries need to offer more yield to attract buyers who no longer get a "safety premium"
- **Dollar weakness** — if foreigners aren't fleeing to Treasuries in crises, the dollar loses its crisis-appreciation mechanism
- **Alternative safe assets** — gold, German bunds, Swiss francs benefit from relative safety reallocation
- **Fiscal discipline premium** — countries with credible fiscal paths (Switzerland, Singapore, Nordics) gain relative attractiveness
