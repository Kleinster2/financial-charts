## US Economic Outlook (2026)

### [[Goldman Sachs]] (David Mericle) — Jan 11, 2026

| Metric | Goldman | Consensus |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| GDP growth | **2.5%** Q4/Q4 (2.8% full-year) | 2.0% |
| Core PCE (Dec) | 2.1% | — |
| Core CPI | 2.0% | — |
| Unemployment | 4.5% (stable) | — |
| Fed cuts | **2x 25bp** (Jun, Sep) | — |

**Growth drivers:**
- Tax cuts (Trump package)
- Real wage gains
- Rising wealth
- [[Productivity]] growth (AI boost)
- Lower immigration → less labor supply

**Risks:**
- Jobless growth (AI replacing labor)
- Tariffs unlikely (midterm election pressure)

**"More will come from productivity growth, which has rebounded and should receive a boost from AI, and less from labor supply growth with immigration now much lower."**
