| Growth | Resilient, 2.5-3% global |
| Policy | Supportive (Fed cuts + fiscal stimulus) |
| Valuations | Elevated but "not yet egregious" |
| Recession | Low probability |

### Growth forecasts

**Global:**

*US bull case reasoning:*
- **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** — Tax cuts, fiscal stimulus, deregulation (BofA, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo)
- **AI capex** — 3x historical average contribution to growth (BlackRock); "AI-fueled recovery" (Apollo)
- **Fed cuts** — Rate-cutting cycle boosts housing, manufacturing, credit-sensitive sectors
- **Animal spirits** — Deregulation + business confidence (Federated Hermes)
- **Wealthy consumer** — Asset appreciation sustaining spending despite weak labor (Future Standard)

*US bear case reasoning:*
- **Labor market** — "Clear and present danger" if weakness becomes self-reinforcing (BCA)
- **K-shaped economy** — Divergence between AI winners and Main Street feeling tariff/immigration pinch (ABN AMRO, Tallbacken)
- **Stagflation risk** — Growth slowing + inflation stuck at 3% (Apollo)
- **Tariff drag** — First half softer from lingering stagflationary effects (Vanguard)

**Europe:**

| Source | Euro zone | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Robeco | **1.6%** | Most bullish (Germany fiscal) |
| Capital Group | 1.4% | |
| Goldman Sachs | 1.3% | Germany + Spain |
| UBS / Ned Davis | 1.1% | |
| UniCredit / Lombard | 1.0% | |

*Europe bull case reasoning:*
- **Germany fiscal bazooka** — €500B special fund for infrastructure, defense, climate (Deutsche Bank, Robeco, ABN AMRO)
- **ECB rate cuts** — Lagged impact boosting credit-sensitive sectors (Robeco, LGIM)
- **NGEU fund acceleration** — Massive EU distribution to periphery (SocGen)
- **Excess household savings** — 2% above 20-year average, room to spend (Robeco)
- **Defense spending** — Governments increasing military budgets across region (Janus Henderson)

*Europe bear case reasoning:*
- **France political uncertainty** — Tough decisions postponed to 2027 election (JPM AM)
- **UK fiscal tightening** — Tax rises weighing on near-term growth (JPM AM)
- **Manufacturing loss to China** — Structural competitiveness challenges (Morgan Stanley)
- **Tariff front-loading** — 2025 surge drained manufacturing demand (T. Rowe Price)

**China:**

| Source | China GDP | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Vanguard | **5.0%** | Above consensus |
| Goldman Sachs | 4.8% | Exports outweigh weak demand |
| Bank of America | 4.7% | Upside risks |
| Amundi | 4.4% | |
| UniCredit | 4.1% | Structural headwinds |
| Capital Economics | **~3%** | Most bearish (their proxy) |

*China bull case reasoning:*
- **Strong exports** — Trade surplus supports growth despite domestic weakness (Goldman)
- **Stimulus execution** — Delayed fiscal measures + front-loaded budget spending lift H1 (JPM)
- **Housing bottoming** — Deleveraging cycle reaching final phase (Robeco)
- **Tech-driven growth** — Leaning into AI, semiconductors (Principal)
- **Positive trade talk signs** — Risks skewed to upside (BofA)

*China bear case reasoning:*
- **Property sector stress** — Real estate drag continues (UniCredit, Lombard Odier)
- **Weak domestic demand** — Consumer confidence subdued (Goldman, UniCredit)
- **Structural headwinds** — Growth model transition incomplete (UniCredit)
- **Not a global growth driver** — "US consumer remains most important" (BCA)

**Recession probability:**

| Source | US recession odds |
|--------|-------------------|
| Robeco | 20% |
| JPMorgan | 35% |

### Inflation outlook

**Consensus: "Sticky slide" — worst behind us, but slow cooling**

**US inflation forecasts:**

| Source | Measure | Forecast |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Pictet | CPI | **3.3%** (rising from 2.9%) |
| Capital Economics | Core PCE | ~3% |
| Robeco | CPI | "Random walk around 3%" |
| Apollo | — | 3% |
| Capital Group | — | 3-3.3% |
| iCapital | Core PCE | Above 3% |
| Wells Fargo | Core PCE | 2.6% (Q4/Q4) |
| LPL | Core PCE | 2.5% by year-end |

*US inflation drivers (upside):*
- **Tariffs** — Goods price pass-through, especially H1 (JPM, Columbia Threadneedle)
- **Immigration crackdown** — Labor supply reduction, wage pressure (Lazard, ABN AMRO)
- **AI crowding out** — Capex absorbing resources, potentially inflationary (BlackRock)
- **Fiscal stimulus** — One Big Beautiful Bill adding demand (BNP Paribas)
- **Services sticky** — Shelter, healthcare slow to moderate (iCapital)

*US inflation drivers (downside):*
- **Oil glut** — "Massive supply glut" helpful offset (ABN AMRO, Bel Air)
- **Cooling labor market** — "No hiring, no firing" stasis (BlackRock)
- **Money supply restrained** — Cooling home prices/rents (Bel Air)
- **Tariff one-off** — If pass-through is transitory not persistent (JPM)
- **AI productivity** — Long-term disinflation force (Goldman, Morgan Stanley)

**Europe inflation:**

| Source | Forecast | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Robeco | ~2% | 100bps below US |
| Vanguard | ~2% | At target |
| ABN AMRO | <2% | Potential undershoot |
| BNP Paribas | <2% by 2027 | More cuts than priced |

Europe escapes US inflation pressures — no tariffs, no immigration crackdown.

**Central bank implications:**

| Central bank | Source | Rate forecast | vs Market |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Fed** | Capital Economics | 3.25-3.5% | Higher (mkt <3%) |
| **Fed** | Vanguard | ≥3.5% (neutral) | Higher |
| **Fed** | BNY | 2.5% by 2027 | — |
| **Fed** | LPL | 75-100bps cuts | — |
| **ECB** | Capital Economics | 1.5% | Lower (mkt ~2%) |
| **ECB** | BNP Paribas | More cuts | Lower |
| **BOE** | Capital Economics | 3% | Lower (mkt 3.5%) |

*Key divergence:* US-Europe inflation gap = US-Europe rate gap. Unusual divergence, relevant for FX and asset allocation (Apollo).

**Inflation risk skew:**

> "The risk for 2026 is that as activity gains momentum, workers start to feel more confident asking for higher pay and inflation does become a bigger issue. We are mindful that economists generally have a poor track record of forecasting inflation spikes." — **JPMorgan Asset Management**

Most see risks tilted to **higher** inflation, not lower.

### Monetary policy

**Consensus: "Easy does it" — easing continues, but less than market expects**

**Federal Reserve:**

| Source | Terminal rate | Cuts | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------|-------|
| Pictet | **3.75%** | 1 cut | Most hawkish |
| Capital Economics | 3.25-3.5% | — | Higher than market (<3%) |
| Vanguard | ≥3.5% | Limited | Neutral floor |
| UniCredit | 3.5% | 2 cuts | By year-end |
| Robeco | ~3.25% | 75bps | Above consensus 3% |
| Wells Fargo | 3-3.25% | 2 cuts | By mid-year |
| Goldman Sachs | 3-3.25% | 50bps | Dovish risks (disinflation) |
| Capital Group | 3% | — | "Dovish central bank" |
| ABN AMRO | 3% | — | By September |
| LPL | — | 75-100bps | Gradual |
| BNY | **2.5%** | — | By 2027, most dovish |

*Fed bull case (more cuts):*
- **Labor market** — "No hiring, no firing" gives room to cut (BlackRock)
- **Disinflation conviction** — Tariffs fade, AI/China supply forces emerge (Goldman)
- **New Fed Chair** — May appointment likely more dovish (iCapital, SocGen, Carmignac)
- **Political pressure** — Trump "turbocharging" stimulus ahead of midterms (Carmignac)
- **Rate-sensitive sectors** — In "two-year recession," relief is "rocket booster" (Federated Hermes)

*Fed bear case (fewer cuts):*
- **Sticky inflation** — 3% PCE limits room to cut (Capital Economics, Vanguard)
- **Resilient economy** — Solid growth doesn't require stimulus (Capital Economics)
- **Independence risk** — Political appointments could undermine credibility (Columbia Threadneedle)
- **Inflation reignition** — Tail risk of wage-price spiral (Northern Trust)

**Fed Chair transition (May 2026):**

> "We don't know who will be the Fed Chairman, nor how dovish a post-Powell Fed will be. However, we think it's a reasonable assumption that an unusually high level of dissent among Fed officials will be a defining feature of next year's Fed." — **Tallbacken Capital**

> "Under intense political pressure, the Fed now seems likely to bring interest rates back to 'neutral' – a level which it believes to be around 3%." — **JPMorgan Asset Management**

**European Central Bank:**

| Source | Rate forecast | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Capital Economics | **1.5%** | Below market (~2%) |
| Amundi | 1.5% | By mid-2026 |
| BNP Paribas | More cuts | Than priced |
| Robeco | 1 cut (25bps) | — |
| Vanguard | On hold | — |
| Lombard Odier | On hold | At neutral |
| ABN AMRO | On hold | Risk tilted to cut |
| Capital Group | **Hike** | Outlier |
| Nuveen | **Hike** | By end 2026 |

Split consensus: Most see hold/cuts, but Capital Group and Nuveen see potential hikes.

**Bank of England:**

| Source | Rate forecast | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Capital Economics | **3%** | Below market (3.5%) |
| Amundi | 3.25% | — |
| Goldman Sachs | 75bps cuts | — |
| First Abu Dhabi | 3% | By end H1 |
| T. Rowe Price | More cuts | Than priced |
| LGIM | More cuts | Growth vulnerable |

UK consensus: More cuts than market expects due to fiscal tightening drag.

**Bank of Japan — the outlier:**

| Source | Forecast | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Capital Economics | **1.25%** | Hikes |
| JPMorgan | 50bps hikes | — |
| Robeco | Underpriced hike risk | — |
| Nuveen | Hike | By end 2026 |
| T. Rowe Price | More hikes | Than expected |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Hikes | Inflation + growth |

**BOJ reasoning:**
- Tight labor market + fiscal support (Capital Economics)
- Domestic inflation pressures (Lazard, T. Rowe)
- New PM Takaichi's fiscal expansion adds inflation (Lazard)
- Divergence from other DM central banks = volatility risk (Lazard)

**PBOC (China):**
- Further easing to support activity (UniCredit)
- But reluctant to cut aggressively (T. Rowe Price)
- Weaker yuan reduces urgency for cuts (Robeco)

**Key theme: Market mispricing**

Most firms think markets price too many cuts:
- Fed: Market <3%, consensus 3-3.5%
- ECB: Market ~2%, consensus 1.5-2%
- BOE: Market 3.5%, consensus 3%

### Fiscal policy

**Consensus: "Big spenders" — sustainability concerns, but spending continues**

Political pressures prevent fiscal consolidation. Bond investors remain on guard.

**US fiscal outlook:**

| Policy | Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** | BofA, Wells Fargo, NatWest, Principal | Near-term stimulus, tax cuts |
| Trump stimulus | Carmignac | "Turbocharging" ahead of midterms |
| Govt job cuts | Allspring | Partial offset to loose fiscal |
| Tariff revenue risk | Barclays Private Bank | $300B/year may be ruled illegal by Supreme Court |

*US fiscal risks:*
- **Sustainability** — Deficits widening, interest costs rising (Macquarie, Schroders)
- **Bond market vigilance** — Could be catalyst for correction (Schroders)
- **Fiscal dominance** — Source of expected turbulence (BNY)
- **K-shaped recovery** — Fiscal benefits uneven (BNY)

**Europe fiscal outlook:**

| Country | Source | View |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Germany** | Goldman, JPM AM, Lazard, Allspring | "Fiscal bazooka" firing, ambitious infrastructure plans |
| **France** | JPM AM | Tough decisions postponed to 2027 election |
| **Italy** | UniCredit | Benefits from EU recovery funds |
| **Euro zone** | BNP Paribas | Most bullish — fiscal stimulus drives stronger growth |

> "Our most pronounced non-consensus view is on the euro zone, where we expect fiscal stimulus to drive stronger growth than many other forecasters do." — **BNP Paribas**

NGEU fund rollout + Germany fiscal expansion = US-Europe growth convergence (Capital Group).

**Japan fiscal outlook:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Invesco | Meaningful fiscal stimulus supports above-trend growth |
| JPM AM | Enormous 2025 fiscal stimulus feeds through in 2026 |
| Lazard | PM Takaichi pursuing expansionary Abenomics-style agenda |
| T. Rowe Price | More fiscal stimulus adds fuel to inflation → BOJ hikes more |

Japan fiscal + BOJ tightening = new tension (Lazard).

**China fiscal outlook:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Allspring | Should provide more stimulus to cushion export slowdown |
| Lazard | Limited fiscal stimulus expected; housing crisis continues |
| T. Rowe Price | PBOC reluctant to ease, prefers quantity-based credit tools |

China fiscal response viewed as insufficient by most.

**UK fiscal outlook:**
- Potential for term premia spikes around fiscal events (NatWest)
- Political uncertainty increasing (NatWest)

**Key fiscal theme: Bond market as enforcer**

> "As interest costs rise and issuance increases, fiscal choices will directly influence bond markets, currency dynamics and risk sentiment, making fiscal trajectories as important as central bank policy for investors in 2026." — **Macquarie**

> "Political shocks that cast doubt over a government's commitment to fiscal discipline can provoke a sell-off in bond markets and a tightening in financial conditions." — **Capital Economics**

**Fiscal-AI intersection:**

> "The intersection of 'fiscal-plus-AI' could become a structural accelerator, supporting growth in infrastructure, energy and metals." — **BNY**

### Tariffs

**Consensus: "New normal" — barriers here to stay, but world has adjusted**

No repeat of Liberation Day. Supreme Court may strike down tariffs, but administration would reimpose via other means. 2025 was peak for effective tariff rate.

**Tariff outlook spectrum:**

| Source | View | Stance |
|--------|------|--------|
| Wells Fargo | 2025 was peak; 2026 directionally less restrictive | Optimistic |
| Capital Group | More clarity on tariffs supports solid growth | Optimistic |
| Citi | Won't deal disruptive blow to growth/inflation | Optimistic |
| Wells Fargo Inv Inst | Less disruptive than previously anticipated | Optimistic |
| Macquarie | 9-18 month lag → biggest impact in H1 2026 | Cautious |
| BCA Research | Markets overestimate Supreme Court strike-down odds | Cautious |
| Lombard Odier | Impact felt strongly — slowing trade, denting profits | Cautious |

**Supreme Court risk:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Barclays Private Bank | $300B/year likely ruled illegal; fiscal must adjust |
| iCapital | Adds uncertainty but admin has other authorities |
| Capital Economics | Revenue dependence means barriers stay regardless |
| ABN AMRO | Even if illegal, Republican Congress enables alternatives |

> "Could the imminent US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs be a game changer for the outlook? We think not." — **ABN AMRO**

Consensus: Legal outcome matters less than political will. Tariffs persist either way.

**Inflation impact:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Lazard | Elevated tariffs lift US inflation through H1 2026 |
| iCapital | Pass-through risks keep core PCE above 3% |
| Ned Davis | US inflation stays above Fed target due to tariffs + immigration |
| Columbia Threadneedle | Could feed through to sustained inflationary pressure |
| Apollo | US elevated vs Europe (no trade frictions) — unusual divergence |

> "The consensus expects US inflation to remain elevated because of ongoing tariffs. Europe faces none of these trade frictions and therefore will likely see inflation and interest rates fall in 2026." — **Apollo**

**Timing:**

> "We estimate a nine to 18 month lag from announcement to the impact of tariff increases, suggesting the biggest economic impact from this year's tariff increases could materialize in the first half of 2026." — **Macquarie**

**Beneficiaries:**
- US steel, aluminum, copper producers with domestic sales (Global X)
- US infrastructure plays with compelling valuations (Global X)

### AI outlook

**Consensus: "No bubble, no problem" — huge capex supports multiple sectors; not ready to burst**

Wall Street overwhelmingly bullish on AI. Productivity gains expected to accelerate. Theme broadening beyond Mag7.

**Bubble debate:**

| Source | View | Stance |
|--------|------|--------|
| UniCredit | No bubble; Mag7 are mature, cash-rich, earnings-generating | No bubble |
| Robeco | "Buzzing instead of bursting" — capex funded by cashflows not debt | No bubble |
| JPMorgan Wealth | No bubble about to burst; biggest risk is NOT having exposure | No bubble |
| LGIM | Bubble concerns overblown | No bubble |
| NatWest | Unlike previous tech, today's leaders have strong earnings, cash reserves | No bubble |
| Bank of America | Analysis of past bubbles suggests tech still on solid ground | No bubble |
| Invesco | Parallels with previous bubbles don't fully hold up | No bubble |
| BNP Paribas AM | Not yet in bubble territory; monitoring risk factors | No bubble |
| Evercore ISI | 30% probability of bubble inflating → S&P 9,000 | Bubble risk |
| Vanguard | Heady expectations unlikely to be met; risks growing | Cautious |
| Pictet | "Terrific 20" valuations ran ahead without earnings — vulnerable | Cautious |
| Goldman Sachs | Valuations have run ahead; higher volatility likely | Cautious |

> "In our view, there is no AI bubble, but this does not mean that there are no risks. Comparisons with the dotcom bubble are misleading. The Mag 7 are not start-ups with exciting business ideas but no products to sell. They are mature, cash-rich and earnings-generating companies." — **UniCredit**

> "So far expected earnings growth of the hyperscalers has remained in lockstep with growth in their capital expenditures. We do not see signs of overcapacity yet. We are not 'partying like it's 1999'. For now, the US tech sector exhibits a buzzing instead of a bursting bubble." — **Robeco**

**Productivity inflection:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Federated Hermes | AI productivity gains should begin to accelerate |
| Morgan Stanley | Companies/economies to benefit from AI productivity gains |
| Russell Investments | Benefits to ramp up in 2026; "J-curve" pattern emerging |
| Janus Henderson | Health care seeing meaningful innovation from AI |
| Macquarie | 2026 = transition from experimentation to widespread implementation |
| NatWest | Adoption still early stages — substantial room for growth |

> "We expect the benefits of AI to economy-wide productivity and profitability to ramp up in 2026. Importantly, the productivity cycle from new technologies often mimics a 'J-curve' pattern of initial negative results followed by eventual long-term gains." — **Russell Investments**

**Broadening thesis — beyond Mag7:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Russell Investments | Infrastructure cycle expanding into broader corporate adoption |
| Charles Schwab | Market could reward AI adopters more than enablers |
| Charles Schwab | Cannibalization/leapfrogging; less focus on Mag7 |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Enterprise adoption broadening; small caps in defense, tech, consumer, health care |
| Janus Henderson | Handoff from enablers → enhancers (software) → end users |
| Wells Fargo | AI developing from concentrated phenomenon into broad-based growth catalyst |
| Amundi | Favor exposure beyond AI race into broadening theme |
| LGIM | Invest in wide range of companies driving adoption across sectors/geographies |

> "The defining force for equity markets continues to be the AI buildout, but its impact is changing. The early infrastructure cycle — led by hyperscalers and semiconductor firms — is now expanding into broader corporate adoption. Companies that apply AI to boost productivity and margins are emerging as the next beneficiaries." — **Russell Investments**

> "We believe the market could reward AI adopters more than AI enablers, with adopters positioned to benefit by locking in measurable gains in efficiency and innovation." — **Charles Schwab**

**AI-adjacent sectors:**

| Sector | Sources | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Utilities** | HSBC, Wells Fargo, Global X, Amundi | Power demand for data centers |
| **Industrials** | HSBC, Neuberger Berman, Wells Fargo | Infrastructure buildout |
| **Energy** | Global X, BNY, Amundi | Power supply critical |
| **Health care** | Neuberger Berman, Goldman Sachs AM, Janus Henderson | Early AI adoption benefits |
| **Financials** | Neuberger Berman, Citi | AI integration |
| **Metals/Materials** | BNY, Amundi | Physical constraints on buildout |
| **Defense** | HSBC, Goldman Sachs AM | Strategic autonomy + AI |

> "Exposure to mega-cap tech is important, but other players are critical to the buildout and adoption as well. For example, the AI and data-center buildout needs power, making utilities and energy providers critical." — **Global X**

**K-shaped / Dispersion coming:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Tallbacken | Economy becoming K-shaped; scale matters; large > small |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Dispersion emerging among large players |
| Neuberger Berman | AI driving increasingly disparate macro/micro outcomes |
| Future Standard | Choppier, less unified AI trade ahead |

> "While we expect neither boom nor bust next year, we do expect increasing divergence within the economy. As the economy becomes increasingly K-shaped, asset managers will have to recognize that the stock and credit markets will also become increasingly K-shaped." — **Tallbacken Capital**

**AI risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **ROIC uncertainty** | Tallbacken | "Oracle dark cloud" — if AI spend doesn't deliver ROIC, expect re-rate |
| **FCF pressure** | Future Standard, Tallbacken | Capex pressuring cash flow; FCF yields at record lows |
| **Debt funding** | Lazard, T. Rowe Price | Capex increasingly debt-funded; assets may become obsolete |
| **Concentration** | Apollo | S&P 500 = largely investing in AI; diversification eroded |
| **Valuation** | Comerica, Goldman, Vanguard | Elevated; warranting caution |
| **Power constraints** | BlackRock | Major chokepoints in power systems and land permitting |
| **Macro contagion** | Tallbacken | AI capex larger than most fiscal programs — micro risk is macro risk |

> "The key macro risk next year comes down to AI infrastructure: if the AI fixed asset boom is not able to provide a convincing Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), we expect a broader sell-off in equities and more speculative credit. We need to remind ourselves that the AI capex spend is dramatically larger than most governments' fiscal programs; the micro risk is now the macro risk." — **Tallbacken Capital**

> "AI-related capex is increasingly debt funded, with assets that may become obsolete in a relatively short period of time, raising the risk of overcapacity and delayed returns." — **Lazard**

**Vanguard dissent:**

> "The heady expectations of US technology stocks are unlikely to be met for at least two reasons. The first is the already-high earnings expectations and the second is the typical underestimation of creative destruction from new entrants into the sector which erodes aggregate profitability." — **Vanguard**

> "Our muted US stock return forecast of 4%–5% average returns over the next five-to-10 years is nearly single-handedly driven by our risk-return assessment of large-cap technology companies." — **Vanguard**

### Equities outlook

**Consensus: "High to higher" — gains continue but slower than 2023-2025; diversification recommended**

Policy + AI + capex = continued gains. But US starting from elevated valuations means returns won't match past three years. Broadening beyond Mag7 is key theme.

**S&P 500 targets:**

| Source | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Capital Economics | **8,000** | Most bullish |
| Evercore ISI | **7,750** | Base case (9,000 bubble / 5,000 bear) |
| Federated Hermes | **7,800** | Upgraded from 7,500; 8,600 two-year |
| Morgan Stanley | **7,800** | 14% gain; US outperforms global |
| UniCredit | **7,600** | AI-driven productivity gains |
| DWS | **7,500** | Earnings growth + AI |
| Tallbacken | **7,400** | Consolidation expected mid-winter |
| LPL | **7,300-7,400** | 60% probability; 23x $320 EPS |
| iCapital | **7,200-7,400** | Fair value with modest multiple compression |
| Bank of America | **7,100** | 14% EPS growth but only 4-5% price appreciation |

> "We think a reasonable two-year S&P target is close to 8,600, implying an annual gain north of 14%." — **Federated Hermes**

**Return expectations:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| UBS | Global equities +15% by end 2026 |
| Columbia Threadneedle | High single-digit to low double-digit |
| iCapital | Mid-to-high single-digit |
| Vanguard | **4-5%** average over 5-10 years (bearish outlier) |
| BofA | 4-5% price appreciation despite 14% EPS growth |

**Regional allocation:**

**US — still favored but diversify:**

| Source | US View |
|--------|---------|
| Morgan Stanley | Outperform global peers |
| Truist Wealth | Retain US bias; innovation superior |
| BlackRock | Overweight US equities |
| Wells Fargo | Home-country bias; US preferred |
| Nuveen | US large caps over small caps and other DM |
| Amundi | **Neutral** on US equities |
| DWS | Do not favor tech-heavy US over other regions |
| Brandywine | Significant underweight to US |

**Europe — attractive valuations, fiscal tailwinds:**

| Source | Europe View |
|--------|-------------|
| Goldman Sachs AM | Capex spending, reindustrialization; defense, energy, financials |
| Amundi | Positive on financials, industrials, defense, green transition, SMIDs |
| JPM AM | Selective: banks, fiscal beneficiaries, GRANOLAS |
| Barclays Private Bank | Attractive valuations; add on weakness |
| State Street | Utilities, defense spending in industrials |
| Neuberger Berman | Face pressure on falling earnings; prefer fixed income |
| Morgan Stanley | Tepid; losing ground to China in manufacturing |

> "We believe the next leg of a European rally will be more substantive, as the earnings growth that ultimately determines stock performance could reset to a higher trajectory than investors have come to expect." — **Janus Henderson**

**Japan — positive consensus:**

| Source | Japan View |
|--------|------------|
| BlackRock | Like Japanese equities; strong nominal growth + governance reforms |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Megatrends + governance + earnings growth justify optimism |
| T. Rowe Price | Attractive valuations, robust cash flow, improved governance |
| Lazard | Attractive with policy support for consumption and corporate returns |
| JPM Chase | "Sanaenomics" + corporate reforms to propel equities |
| Neuberger Berman | Continue benefiting from earnings, buybacks, reforms, valuations |
| SocGen | Increase equity holdings broadly except for Japan |

**Emerging Markets — broadly positive:**

| Source | EM View |
|--------|---------|
| Russell Investments | Preferred overweight; active management opportunity |
| Lazard | Particularly appealing; AI exposure at 40% below US valuations |
| Lombard Odier | Bright spot; outperformance to continue |
| Goldman Sachs AM | 40% forward P/E discount to US; expected to narrow |
| State Street | Constructive; AI growth + loose liquidity + weak USD |
| Franklin Templeton | Should lead the way in 2026 |
| Pictet | Above all, emerging markets to outperform |
| Fidelity | Select EM equities look attractive |
| Nuveen | Cautious given trade policy vulnerability |

**China — divided:**

| Source | China View |
|--------|------------|
| UBS | **Top global opportunity**; tech sector; 37% earnings growth |
| JPM AM | Modestly positive; bull market can continue at moderate pace |
| Robeco | Contrarian trade; subdued expectations |
| Citi | Overweight alongside US |
| Pimco | Attractive opportunities |
| T. Rowe Price | Tactical opportunity set |
| Morgan Stanley | Headwinds from slow reflation |

**UK — defensive play:**

| Source | UK View |
|--------|---------|
| Barclays Private Bank | Diversifier; widest valuation discount in two decades |
| Pictet | Inexpensive protection against stagflation; attractive dividend |
| SocGen | Large-cap equities supported by weaker pound |
| Citi | Underweight |

**Sector preferences:**

| Sector | Bulls | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Financials** | Citi, HSBC, JPM Wealth, Pictet, Capital Group, Comerica | Yield curve, deregulation, loan demand |

| iCapital | Rotations more defining feature than sustained broadening |
| Brandywine | Midterm year often underperformance |

### Fixed income outlook

**Consensus: "Steeper" — rate cuts constrain front end, fiscal props long end; income over capital gains**

Curve steepening expected. Most embrace bonds for income, though some worry about hedging ability. EM debt and munis favored.

**10-year Treasury forecasts:**

| HSBC | **5-7 years** | Reduced from longer; volatility risk |
| LPL | Belly (to 5 years) | Neutral duration appropriate |

### Credit outlook

**Consensus: "Selectivity" — constructive environment but pricey; spreads more likely to widen**

Limited stress, supportive fundamentals. But spreads at/near cycle tights. Use for income, be selective.

**Credit stance spectrum:**

| Source | View | Stance |
|--------|------|--------|
| BNP Paribas | Bullish credit; HY opportunities | Bullish |
| T. Rowe Price | HY attractive, lower-risk way to benefit from strong economy | Bullish |
| Morgan Stanley | HY to outperform IG (insulated from AI issuance) | HY bullish |
| Barclays Private Bank | BBB medium-term, BB attractive yields | Constructive |
| Goldman Sachs AM | Securitized, HY, EM credit opportunities | Selective |
| Pictet | Positive on IG; mixed on US HY (tight spreads) | Mixed |
| DWS | Neutral IG; cautious HY (spreads don't reflect risks) | Cautious |
| State Street | Prefer sovereigns over corporates given tight spreads | Cautious |
| Schroders | Avoid generic credit beta; insufficient spread premium | Cautious |
| BCA Research | Overweight govt bonds vs corporates | Bearish |
| Citi | Underweight IG even without systemic event | Bearish |
| Goldman Sachs | Risk-reward less appealing; releveraging + AI issuance | Cautious |

**Spread outlook — widening bias:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| JPM Chase | Spreads expected to widen; AI + M&A issuance |
| Morgan Stanley | Tech issuance spike = wider IG spreads |
| Goldman Sachs | Releveraging + AI boom = modest widening |
| Tallbacken | Parts of credit will widen (lower income demographics) |
| LPL | Spreads not providing sufficient compensation |
| Robeco | IG tight; HY unlikely to outperform equities |

> "Across global credit markets, focus is shifting from the macro to the micro, and spreads are expected to widen in 2026. Capex-related issuance across the AI and AI-adjacent ecosystems will take their toll on high-grade spreads." — **JPMorgan Chase**

> "The spread earned for taking additional credit risk over government bonds is now at historically low levels. With these very tight spread levels, having significant exposure here seems unwise currently." — **Schroders**

**Investment grade:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| JPM Wealth | Opportunity in 5-7 year; European credit over sovereigns |
| Pictet | Attractive valuations; strong balance sheets |
| Deutsche Bank | May be attractive depending on risk appetite |
| BNY | Stable spreads create opportunities |
| DWS | Neutral; record-low spreads unlikely to tighten |
| Brandywine | Valuations far from compelling; pockets of opportunity |

**High yield:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| T. Rowe Price | Attractive; credit quality highest in years |
| Morgan Stanley | Outperform IG; insulated from AI issuance spike |
| BNP Paribas | Key opportunities |
| Principal | Compelling; heavy issuance may test capacity |
| DWS | More cautious; tight spreads don't reflect risks |
| Pictet | Mixed; among tightest spreads in previous cycles |
| Robeco | Stretched but could compress further |

> "In the fixed income allocation, we view high yield bonds as an attractive, lower-risk way — relative to equities — to benefit from a strong economy. Overall credit quality in the asset class is the highest in years." — **T. Rowe Price**

**Securitized credit — favored:**

| Source | View |
|--------|------|
| Goldman Sachs AM | AAA CLO tranches; BBB valuations attractive |
| Russell | Rotate into securitized credit |

### Commodities outlook

**Consensus: "Metallic taste" — gold extending run, industrial metals benefit from AI buildout; not much love for crude**

Gold supported by central bank buying and safe-haven demand. Copper/aluminum favored for AI infrastructure. Oil subdued on supply concerns.

| DWS | Fairly valued at EUR/USD 1.15 | Neutral |
| Deutsche Bank | Stability maintained | Neutral |
| Capital Economics | **Better year vs EUR/GBP**; yen may strengthen | Contrarian |

### Multi-asset outlook

**Consensus: "Diversify" — high valuations call for spreading risk across sectors, regions, asset classes**

AI not a bubble (per most), but megacap valuations stretched. Time to diversify. Stay nimble.

| iCapital | Midterm year average: 5.7% with 17.5% drawdown |

### Risks outlook

**Consensus: "Policy, AI, Geopolitics" — policy mistakes, AI uncertainty, geopolitical shocks loom**

Central banks cutting into sticky inflation = overheating risk. AI capex without clear ROIC = fragility. Geopolitical tensions persist.

**Policy risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Cutting too far too fast** | Columbia Threadneedle | Could steepen yield curves if bond investors lose confidence |
| **Fed Chair transition** | Capital Economics | May 2026 change = source of risk |
| **Fed independence** | Lazard, Nuveen | Biggest US debt market risk; could undermine credibility |
| **Overheating** | Schroders, Neuberger Berman | Policy could become too stimulative |
| **Inflation reignition** | JPM AM, Northern Trust | Workers asking for higher pay; tariffs + immigration pressure |

> "We believe the risk of policy error – specifically, cutting rates too far too fast – is rising. Lowering short-term rates to ease financial strains could steepen yield curves sharply if bond investors lose confidence in inflation control." — **Columbia Threadneedle**

> "The risk for 2026 is that as activity gains momentum, workers start to feel more confident asking for higher pay and inflation does become a bigger issue. We are mindful that economists generally have a poor track record of forecasting inflation spikes." — **JPMorgan Asset Management**

**AI risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **ROIC uncertainty** | Tallbacken | Key macro risk — if AI can't deliver ROIC, broader selloff |
| **Leverage buildup** | BlackRock | AI builders leveraging up; front-loaded investment, back-loaded revenues |
| **Hard landing trigger** | Goldman Sachs AM | Broad unwind of AI investments = hard landing precursor |
| **Obsolescence risk** | Lazard | AI capex debt-funded; assets may become obsolete quickly |
| **Labor disruption** | Russell | Could disrupt labor markets, upend business models |
| **Demand slowdown** | Apollo | Would hit data centers, stocks, consumers, beyond |

> "The key macro risk next year comes down to AI infrastructure: if the AI fixed asset boom is not able to provide a convincing Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), we expect a broader sell-off in equities and more speculative credit. The AI capex spend is dramatically larger than most governments' fiscal programs; the micro risk is now the macro risk." — **Tallbacken Capital**

> "The AI builders are leveraging up – investment is front-loaded while revenues are back-loaded. Combined with already highly indebted governments, this is creating a more levered and fragile financial system vulnerable to shocks." — **BlackRock**

**Geopolitical risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **US-China rivalry** | Lombard Odier, UBS | Tense relations persist; could entrench further |
| **Fragmented world** | JPM Wealth | Geopolitical and currency volatility will increase |
| **New threats** | Nuveen | Geopolitical turmoil could escalate or new threats emerge |
| **Political shocks** | LGIM, Capital Economics | Can wrong-foot markets; cast doubt on fiscal discipline |

**Tariff/trade risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Tariff persistence** | Lombard Odier | Impact felt strongly; reimposed even if struck down |
| **Supreme Court ruling** | Nuveen, BNP Paribas | Could upset framework; uncertainty resurface |
| **Protectionism** | First Abu Dhabi | Intensifying protectionism could reduce growth |

**Fiscal/debt risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Bond market selloffs** | Capital Economics | Short sharp selloffs from fiscal worries likely |
| **System fragility** | BlackRock | More levered financial system vulnerable to shocks |
| **Private credit** | Capital Economics | Trouble more likely from lightly supervised shadows |
| **Sovereign debt** | Capital Group, Deutsche Bank | Mounting government debt cause for concern |

> "Short, sharp sell-offs triggered by fiscal worries – similar to those seen in France, the UK and the US this year – are likely to be repeated at points in 2026." — **Capital Economics**

> "If trouble is coming, it is more likely to emerge from the shadowy parts of the system, in particular private credit and related structures that have grown rapidly in size and importance in recent years, and yet remain lightly supervised." — **Capital Economics**

**Valuation risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Stretched levels** | Ned Davis, Schroders | Extreme valuations threaten bull market longevity |
| **Correction risk** | Schroders | As markets rise, major correction risk becomes more acute |
| **Exuberance** | Vanguard | Risks growing even if appears "rational" |

**Labor market risks:**

| Risk | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Fragile job market** | Goldman Sachs | Could spark recession fear |
| **Weakening** | Bel Air | Further weakening a key risk |
| **Constrained supply** | Principal | Adds fragility to outlook |

**Recession probability:**

| Source | Probability |
|--------|-------------|
| Apollo | ~30% (implied by pricing) |
| Comerica | Elevated but <30% |
| Robeco | 20% |
| JPMorgan | 35% |

**BNP Paribas three key risks:**
1. AI-driven equity market correction
2. Inflation resurgence (excess US stimulus, geopolitical energy shocks, EM dynamics)
3. Renewed trade policy uncertainty (Supreme Court ruling)

**UBS four risks that could bring markets back to earth:**
1. Disappointment in AI progress or adoption
2. Resurgence or persistence of inflation
3. More entrenched US-China strategic rivalry
4. Re-emergence of sovereign or private sector debt concerns

**Hedges recommended:**

| Source | Hedge |
|--------|-------|
| Goldman Sachs | Shorter-term US rates for recession/AI reversal |
| JPM Wealth | Gold and energy commodities for geopolitical/currency volatility |
| UBS | Quality bonds and gold for stability |
| Invesco | Rebalancing portfolios to navigate growing risks |
