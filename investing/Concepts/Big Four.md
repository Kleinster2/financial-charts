## Origins

All four trace roots to 19th century British accounting firms, consolidated through mergers in the 1980s-1990s:

- **Deloitte** — 1845 (William Welch Deloitte, London)
- **PwC** — 1849/1998 (Price Waterhouse + Coopers & Lybrand)
- **EY** — 1849/1989 (Ernst & Whinney + Arthur Young)
- **KPMG** — 1870/1987 (Peat Marwick + KMG)

Became "Big Four" after [[Arthur Andersen]] collapsed in 2002 following the [[Enron]] scandal (was "Big Five" before).

## Service lines

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Audit/Assurance** | Financial statement audits, compliance |
| **Tax** | Tax planning, compliance, controversy |
| **Advisory/Consulting** | Strategy, M&A, technology, risk |
| **Legal** | Growing in some jurisdictions (esp. PwC) |

## AI and transformation

Collective AI investment: **$9B+** (2024-2026)

| Firm | AI commitment |
|------|---------------|
| Deloitte | $3B |
| KPMG | $4.2B |
| EY | $1.4B |
| PwC | $1B |

Graduate hiring down 44% YoY (2024) as automation reduces need for entry-level staff. Former PwC partner forecasts 50% of audit/tax/advisory jobs automated within 3-5 years.

## Regulatory issues

All four have faced significant audit failures and regulatory actions:

| Firm | Major scandal | Consequences |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| EY | [[Wirecard]] (Germany) | 2-year audit ban in Germany |
| PwC | Australia tax leaks | CEO resignation, police raid, A$780M fine regime |
| PwC | [[Evergrande]] (China) | 6-month ban in China |
| KPMG | [[Carillion]] (UK) | £21M fine |
| KPMG | US regional banks | Congressional criticism |

PCAOB (2022) found ~40% of audits inspected had significant deficiencies — audit quality deteriorating across the industry.

---

## Structural issues

**Conflicts of interest:** Firms audit the same companies they provide lucrative advisory services to. Australia's post-PwC scandal inquiry recommended mandatory operational separation of audit and advisory.

**Oligopoly:** Four firms audit nearly all major public companies. Market too concentrated for effective competition or accountability.

**Partnership model:** Each country's firm is a separate legal entity, complicating accountability and allowing scandal containment strategies.
