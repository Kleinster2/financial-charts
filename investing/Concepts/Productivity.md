# Productivity

Labor productivity (output per hour) — key driver of non-inflationary growth. Current boom is real, but cause remains uncertain. AI is the "most obvious explanation" but unconfirmed.

## Current data (Q3 2025)

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Labor productivity | **+4.9%** annualized | Strongest since 2023 |
| Unit labor costs | -1.9% | 2nd consecutive decline |
| Unit labor costs (Q2) | -2.9% | Revised from +1% |

**Significance:** 2nd strongest reading in two decades (excluding recession rebounds).

## Historical productivity (2006-2025)

| Period | Reading | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Normal range | -5% to +5% | Volatile quarter-to-quarter |
| 2008-09 recession | +9% | Recession rebound |
| 2020 Covid | +20% | Extreme rebound |
| 2022 | Negative | Post-Covid normalization |
| 2023-2024 | +2-4% | Recovering |
| **Q3 2025** | **+4.9%** | Boom (non-recession) |

## What's causing it?

**Unknown.** The article says productivity gains are "shrouded in mystery" and "no one can say for sure what's behind the numbers."

AI is the "most obvious explanation" but correlation ≠ causation.

## AI adoption (Census Bureau survey)

| Period | % of firms using AI |
|--------|---------------------|
| Oct 2023 | ~3% |
| Early 2024 | ~5% |
| Mid-2025 | ~9% |
| **Late 2025** | **~18%** |

**Caveat:** Late 2025 jump partly reflects survey question change (from "production of goods/services" to "any business function").

**Trend:** 3x adoption since early 2024 — but doesn't prove AI is driving productivity.

## AI productivity research

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Marketing (Ju & Aral) | Human-AI teams **+73%** more productive than human-human |
| Software development | Developers using AI completed **+26%** more tasks |
| Taxi drivers | +7% for low-skilled, ~0% for high-skilled |

**Implication:** AI impact varies by industry, task type, and baseline skill level.

## Investment implications

### Bullish case
- Productivity growth = non-inflationary expansion
- Lower unit labor costs = margin expansion
- AI adoption accelerating (18% and rising)
- Supports "soft landing" narrative

### Bearish/cautionary case
- Goldman (Mericle): Risk of "jobless growth" as companies use AI to cut labor
- Uncertainty about neutral rate — higher productivity may raise it
- Consumer inflation expectations rising (3.42% vs 3.20%)

## Fed implications

| View | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **Dovish** (Miran) | Lower unit labor costs → 150bp more cuts to 2-2.25% |
| **Cautious** (Author) | Higher productivity may raise neutral rate → go slow |

**Current rate:** 3.5-3.75%

**Key uncertainty:** Does productivity boom lower inflation (via costs) or raise neutral rate (via capital demand)?
