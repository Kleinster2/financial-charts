**Aluminum** — World's most produced non-ferrous metal (~70M tonnes/year). Energy-intensive production makes it sensitive to power costs. China produces ~60% of global output but has capped capacity at 45M tonnes. Primary vehicle: AA (Alcoa equity) or DBB (base metals ETF with aluminum weighting).

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LME aluminum | **$3,296/t** (highest since April 2022) |
| 4-week change | +8.78% |
| 12-month change | +24.6% |
| Global production | ~70M tonnes/year |
| China share | ~60% (45M tonne cap) |
| Market balance | Deficit expected 2026-2027 |

## Price forecasts (2026-2027)

| Source | 2026 forecast |
|--------|---------------|
| [[ING]] | $2,900/t average |
| SMM Research | $2,700-2,800/t equilibrium |
| PricePedia | >$2,900/t by 2027 |
| [[Morgan Stanley]] | $3,250/t (Q2 2026) |
| BCA Research | Supports to fade as cyclical conditions weaken |

Current price ($3,296/t) already exceeds most forecasts — suggests speculative premium or structural reassessment underway.

## Supply dynamics

### China capacity cap

China set a **45M tonne primary aluminum capacity cap** — nearly reached in 2025 (45.02M tonnes produced). This fundamentally changes market dynamics:

- Pre-cap: China could always "fill the gap" when global demand surged
- Post-cap: Incremental supply must come from outside China
- Result: Supply less flexible than historically

**Policy tightening:** China strengthening ETS restrictions on aluminum — CO2 quota allocation tightened in 2026, first absolute emission limits in 2027.

### New capacity outside China

| Region | New capacity | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Indonesia | 1.4M tonnes | 2026 |
| Indonesia ramp-up | 500K tonnes | 2025 additions coming online |
| UAE (EGA recycling) | 170K tonnes | Q1 2026 |
| USA (EGA Oklahoma) | TBD | End of decade |

**Indonesia challenges:** High-carbon power dependence, slow alumina integration, infrastructure bottlenecks, policy uncertainty.

### Production disruptions

Recent disruptions at key smelters:
- Iceland
- Mozambique
- Australia (Rio Tinto force majeure)
- Alcoa Kwinana refinery closure

## Demand drivers

| Driver | Outlook |
|--------|---------|
| **Solar/renewables** | Strong growth |
| **EVs** | Growing (aluminum intensive for lightweighting) |
| **Construction** | Stable |
| **Packaging** | Mature |
| **Infrastructure** | Government spending support |

Demand continues rising from energy transition — solar, EVs, grid infrastructure.

## Energy = the gatekeeper

> "If there is one theme that captures the aluminium supply outlook into 2026, it is this: electricity is not just a cost anymore; it is the gatekeeper."

Aluminum smelting requires ~14 MWh per tonne — making electricity costs the dominant production factor. Energy availability and long-term power pricing determine competitiveness.

**Low-carbon premium:** "Green aluminum" (hydro-powered) commands premium pricing. CBA's "low-carbon" positioning was attractive to both Chinalco and EGA.

## Bauxite & alumina supply chain

Aluminum production: Bauxite → Alumina → Primary Aluminum

### Bauxite exporters

| Country | Position | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Guinea** | #1 exporter | 99.8M tonnes H1 2025 (+36% YoY); 80% of China imports |
| **Australia** | #1 producer | 100-105M tonnes/year; domestic refining |
| **Indonesia** | Growing | Export ban lifted; domestic smelter focus |
| **Sierra Leone** | Emerging | 5M tonnes 2025 → 7M tonnes 2026 |
| **Cameroon** | Emerging | Minim Martap: 6M tonnes by Q1 2026 |

### Alumina capacity additions (2025-2027)

Over **30M tonnes/year** new alumina capacity coming online in China, Indonesia, India. Market expected to remain in surplus (~0.8-1.0M tonnes excess in 2025).
