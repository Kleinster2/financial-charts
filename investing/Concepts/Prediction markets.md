**Prediction markets** — Platforms where participants trade contracts on future event outcomes. Prices aggregate dispersed information into probability estimates. Regulatory status contested: [[CFTC]] classifies as derivatives; states argue they're unlicensed gambling.

## Why it works

Prediction markets operationalize [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s insight that prices aggregate dispersed knowledge. Each trader brings private information — the market synthesizes it into a probability.

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Skin in the game** | Financial stakes force honest probability assessment |
| **Continuous updating** | Prices adjust as new information arrives |
| **Diverse perspectives** | Aggregates specialists, insiders, generalists |
| **No authority required** | Decentralized — no single expert needed |

The Iowa Electronic Markets (1988) demonstrated prediction markets outperform polls for elections. Corporate applications followed — [[Google]] used internal markets for product launch forecasting.

## Market structure

| Contract type | Example | Payout |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Binary** | "Will Fed cut rates in March?" | $1 if yes, $0 if no |
| **Scalar** | "What will unemployment be?" | Linear payout based on outcome |
| **Conditional** | "GDP growth if Trump wins" | Isolates causal effects |

Prices = implied probabilities. A contract trading at $0.65 implies 65% probability.

## US regulatory landscape

### Federal: CFTC jurisdiction

The [[CFTC]] regulates prediction markets as **event contracts** under the Commodity Exchange Act. [[Kalshi]] became the first federally licensed exchange in 2020, designated as a DCM (Designated Contract Market).

**Jan 2026 shift:** Chairman [[Michael Selig]] announced formal event contracts rulemaking:
- Withdrew Biden-era proposed ban on sports contracts
- Directed staff to draft new rules (February 2026)
- Language may preempt state laws
- Philosophy: "minimum effective dose of regulation"

### State: Gambling classification

States argue prediction markets on sports = unlicensed sports betting, regardless of federal classification.

| State | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Massachusetts** | Preliminary injunction (Jan 20, 2026) | First court to block Kalshi sports contracts |
| **Nevada** | Injunction dissolved (Nov 2025) | State can enforce gambling laws |
| **Ohio** | Cease-and-desist (Apr 2025) | Citing MA ruling |
| **New Jersey** | Cease-and-desist | Coordinating with Ohio |

**Core question:** Does a CFTC license provide nationwide permission, or can states use police powers to classify as gambling?

Likely headed to Supreme Court given circuit split.

## Key platforms

| Platform | Status | Valuation | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| [[Kalshi]] | CFTC-regulated (US) | $11B | First federally licensed; sports = 90% of volume |
| [[Polymarket]] | Offshore (crypto-based) | $9B | ICE investment; settled 2022 CFTC probe; US users technically prohibited |
| [[Crypto.com]] | CFTC-regulated (CDNA) | — | [[Truth Social]] partnership; sports focus |
| Robinhood | Sports contracts | — | Facing Ohio cease-and-desist |

## Economics

**Why prediction markets matter for investors:**

| Application | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Policy uncertainty** | Fed rate probabilities affect asset allocation |
| **Election hedging** | Tariff risk, regulatory change |
| **Earnings signals** | Some markets track company events |
| **Macro forecasting** | GDP, inflation expectations |

Prediction markets often lead traditional indicators — they incorporate information faster than polls or surveys.

## Historical context

- **1503:** Papal succession betting (documented)
- **1880s-1940s:** Wall Street election betting markets
- **1988:** Iowa Electronic Markets (academic)
- **2003:** DARPA Policy Analysis Market cancelled after political backlash
- **2014:** Augur (blockchain-based)
- **2020:** [[Polymarket]] founded; [[Kalshi]] gets CFTC license
- **2024:** 2024 election — Polymarket/Kalshi surge; Trump win validated markets vs polls

---

## 2024-2025: Breakout moment

The 2024 US election was prediction markets' public validation:

- [[Polymarket]] showed Trump leading when polls showed toss-up
- Final Polymarket: Trump 60-65% vs polling aggregates ~50%
- Trump won — markets were right, polls were wrong
- Polymarket volume: $3.7B on election alone

**Result:** Mainstream legitimacy, massive capital inflows, regulatory attention.

## Risks and critiques

| **Manipulation** | Wealthy actors can move thin markets |
| **Liquidity** | Obscure contracts have wide spreads |
| **Regulatory** | Federal vs state conflict unresolved |
| **Self-fulfilling** | Can markets influence outcomes they predict? |
