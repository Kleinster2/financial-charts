**Basis trade** — Hedge fund strategy exploiting price gaps between Treasury cash bonds and futures. Now ~$1.5T, up 75% from 2019. Systemic risk if unwinding forces dealer capacity limits.

---

## The trade

**Mechanics:**
- Buy Treasury cash bonds
- Sell Treasury futures (short)
- Profit from small price gap (basis)
- Highly leveraged (via repo financing)

**Leverage:** Up to **$50 borrowed for every $1 of capital** (50:1)

**Why basis exists:** Pension funds, insurers prefer futures (less cash upfront) → futures trade above cash bonds → hedge funds arbitrage the gap.

**Risk:** If cash bonds underperform futures (reverse of expected), positions blow up. Unwinding overwhelms dealer capacity.

## Size growth

| Period | Size | Change |
|--------|------|--------|
| 2019 peak | ~$860B | — |
| March 2020 | ~$500B | Blowup |
| Early 2023 | — | Trade "roared back" |
| Jan 2026 | **~$1.5T** | **+75% from 2019** |

**Morgan Stanley (Jan 2026):** Notional size has outpaced Treasury bond issuance growth.

**Why it returned (2023+):**
- Fed rate hikes pushed 10-year to ~5% (highest since 2007)
- Institutional investors piled into Treasury futures
- Treasury ramped up issuance for deficits → cash prices down
- Gap between futures and cash widened → more arbitrage opportunity

## Risk concentration (Morgan Stanley)

| Tenor | Risk level |
|-------|------------|
| **5-year futures** | Highest |
| Ultra-long | Second |
| 10-year | Third |

"Exposure in the belly of the yield curve increasing in recent years."

## 2020 blowup

**What happened:**
- COVID market stress
- Cash bonds underperformed futures (reverse of basis trade expectation)
- Hedge funds forced to unwind + margin calls on futures
- Foreign central banks dumping [[Treasuries]] to prop up currencies
- Dealers couldn't handle volume
- Fed had to intervene

**Fed response:**
- Bought trillions in bonds
- Emergency repo funding
- Kept markets functioning

**Scale then:** ~$500B — **one-third of current size**

## April 2025 episode

**Trump tariffs triggered Treasury selloff:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 30-year yield | Jumped above **5%** (2-year high) |
| 10-year weekly move | **Biggest surge since 2001** |

**Debate:** Did basis trade unwinding amplify selloff?

**Other factors cited:**
- Treasury-swap spread trade unwinding
- Foreign investor retreat
- General deleveraging

**Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary):** "Nothing systemic... uncomfortable but normal deleveraging."

Market stabilized by April 11, but yields remained elevated.

## Regulatory scrutiny

| Regulator | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Bank of England | Borrowing by small number of large hedge funds |
| BIS | Potential financial stability risk |
| SEC | Push trades into central clearinghouses |
| **Fed panel (Mar 2025)** | Advised emergency program for basis trade unwinding |

**Why hard to monitor:**
- Party-to-party transactions (no central clearinghouse)
- Hedge funds face less scrutiny than banks
- Opaque leverage levels

---

## When to watch

**Morgan Stanley:** Current activity "not unprecedented" but needs monitoring when:
- Funding is tight
- Market turmoil
- Repo stress
- Sudden deleveraging

**Eli Carter, Shaun Zhou (MS):** "Needs to be watched, particularly when funding is tight or during bouts of market turmoil."

---

## Investment implications

**Tail risk indicator:**
- Not a direct trade
- Signals leverage in Treasury market
- 2020 showed spillover to all assets
- Watch repo rates, dealer balance sheets

**If basis trade unwinds:**
- Treasury volatility spike
- Risk-off across assets
- Fed likely to intervene (as in 2020)
