## Why it took 25 years

| Blocker | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **French farmers** | Fear Brazilian beef competition |
| **Amazon deforestation** | Environmental concerns |
| **Protectionism** | Both sides protecting sensitive sectors |
| **Political cycles** | Changes in Mercosur governments |
| **EU fragmentation** | Unanimous approval needed |
| **Irish farmers** | Beef competition concerns |

## French opposition

France most vocal opponent:

| Concern | French argument |
|---------|-----------------|
| Beef imports | Undercuts French/EU farmers |
| Standards | Brazil doesn't meet EU environmental/health rules |
| Amazon | Deforestation contradicts EU climate goals |
| Sovereignty | Agricultural independence threatened |

**Macron position:** Opposed in 2019, grudgingly accepted 2024 with side agreements.

**Farmer protests:** Widespread in France, Poland, Ireland.

---

## Environmental provisions

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Paris Agreement | Binding commitment |
| Deforestation | Must combat (enforcement unclear) |
| Sustainable farming | Standards to be met |
| Monitoring | Joint committee |

**Critics say:** Provisions lack teeth. Brazil deforestation continues.

---

## Ratification path

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| EU Commission | Approved |
| EU Parliament | Vote pending |
| EU Council | Unanimous (27 states) or split? |
| National parliaments | If "mixed" agreement |
| Mercosur states | Must ratify |

**Complication:** If deemed "mixed agreement," all 27 national parliaments must approve. France, Austria, Poland could block.

**Von der Leyen strategy:** Push as EU-only competence to avoid national vetoes.

---

## Geopolitical context

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **China in LatAm** | EU countering China's influence |
| **Brazil-China trade** | Brazil's largest partner is China |
| **Trump tariffs** | Mercosur diversifying away from US |
| **Strategic autonomy** | EU securing supply chains |
| **Lula return** | Brazil more open to deal |

**Zero-sum framing:** If EU doesn't engage, China fills vacuum.
