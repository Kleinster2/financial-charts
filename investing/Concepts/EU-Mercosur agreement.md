## Why it took 25 years

| Blocker | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **French farmers** | Fear Brazilian beef competition |
| **[[Amazon]] deforestation** | Environmental concerns |
| **Protectionism** | Both sides protecting sensitive sectors |
| **Political cycles** | Changes in [[Mercosur]] governments |
| **[[EU]] fragmentation** | Unanimous approval needed |
| **Irish farmers** | Beef competition concerns |

---

## French opposition

France most vocal opponent:

| Concern | French argument |
|---------|-----------------|
| Beef imports | Undercuts French/[[EU]] farmers |
| Standards | Brazil doesn't meet [[EU]] environmental/health rules |
| [[Amazon]] | Deforestation contradicts [[EU]] climate goals |
| Sovereignty | Agricultural independence threatened |

**Macron position:** Opposed in 2019, France voted against in Council (Jan 2026). Poland also opposed.

**Farmer protests:** Escalated to thousands of tractors surrounding [[EU]] Parliament in Strasbourg (Jan 21, 2026), clashing with police. Widespread in France, Poland, Ireland throughout 2024-2026.

---

## Environmental provisions

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Paris Agreement | Binding commitment |
| Deforestation | Must combat (enforcement unclear) |
| Sustainable farming | Standards to be met |
| Monitoring | Joint committee |

**Critics say:** Provisions lack teeth. Brazil deforestation continues.

## Ratification path

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| [[EU]] Commission | ✅ Approved |
| [[EU]] Council | ✅ Authorized signature (Jan 9, 2026) |
| Signed | ✅ Asunción, Paraguay (Jan 17, 2026) |
| [[EU]] Parliament | Referred to CJEU (Jan 21, 2026, 334-324 vote) |
| CJEU ruling | Pending (~2 years typical) |
| Provisional application | Likely from March 2026 (per [[EU]] diplomat, Jan 22) |
| National parliaments | If "mixed" agreement |
| [[Mercosur]] states | Must ratify |

**The "split" controversy:** Commission split the deal into a Partnership Agreement and an Interim Trade Agreement (iTA). The iTA covers trade-only matters ([[EU]]-only competence), bypassing national parliaments. Parliament's CJEU referral challenges whether this split is lawful.

**Parliament vote (Jan 21):** 334-324 to refer to Court of Justice. Thousands of farmers drove tractors to Strasbourg, clashing with police outside Parliament. Close vote reflects deep division — Green, Left, and some EPP MEPs joined with opponents.

**Provisional application:** Despite the court referral, the [[EU]] can apply the deal provisionally. Parliament retains power to annul later. [[EU]] diplomat (Jan 22) indicated March 2026 target for provisional entry into force.

**Von der Leyen/Merz position:** Push ahead regardless. Merz at Davos (Jan 22): "We will not be stopped. The [[Mercosur]] deal is fair and balanced."

---

## Geopolitical context

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **[[China]] in LatAm** | [[EU]] countering [[China]]'s influence |
| **Brazil-[[China]] trade** | Brazil's largest partner is [[China]] |
| **Trump tariffs** | [[Mercosur]] diversifying away from US |
| **[[US-EU trade]] tensions** | [[Greenland]] dispute, tariff threats accelerate [[EU]] pivot |
| **Strategic autonomy** | [[EU]] securing supply chains |
| **Lula return** | Brazil more open to deal |

**Zero-sum framing:** If [[EU]] doesn't engage, [[China]] fills vacuum.
