## Why it took 25 years

| Blocker | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **French farmers** | Fear Brazilian beef competition |
| **Amazon deforestation** | Environmental concerns |
| **Protectionism** | Both sides protecting sensitive sectors |
| **Political cycles** | Changes in Mercosur governments |
| **EU fragmentation** | Unanimous approval needed |
| **Irish farmers** | Beef competition concerns |

---

## French opposition

France most vocal opponent:

| Concern | French argument |
|---------|-----------------|
| Beef imports | Undercuts French/EU farmers |
| Standards | Brazil doesn't meet EU environmental/health rules |
| Amazon | Deforestation contradicts EU climate goals |
| Sovereignty | Agricultural independence threatened |

**Macron position:** Opposed in 2019, grudgingly accepted 2024 with side agreements.

**Farmer protests:** Widespread in France, Poland, Ireland.

---

## Environmental provisions

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Paris Agreement | Binding commitment |
| Deforestation | Must combat (enforcement unclear) |
| Sustainable farming | Standards to be met |
| Monitoring | Joint committee |

**Critics say:** Provisions lack teeth. Brazil deforestation continues.

---

## Ratification path

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| EU Commission | Approved |
| EU Parliament | Vote pending |
| EU Council | Unanimous (27 states) or split? |
| National parliaments | If "mixed" agreement |
| Mercosur states | Must ratify |

**Complication:** If deemed "mixed agreement," all 27 national parliaments must approve. France, Austria, Poland could block.

**Von der Leyen strategy:** Push as EU-only competence to avoid national vetoes.

---

## Geopolitical context

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **China in LatAm** | EU countering China's influence |
| **Brazil-China trade** | Brazil's largest partner is China |
| **Trump tariffs** | Mercosur diversifying away from US |
| **Strategic autonomy** | EU securing supply chains |
| **Lula return** | Brazil more open to deal |

**Zero-sum framing:** If EU doesn't engage, China fills vacuum.

## Comparison to other agreements

### Size comparison

| Agreement | Parties | Population | Combined GDP | Year |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|------|
| **RCEP** | 15 (China, ASEAN, Japan, Korea, ANZ) | 2.2B | $26T | 2020 |
| **EU-Mercosur** | 31 (EU + 4) | 780M | $22T | 2024 |
| **USMCA** | 3 (US, Mexico, Canada) | 500M | $28T | 2020 |
| **CPTPP** | 11 (Pacific rim, no US/China) | 500M | $13T | 2018 |
| **EU-Japan** | 28 | 580M | $21T | 2019 |
| **EU-Canada (CETA)** | 28 | 550M | $20T | 2017 |

EU-Mercosur = largest by population after RCEP.

### Tariff elimination

| Agreement | Industrial | Agriculture | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | 91% | Quotas, sensitive | 10-15 years |
| **USMCA** | 99%+ | Mostly open | Immediate |
| **CPTPP** | 99% | 95%+ | 7-20 years |
| **RCEP** | 90% | 65% | 20 years |
| **EU-Japan** | 99% | 82% | 15 years |
| **CETA** | 98% | Quotas (beef) | 7 years |

EU-Mercosur's agricultural quotas mirror CETA's approach — protect EU farmers while granting limited access.

### Agricultural sensitivity

| Agreement | Beef access | Dairy | Key friction |
|-----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | 99,000t quota | Quota | French/Irish farmers |
| **CETA** | 65,000t quota | Quota | Similar to Mercosur |
| **USMCA** | Open | US access to Canada | Canadian dairy |
| **CPTPP** | Varies | Japan quotas | Japan protection |
| **EU-Japan** | 51,000t quota | Tariff cuts | Japan rice excluded |

### Services liberalization

| Agreement | Financial | Telecom | Digital | Mode 4 |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | Moderate | Limited | Basic | Limited |
| **USMCA** | Deep | Open | Strong | Limited |
| **CPTPP** | Strong | Strong | Strong | Moderate |
| **EU-Japan** | Strong | Strong | Strong | Moderate |
| **CETA** | Strong | Strong | Moderate | Moderate |

EU-Mercosur's services provisions are **less ambitious** than CPTPP or EU-Japan.

### Rules of origin

| Agreement | Autos | Complexity |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | 50-60% | Moderate |
| **USMCA** | 75% + wage rules | High (labor value) |
| **CPTPP** | 45-55% | Moderate |
| **RCEP** | 40% | Simple |
| **EU-Japan** | 55% | Moderate |

USMCA has strictest auto rules (75% content + $16/hr labor).

### Environmental/labor provisions

| Agreement | Environment | Labor | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | Paris binding | ILO standards | Weak (criticism) |
| **USMCA** | Moderate | Strong (Mexico) | Rapid response |
| **CPTPP** | Suspended (US provisions) | Suspended | Weak |
| **EU-Japan** | Paris binding | ILO | Dialogue |
| **CETA** | Paris binding | ILO | Dialogue |

EU-Mercosur's environmental provisions criticized as unenforceable vs deforestation reality.

### Ratification complexity

| Agreement | Process | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **EU-Mercosur** | EU + 27 national? + 4 Mercosur | Pending, uncertain |
| **CETA** | Mixed — some provisional | Provisional since 2017, Belgium blocking |
| **EU-Japan** | EU-only | Fully ratified |
| **USMCA** | 3 parties | Fully ratified |
| **CPTPP** | 11 parties | In force for 9 |

EU-Mercosur could face CETA's fate — years of provisional application with national holdouts.

### Key differences summary

| Dimension | EU-Mercosur vs peers |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Size** | Largest by population after RCEP |
| **Agriculture** | More restrictive quotas than CPTPP |
| **Services** | Less ambitious than EU-Japan or CPTPP |
| **Autos** | Long phase-out (15yr) vs USMCA immediate |
| **Environment** | Binding Paris but weak enforcement |
| **Ratification** | Most uncertain (France, mixed agreement) |
