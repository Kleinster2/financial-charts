**[[Cybersecurity]] consolidation** — the market is fragmenting into platform winners and point-solution losers. Bet on the consolidators.

---

## The dynamic

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 50+ point solutions per enterprise | 3-5 platform vendors |
| Best-of-breed buying | Platform buying |
| CISO as integrator | CISO as platform selector |
| Fragmented data | Unified security data lake |

---

## Why now

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **AI threat surface** | New attack vectors require integrated defense |
| **AI-powered security** | Needs consolidated data to train models |
| **Vendor fatigue** | Enterprises tired of managing dozens of tools |
| **Talent shortage** | Can't staff 50 different security consoles |
| **Budget pressure** | Consolidation = cost savings |

---

## The consolidators

| Company | Strategy | Key acquisitions |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| [[Palo Alto Networks]] | Aggressive M&A, platform play | CyberArk ($25B), Chronosphere, Protect AI, Koi |
| [[CrowdStrike]] | Organic + selective M&A | Bionic, Flow Security |
| [[Microsoft]] | Bundle with enterprise | Built-in to M365/Azure |
| [[Cisco]] | Network-centric security | Splunk ($28B) |

---

## What gets rolled up

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Identity/IAM | Consolidating (CyberArk → Palo Alto) |
| Endpoint/XDR | Consolidating |
| SIEM/observability | Consolidating (Splunk → Cisco) |
| Cloud security | Consolidating |
| Supply chain security | Early (Koi → Palo Alto) |
| AI security | Very early |

---

## Investment implications

**Long consolidators:**
- [[Palo Alto Networks]] — most aggressive acquirer
- [[CrowdStrike]] — endpoint leader expanding platform

**Short/avoid point solutions:**
- Single-product companies get acquired or marginalized
- Exception: category creators with defensible moats

**Watch for:**
- Next acquisition targets (who's subscale but valuable?)
- Integration execution (M&A is easy, integration is hard)
- Microsoft bundling pressure

## Risks to thesis

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Integration failures | Track post-acquisition retention |
| Overpaying for targets | Watch multiples vs. growth |
| Microsoft wins everything | Enterprise resistance to single vendor |
| New category emerges | Consolidators acquire it |
