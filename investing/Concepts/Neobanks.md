# Neobanks

**Digital-first banks with no physical branches.** 500M+ users globally. Disrupted traditional banking with lower costs, better UX, instant onboarding. Winners emerging: [[Nubank]] (LatAm), [[Revolut]] (Europe/global), Chime (US). Most still unprofitable — credit expansion is the path to unit economics.

## Brazil neobanks

Brazil has the world's most developed neobank ecosystem. See [[Brazil fintech]] for full analysis.

| Company | Customers | Valuation | Differentiator |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| [[Nubank]] | 100M+ | ~$60B | Scale, LatAm expansion |
| [[Inter]] | 30M+ | ~$3B | Super-app model |
| [[C6 Bank]] | 30M+ | ~$11B | [[JPMorgan Chase]] backing |
| [[BTG Pactual]] digital | Growing | — | Investment bank going retail |

**Why Brazil leads:**
- [[Pix]] instant payments (87% adoption)
- Progressive central bank regulation
- Large unbanked population
- High traditional bank fees created opportunity

## US neobanks

US market is harder — regulatory complexity, entrenched incumbents, no instant payments until recently.

| Company | Users | Model | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| Chime | 20M+ | Free checking, early paycheck | Private |
| [[SoFi]] | 9M+ | Super-app (loans + banking + invest) | Public |
| Current | 4M+ | Teen/family banking | Private |
| Varo | 7M+ | First neobank with national charter | Private |
| Dave | 10M+ | Overdraft avoidance | Public |

**US challenges:**
- State-by-state banking licenses
- Partner bank dependency (most aren't "real" banks)
- No equivalent to Pix/Faster Payments
- Credit card rewards culture

---

## European neobanks

Strong ecosystem driven by open banking regulation (PSD2).

| Company | Users | HQ | Differentiator |
|---------|-------|-----|----------------|
| [[Revolut]] | 50M+ | UK/Lithuania | FX, crypto, global |
| N26 | 8M+ | Germany | Design-focused |
| Monzo | 9M+ | UK | Community, transparency |
| Starling | 4M+ | UK | SMB banking |
| Bunq | 12M+ | Netherlands | Green banking |

**European advantages:**
- PSD2 open banking mandate
- Faster Payments (UK), SEPA Instant
- Single market (pre-Brexit)
- Less entrenched mobile banking from incumbents

---

## Path to profitability

Most neobanks followed this evolution:

| Phase | Focus | Revenue |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1. Land grab** | User acquisition, free accounts | Interchange only |
| **2. Monetization** | Premium tiers, FX fees | Subscriptions |
| **3. Lending** | Personal loans, credit cards | Interest income |
| **4. Platform** | Marketplace, insurance, invest | Fees + float |

### Who's profitable?

| Company | Profitable? | How |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| [[Nubank]] | ✅ Yes (2023) | Credit expansion + scale |
| [[Revolut]] | ✅ Yes (2024) | Subscriptions + FX + crypto |
| Chime | ❌ No | Still interchange-dependent |
| N26 | ❌ No | Struggled with expansion |
| Monzo | ❌ No | UK-focused, lending scaling |
| [[SoFi]] | ✅ Yes (2024) | Lending + bank charter |

**The formula:** Need lending or high-margin products. Pure interchange doesn't work.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Credit losses** | Lending to underbanked = higher default |
| **Funding costs** | No sticky deposits like traditional banks |
| **Regulation** | Consumer protection, capital requirements |
| **Competition** | Traditional banks copying features |
| **Concentration** | Heavy reliance on partner banks (US) |
| **Rates** | Rising rates help float income, hurt growth valuations |

---

## Traditional bank response

| Bank | Digital offering | Success |
|------|------------------|---------|
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | Chase app, Finn (shut down) | Mixed |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | Marcus | Retreating |
| BBVA | Built neobank tech, sold to PNC | Exited |
| [[Itaú Unibanco]] | Iti wallet | Moderate |
| [[Bradesco]] | Next | Struggling |

Most traditional banks struggle to compete — legacy tech, branch costs, culture.
