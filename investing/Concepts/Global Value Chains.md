**Global Value Chains (GVCs)** — Production fragmented across countries, with each step happening where it's cheapest or best. A single product crosses borders dozens of times before completion. GVC length is fundamentally a **financial variable** — determined by working capital costs, not just labor arbitrage.

## How GVCs work

| Step | Example (iPhone) |
|------|------------------|
| Design | Apple (USA) |
| Chips | [[TSMC]] (Taiwan) |
| Memory | [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]] (Korea) |
| Display | Samsung, BOE (Korea/China) |
| Assembly | [[Foxconn]] (China) |
| Distribution | Global |

Each border crossing requires **working capital** — financing for inventory in transit, components at factories, goods on ships.

## The Shin framework

[[Hyun Song Shin]]'s research at [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] reframes GVCs as a financial phenomenon:

**Core insight:** ~80% of trade finance is dollar-denominated. GVC length depends on the cost of this financing.

| Dollar condition | GVC effect |
|------------------|------------|
| Weak dollar / easy credit | Chains extend (chase lowest-cost production) |
| Strong dollar / tight credit | Chains contract (reshoring, nearshoring) |

This is **opposite to textbook trade theory**, which says a strong dollar makes US imports cheaper. Shin shows a strong dollar tightens the credit that lubricates global trade — even between non-US countries.

**The broad dollar index is a proxy for global financial conditions**, not just US competitiveness.

### Key papers

| Paper | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| **Theory of supply chains** (2023) | GVC length = f(financing costs). Firms balance productivity gains vs working capital costs |
| **Dollar and Exports** (2019) | Exporters reliant on dollar credit suffer more when dollar strengthens — credit channel dominates competitiveness channel |
| **Exchange rates and working capital channel** (2018) | Trade finance is 80% USD. Strong dollar → tight dollar credit → lower trade volumes |

## Why GVCs matter for investors

### Structural trends

| Trend | Driver | Winners | Losers |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Reshoring** | Geopolitics, COVID | US/Mexico manufacturing | China assembly |
| **Nearshoring** | Supply chain risk | Mexico, Vietnam | Long-haul logistics |
| **Friend-shoring** | Security concerns | Allied nations | China tech |
| **Regionalization** | Tight dollar credit | Regional hubs | Global integrators |

### Macro signals

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| DXY rising | GVCs under pressure, trade volumes may fall |
| Fed tightening | Working capital costs rise, chains shorten |
| Trade finance spreads widening | Stress in GVC financing |
| Shipping rates collapsing | Demand destruction in goods trade |

## GVC exposure by sector

| Sector | GVC intensity | Key nodes |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Semiconductors** | Extreme | Design (US) → Fab (Taiwan/Korea) → Assembly (China/Malaysia) → Test (SE Asia) |
| **Automotive** | High | Parts cross borders 4-6x before final assembly |
| **Pharma** | High | API (China/India) → Formulation → Packaging |
| **Apparel** | High | Fabric (China) → Cut (Vietnam) → Sew (Bangladesh) |
| **Software** | Low | Digital delivery, minimal physical GVC |

## Post-COVID restructuring

COVID exposed GVC fragility — a single port closure or chip shortage cascaded globally.

| Shift | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Inventory buffers | Just-in-time → just-in-case |
| Dual sourcing | Apple adding India alongside China |
| Regionalization | EU "strategic autonomy," US CHIPS Act |
| Vertical integration | Tesla making own chips, batteries |

[[Hyun Song Shin]]'s 2023 speech: post-COVID disruptions + Fed tightening (stronger dollar) = structural pressure toward shorter, regionalized chains.
