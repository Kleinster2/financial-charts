**Donroe Doctrine** — Trump's Monroe Doctrine. Western Hemisphere led by US. "Donald + Monroe = Donroe." Not ownership — **leadership**. US as hemisphere hegemon.

Part of [[Trump II]] hub.

---

## Original Monroe (1823)

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| No European colonization | Americas off-limits to Europe |
| No European interference | US protects hemisphere |
| US non-intervention in Europe | Reciprocal |

Dormant for decades. Trump II revives it — aggressively.

---

## Donroe (2025-)

| Principle | Trump version |
|-----------|---------------|
| US leads hemisphere | Not ownership — hegemony |
| Strategic assets secured | Greenland, Panama Canal |
| **No Russia/China** | Foreign powers excluded |
| Regimes comply or face consequences | Venezuela intervention |

Not defensive (Monroe). **Assertive leadership.**

---

## No Russia/China in the Americas

Core principle: Great power rivals have no place in US hemisphere.

| Power | Presence being targeted |
|-------|------------------------|
| **China** | Panama Canal ports, Venezuela oil/debt, trade deals |
| **Russia** | Venezuela military support, Cuba ties |

| Target | Russia/China angle |
|--------|-------------------|
| Venezuela | China oil access now requires US approval, Russia alliance ended |
| Panama | Remove Chinese port operators |
| Cuba | Lifeline was via Venezuela — now cut (see [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]]) |

This is Monroe's original intent (keep Europe out) updated for modern rivals.

---

## Targets

| Target | Claim | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Greenland** | "We need it" — strategic, resources | Rhetoric, pressure on Denmark |
| **Panama Canal** | "Give it back" — China influence | Threats |
| **Venezuela** | "We'll run it" | Intervention achieved |
| **Cuba** | Next after Venezuela | Pending — see [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] |
| **Canada** | "51st state" rhetoric | Trolling? Pressure? |

---

## Greenland

| Factor | US interest |
|--------|-------------|
| Strategic | Arctic access, Russia/China counter |
| Resources | Rare earths, oil, minerals |
| Military | Thule Air Base |
| Climate | Melting ice = new routes |

Denmark says not for sale. Trump says we'll see.

---

## Panama Canal

| Factor | US interest |
|--------|-------------|
| Built by US | 1904-1914 |
| Returned | 1999 (Carter treaty) |
| China presence | Ports on both ends (Hutchison) |
| Fees | US ships pay "too much" |

Trump: China shouldn't control it. Implicit: Neither should Panama.

---

## vs Original Monroe

| Monroe (1823) | Donroe (2025) |
|---------------|---------------|
| Defensive | Assertive |
| Keep Europe out | Take what we want |
| Protect hemisphere | Control hemisphere |
| Sovereignty respected | Sovereignty conditional |
| Soft power | [[Propaganda thru Force]] |

---

## Connection to other doctrines

| Doctrine | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| [[Propaganda thru Force]] | How Donroe is communicated |
| [[Regime Compliance Doctrine]] | What happens to non-compliant hemisphere regimes |

Donroe defines the sphere. Other doctrines enforce it.

---

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Trump** | Doctrine author |
| **Rubio** | State — hemisphere focus, Cuban-American |
| **Waltz** | NSA — strategic framing |

---

## Investment implications

**Hemisphere instability:**
- EM Latin America risk premium
- Panama Canal disruption risk
- Arctic/Greenland resource plays

**Winners:**
- US Arctic companies
- Defense contractors
- Domestic alternatives to Panama route
