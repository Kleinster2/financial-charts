# Sodium-Ion Batteries

Next-generation battery chemistry using sodium instead of lithium. No lithium, cobalt, or nickel required. CATL and BYD targeting mass production 2026.

## Why sodium-ion matters

| Advantage | vs. Lithium-ion |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **No lithium** | Eliminates supply chain bottleneck |
| **Abundant materials** | Sodium is everywhere (salt) |
| **Cost** | 30-40% cheaper at scale, potentially 70% long-term |
| **Cold performance** | Works better in extreme cold |
| **Safety** | More stable, lower fire risk |
| **Fast charging** | Comparable to LFP |

| Disadvantage | vs. Lithium-ion |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Energy density** | Lower (~160-175 Wh/kg vs 200+ for LFP) |
| **Range** | Shorter per kg of battery |
| **Maturity** | Still scaling |

## Key players

| Company | Product | Status | Capacity |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| **[[CATL]]** | Naxtra | Mass production Q3 2025 | 10 GWh → 30 GWh (2026) |
| **[[BYD]]** | MC Cube-SIB | Grid storage focus | 30 GWh factory (broke ground Jan 2024) |
| **HiNa Battery** | — | China startup | Early production |
| **Faradion** | — | UK (acquired by Reliance) | Pilot scale |
| **Natron Energy** | — | US, data center focus | Niche |

China dominates — CATL and BYD alone control 50%+ of global EV battery market.

## CATL Naxtra

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Brand launch | April 2025 |
| Energy density | 175 Wh/kg (next-gen) |
| Range | 500 km in passenger vehicles |
| Certification | First to pass China GB 38031-2025 safety standard |
| 2026 deployment | EVs, commercial vehicles, battery swap, grid storage |

**"Dual-star" strategy:** Developing sodium-ion and lithium-ion in parallel.

---

## BYD sodium-ion

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Factory | 30 GWh (broke ground Jan 2024) |
| Focus | Grid storage (MC Cube-SIB) |
| Cost target | Parity with LFP, 70% cheaper long-term |
| Delivery | Q3 2025 (China) |

---

## Use cases

| Application | Why sodium-ion |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Low-cost EVs** | Cheaper than LFP, good enough range |
| **Grid storage** | Cost matters more than density |
| **Cold climates** | Better low-temp performance |
| **Two-wheelers** | Weight less critical |

Not suited for: Long-range premium EVs (density matters)

## Timeline

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2021 | CATL announces first-gen sodium-ion |
| 2024 | BYD breaks ground on 30 GWh factory |
| Q3 2025 | CATL mass production begins (~10 GWh) |
| July 2026 | China safety standard GB 38031-2025 takes effect |
| 2026 | Large-scale commercial deployment (CATL, BYD) |

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Lithium price hedge — reduces battery cost volatility
- China leads, could export tech
- Grid storage TAM expansion
- Cold climate markets (Nordics, Canada, Russia)

**Bear case:**
- Energy density gap persists
- LFP costs still falling
- Limited non-China production
- Niche use cases only
