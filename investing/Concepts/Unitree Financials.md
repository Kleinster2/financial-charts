Unitree Financials — [[Unitree]] has been profitable every year since 2020, a claim so unusual in robotics that it deserves scrutiny. No Western legged robotics company has achieved sustained profitability. [[Boston Dynamics]] lost ~$310M in 2024 alone, after 32 years. [[Figure AI]] has $2.6B in funding and zero revenue from robot sales.

## Revenue trajectory

| Year | Est. revenue (yuan) | Est. revenue (USD) | Key drivers |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 2020 | ~50-100M | ~$7-14M | A1 quadruped; first profitable year |
| 2021 | ~150-250M | ~$23-38M | Go1 launch ($2,700); first consumer robot dog |
| 2022 | ~300-500M | ~$42-70M | Go1 scale-up; B1 industrial |
| 2023 | ~500-800M | ~$70-110M | Go2 ($1,600); H1 humanoid launch |
| 2024 | >1B | ~$140M | 23,700 quadrupeds, 1,500+ humanoids |
| Q1 2025 | 3.27B | ~$450M | G1 mass shipments; R1 consumer humanoid |

Q1 2025 was 3x the entire 2024 annual revenue. Drivers: humanoid shipments (5,000 G1s in H1 2025 at ¥99K each), enterprise procurement (China Mobile ¥46M, automotive deals), possible seasonality, growing international sales (~50% of revenue overseas per CSDN). If the run rate sustains, full-year 2025 could reach 8-13B yuan ($1.1-1.8B).

Institutional forecasts (per 36Kr, citing broker research): net profit 1.415B yuan (2025), 1.856B yuan (2026), 2.287B yuan (2027).

## Margin structure

Q1 2025: revenue 3.27B yuan, net profit 480M yuan = 14.7% net margin. Gross margin reportedly stable above 50%.

| Metric | Unitree (2025 est.) | [[FANUC]] | [[Boston Dynamics]] | [[DJI]] (est.) |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Gross margin | >50% | 37% | Negative (est.) | ~45-55% |
| Net margin | ~14.7% (Q1 2025) | ~18% | Deeply negative | ~20-25% |

Why margins exceed industrial robot companies: [[Unitree]] sells differentiated legged robots with no comparable alternatives at their price points — pricing power from uniqueness. EDU variants lift blended margins (same hardware, software premium). 90% in-house components eliminate supplier markup.

Humanoid gross margins are ~8 percentage points higher than quadruped (per underwriting team sources). As humanoids grow to 50%+ of revenue, blended margins should expand.

## Unit economics by product line

| Product | Price | Est. BOM | Est. gross margin | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Go2 Air | $1,600 | $500-800 | 50-65% | Volume driver; actuator scale |
| Go2 EDU | $8-12K | $1,000-1,500 | 75-85% | Highest margin — SDK = pure software margin |
| B2 industrial | $20K | $3-5K | 70-80% | Enterprise pricing; IP67 |
| G1 humanoid | $16K | $5-8K | 50-65% | Growth driver; 5,000 shipped H1 2025 |
| R1 humanoid | $5,900 | $2.5-4K | 30-50% | Consumer humanoid; aggressive pricing |
| H1 humanoid | $90K | $15-25K | 65-75% | Research tier; low volume, high margin |

Profit engine analysis: G1 humanoid and B2/H1 enterprise products drive actual profit. Go2 Air at $1,600 is an ecosystem builder — drives actuator volume and brand, but profit comes from higher-ASP products. See [[Unitree Cost Architecture]] for detailed BOM analysis.

## Funding history

| Round | Date | Amount | Lead / key investors |
|-------|------|--------|---------------------|
| Seed | ~2017 | 2M yuan | Yin Fangming (angel) |
| Pre-A / A / A+ | 2020-2021 | Undisclosed | [[Sequoia]] Seed, Shunwei, Matrix |
| B / B+ | 2022-2024 | ~$139M | [[Meituan]], Source Code Capital |
| C | Sep 2024 | Hundreds of millions yuan | [[CITIC]], Beijing Robotics Fund |
| C+ | Jun 2025 | ~700M yuan (~$99M) | China Mobile Capital, [[Tencent]], [[Alibaba]], [[Geely]] |

Total raised: >1.5B yuan (~$264M) across 10 rounds. Post-C+ valuation exceeded 12B yuan (~$1.7B). 31 investors. [[Meituan]] is second-largest shareholder at 8.24%.

VC money is growth accelerant, not survival capital — the company could survive without it. Fundraising is strategic (factory expansion, investor alignment pre-IPO), not existential.

## IPO

| Milestone | Date | Detail |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Joint-stock restructure | May 2025 | Required for A-share listing |
| Pre-IPO tutoring began | Jul 2025 | Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau |
| Tutoring completed | Nov 2025 | 4 months (typical: 6-12) |
| Expected listing | Mid-2026 | Shanghai [[STAR Market]] |
| Target valuation | ~$7B (50B yuan) | Per Reuters (Sep 2025) |
| Underwriter | [[CITIC Securities]] | |

[[Wang Xingxing]] holds 34.76% as controlling shareholder. Would be among the first pure humanoid robotics IPOs globally.

## Valuation comps

At $7B target IPO valuation:

| Metric | Unitree | [[FANUC]] | [[UBTech]] (HKEX) |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Revenue | ~$1.8B (2025 ann.) | $5.4B | ~$600M |
| P/S | ~3.9x | ~5.2x | ~10x |
| P/E | ~36x (on 2025E profit) | ~35x | N/A (unprofitable) |

On 2026 forecast profit of 1.856B yuan (~$255M), implied P/E drops to ~27x. STAR Market AI/robotics names routinely trade at 50-100x.

Bull: $7B is conservative. At 15x on $1.4B revenue, fair value could be $21B. Post-IPO hype in A-shares could push to $15-20B within months.

Bear: Q1 2025 was a blowout driven by one-time orders. Sustainable revenue closer to $500-800M makes $7B a 9-14x P/S — expensive for hardware.

## Pre-IPO scrutiny areas

- Accounts receivable — government/university procurement has 90-180 day cycles; watch AR as % of revenue
- Related-party transactions — [[Meituan]] (8.24%), [[Tencent]], [[Alibaba]], [[Geely]] are investors and potential customers
- Government subsidies — Binjiang District allocates 15% of budget to high-tech; how much profit is organic?
- R&D capitalization — CAS allows capitalizing development costs; compare expensed vs. capitalized
- Revenue recognition — Q1 2025 spike (3x annual 2024) needs quarterly cadence context
- Inventory — 30-40K units produced in 2025; watch turns for demand softness signals

## Margin outlook

Expansion drivers: humanoid gross margins ~8pp higher, enterprise buyers less price-sensitive, software/SDK revenue grows, actuator volume continues, operating leverage.

Compression risks: R1 at $5,900 is aggressively priced (~30-45% GM), humanoid BOM fundamentally higher, enterprise sales need dedicated support, competition intensifies ([[Tesla]] Optimus targeting <$20K), international expansion adds costs.

Most likely outcome: blended gross margins hold ~50% or expand, operating margins compress from ~15-20% to ~12-18% as company invests in sales/international/R&D. Net margins stabilize ~12-15%.

[[DJI]] analog: maintained ~45-55% gross margins as it scaled from $500M to $3.5B. Product mix shifted from consumer (lower margin) to enterprise (higher margin) with software growing as revenue stream. If [[Unitree]] follows the same path, margin outlook is favorable.
