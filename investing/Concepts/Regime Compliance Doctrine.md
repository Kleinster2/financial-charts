**Regime Compliance Doctrine** — Force compliance through fear, not regime change. Keep the regime, change the behavior. Demonstrated willingness to act makes threats credible.

Part of [[Trump II]] hub.

## The shift

| Old model (Bush/Obama) | New model (Trump II) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Regime change | Regime compliance |
| Remove leader | Intimidate leader |
| Install democracy | Force behavior change |
| Nation building | Extraction/control |
| Iraq, Libya | Venezuela, Colombia, [[Iran]] |

**Why the shift:** Regime change is expensive, messy, creates vacuums. Compliance is cheaper — credible threat + demonstrated action = behavior change.

---

## How it works

```
Credible threat → Demonstrated action → Fear → Compliance
```

Venezuela was the demonstration. Now other regimes believe US will act.

## Targets

| [[Target]] | Status | Compliance sought | Leverage |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Venezuela** | Achieved | US running country | Military capture |
| **Colombia** | Attempting | Cooperation on drugs, migration | Tariff threats, Venezuela example |
| **[[Iran]]** | Attempting | Nuclear program, proxies | Sanctions, military posture |
| **[[Russia]]** | Attempting | Ukraine settlement | Sanctions, support for Ukraine |

## Venezuela as proof of concept

| Element | How Venezuela proved it |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Willingness** | US captured sitting leader |
| **Speed** | First week of term |
| **Unilateral** | No UN, no coalition |
| **Control** | "US will run Venezuela" |

Other regimes watched. Message received: US will act.

## vs Regime Change

| Regime Change | Regime Compliance |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Iraq 2003 | Venezuela 2026 |
| Remove Saddam | Capture Maduro |
| Install democracy | US runs country |
| 20-year occupation | Temporary control |
| $2T+ cost | Minimal cost |
| Created ISIS | Created leverage |

Compliance is regime change without the mess.

## Key actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Trump** | Decision maker |
| **Rubio** | State — diplomatic pressure |
| **Hegseth** | DoD — military credibility |
| **Waltz** | NSA — coordination |

---

## Investment implications

**If compliance works:**
- Reduced conflict risk (behavior change without war)
- [[Oil]] stability ([[Iran]], Venezuela cooperate)
- EM volatility (fear of being next)

**If compliance fails:**
- Escalation risk
- Actual military action
- Regional instability
