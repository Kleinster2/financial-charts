**Japanese yen** — World's third most traded currency. Historically a safe haven, now defined by BoJ policy divergence and carry trade dynamics. Weakest major currency 2021-2024, recovering in 2025.

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USDJPY | ~155 |
| 2025 return | Volatile (touched 160, now ~155) |
| BoJ rate | 0.50% |
| Fed rate | 3.50-3.75% |
| Rate differential | **~325bp** (narrowing) |

## Why JPY has been weak (2021-2024)

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Rate differential** | BoJ at 0% while Fed hiked to 5%+ |
| **Carry trade funding** | Borrow yen cheap, invest elsewhere |
| **BoJ YCC** | Yield curve control suppressed JGB yields |
| **Trade deficit** | Energy imports post-Fukushima |

USDJPY went from 103 (Jan 2021) to 160+ (2024 high).

## BoJ normalization (2024-2026)

BoJ finally exiting decades of ultra-loose policy:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Mar 2024 | First rate hike since 2007 (0% → 0.1%) |
| Jul 2024 | Second hike to 0.25% |
| Jan 2025 | Third hike to 0.50% |
| 2026E | Expected to reach 0.75-1.0% |

**Impact:** Narrowing rate differential supports yen, but still wide vs USD.

---

## Carry trade dynamics

JPY is the world's primary funding currency:

1. Borrow yen at near-zero rates
2. Invest in higher-yielding assets (USD, MXN, AUD)
3. Pocket the spread + any asset appreciation

**Unwind risk:** If BoJ hikes aggressively or risk-off hits, carry trades unwind violently → yen spikes.

**Aug 2024 example:** BoJ surprise hike triggered carry unwind, USDJPY dropped from 160 to 142 in days. Global equities sold off.

---

## Safe haven status

Historically yen strengthens in risk-off:
- Flight to quality (Japan = net creditor nation)
- Carry trade unwind (yen shorts cover)
- Repatriation (Japanese investors bring money home)

**Recent change:** 2022-2024 yen lost safe haven bid due to extreme rate differential. May return as spread narrows.

---

## Intervention levels

MoF/BoJ have intervened to support yen:

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 160 | Verbal warnings ("excessive moves") |
| 162 | Likely intervention zone |
| 165+ | Almost certain intervention |

**Oct 2022, Oct 2024:** MoF spent ~$60B defending yen near 160.

## 2026 outlook

| View | USDJPY Target |
|------|---------------|
| Bullish JPY | 140-145 (BoJ hikes, Fed cuts) |
| Base case | 150-155 |
| Bearish JPY | 160+ (Fed pauses, BoJ disappoints) |

**Key variable:** Pace of BoJ normalization vs Fed cutting.
