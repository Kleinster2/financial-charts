**Japanese yen** — World's third most traded currency. Historically a safe haven, now defined by BoJ policy divergence and carry trade dynamics. Weakest major currency 2021-2024, recovering in 2025.

## NY Fed rate check (Jan 24, 2026)

**The event that crashed USDJPY:**

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| **Jan 24 (Fri)** | NY Fed asks banks for USD/JPY positions at London close (17:00 GMT) |
| **Immediate** | USDJPY craters — "rate check" is final step before intervention |
| **Jan 25-27** | Yen rallies ~4% as intervention fears spread |
| **Jan 29** | [[Scott Bessent]] denies intervention plans, reaffirms "strong dollar policy" |

**Why it mattered:**

A "rate check" is when a central bank asks dealers for exchange rates — signals imminent intervention. The shock:
- **It was the Fed, not BoJ** — Fed has infinite capacity to sell dollars (unlike BoJ with limited reserves)
- **Fed didn't clarify it was acting as Japan's agent** — implied possible joint US-Japan intervention
- Market participants scrambled to cover yen shorts

**Japanese officials' response:**
- Currency official Atsushi Mimura: "will respond to currency movements as needed in close coordination with Washington"
- Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama: "authorities are acting in line with US-Japan joint statement"

**Why would US want weaker dollar?**
- Yen weakness amplifying [[JGB]] selloff → pushing US Treasury yields higher
- Strong dollar hurts US exports
- Trump has signaled comfort with weaker dollar

**Bessent's denial (Jan 29):** Ruled out US intervention to sell dollars, but the positioning damage was done. DXY still at 4-year lows.

## Why JPY has been weak (2021-2024)

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Rate differential** | BoJ at 0% while Fed hiked to 5%+ |
| **Carry trade funding** | Borrow yen cheap, invest elsewhere |
| **BoJ YCC** | Yield curve control suppressed [[JGB]] yields |
| **[[Trade]] deficit** | Energy imports post-Fukushima |

USDJPY went from 103 (Jan 2021) to 160+ (2024 high).

## BoJ normalization (2024-2026)

BoJ finally exiting decades of ultra-loose policy:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Mar 2024 | First rate hike since 2007 (0% → 0.1%) |
| Jul 2024 | Second hike to 0.25% |
| Jan 2025 | Third hike to 0.50% |
| 2026E | Expected to reach 0.75-1.0% |

**Impact:** Narrowing rate differential supports yen, but still wide vs USD.

---

## Carry trade dynamics

JPY is the world's primary funding currency:

1. Borrow yen at near-zero rates
2. Invest in higher-yielding assets (USD, MXN, AUD)
3. Pocket the spread + any asset appreciation

**Unwind risk:** If BoJ hikes aggressively or risk-off hits, carry trades unwind violently → yen spikes.

**Aug 2024 example:** BoJ surprise hike triggered carry unwind, USDJPY dropped from 160 to 142 in days. Global equities sold off.

---

## Safe haven status

Historically yen strengthens in risk-off:
- Flight to quality (Japan = net creditor nation)
- Carry trade unwind (yen shorts cover)
- Repatriation (Japanese investors bring money home)

**Recent change:** 2022-2024 yen lost safe haven bid due to extreme rate differential. May return as spread narrows.

---

## Intervention levels

MoF/BoJ have intervened to support yen:

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 160 | Verbal warnings ("excessive moves") |
| 162 | Likely intervention zone |
| 165+ | Almost certain intervention |

**Oct 2022, Oct 2024:** MoF spent ~$60B defending yen near 160.

**Jan 2026:** NY Fed rate check near 158 triggered 4% yen rally without actual intervention — just the threat moved markets.

## 2026 outlook

| View | USDJPY [[Target]] |
|------|---------------|
| Bullish JPY | 140-145 (BoJ hikes, Fed cuts) |
| Base case | 150-155 |
| Bearish JPY | 160+ (Fed pauses, BoJ disappoints) |

**Key variable:** Pace of BoJ normalization vs Fed cutting.
