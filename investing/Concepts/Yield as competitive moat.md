In semiconductor manufacturing, **yield** (percentage of working chips per wafer) directly determines profitability and customer trust.

## Why it matters

- Low yields → higher cost per working chip → uncompetitive pricing
- Unpredictable yields → unreliable supply → customers leave
- Yield problems compound: one bad batch can delay product launches

## Current state (late 2025)

| Foundry | Leading-edge yields |
|---------|---------------------|
| [[TSMC]] | 60-70%+ (mature) |
| [[Samsung]] | 55-60% at 2nm (improving from 10-20%) |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Unproven at 18A |

## Strategic implications

- [[TSMC]] treats yield maturity as prerequisite for geographic expansion
- [[Samsung]] must achieve rapid yield improvement to validate [[Samsung Taylor pivot]]
- Yield is harder to leapfrog than node transitions — it's accumulated learning
