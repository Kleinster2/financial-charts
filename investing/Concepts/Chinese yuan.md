## PBOC management

Yuan is a managed float, not free-floating:

| Tool | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Daily fix** | PBOC sets reference rate each morning |
| **Trading band** | ±2% from fix |
| **FX reserves** | $3T+ for intervention |
| **Capital controls** | Limit outflows |

---

## Why PBOC manages yuan

| Goal | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Export competitiveness** | Prevent excessive appreciation |
| **Financial stability** | Prevent capital flight |
| **[[Inflation]] control** | Import prices |
| **Internationalization** | Gradual opening |

## Structural pressures (bearish CNY)

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Property crisis** | Deflationary, capital outflows |
| **Growth slowdown** | Reduced inflows |
| **Rate cuts** | PBOC easing |
| **US-China tensions** | De-risking flows |
| **Demographics** | Long-term headwind |

## Reserve currency ambitions

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Global reserves | ~2.5% (vs USD 58%) |
| SWIFT payments | ~4% |
| [[Trade]] invoicing | Growing ([[BRICS]]) |
| Obstacles | Capital controls, rule of law |

**Reality:** CNY reserve status limited by unwillingness to open capital account.
