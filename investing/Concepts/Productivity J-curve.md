# Productivity J-curve

General-purpose technologies (GPTs) suppress measured productivity before boosting it. Firms invest heavily in intangible capital — process redesign, retraining, new business models — that doesn't show up in output statistics. Only after this investment phase do gains appear in the data. The "J" shape: productivity dips or stagnates, then accelerates.

Framework originates from [[Stanford]] Digital Economy Lab research by Erik Brynjolfsson and colleagues.

## The mechanism

| Phase | What happens | Measured productivity |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Investment | Firms reorganize workflows, retrain staff, build complementary systems | Suppressed — resources diverted from output |
| Transition | Early adopters begin harvesting gains; most firms still investing | Inflection — starts rising |
| Harvest | Reorganization complete; AI augments output at scale | Accelerating — gains compound |

The delay isn't because the technology doesn't work — it's because deployment requires restructuring that takes years. Same pattern played out with electricity (1890s-1920s), IT (1990s-2000s), and now AI.

## Historical precedent

| Technology | Investment phase | Harvest phase | Lag |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|-----|
| Steam engine | 1770s-1800s | 1830s+ | ~50 years |
| Electricity | 1880s-1910s | 1920s+ | ~30 years |
| Computer/IT | 1970s-1990s | Late 1990s-2000s | ~20 years |
| AI | ~2017-2024 | 2025+? | ~7 years (if confirmed) |

The Solow Paradox — "you can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics" (1987) — was the canonical expression of the investment phase for IT. Brynjolfsson argues the same paradox applied to AI until 2025.

## 2025 evidence (Brynjolfsson, Feb 2026)

| Signal | Data |
|--------|------|
| US productivity growth (2025) | ~2.7% — nearly 2x the prior decade's 1.4% average |
| GDP growth (Q4 2025) | 3.7% |
| Payroll revision | -403K jobs (BLS benchmark revision) |
| Decoupling | High output + lower labor input = productivity |

Entry-level hiring in AI-exposed sectors declined ~16% (Brynjolfsson, Chandar, Chen research), while AI-augmented workers saw growing employment. Consistent with firms substituting AI for codified, junior tasks.

## Relationship to [[Productivity]]

The J-curve is the *theory*; [[Productivity]] tracks the *data*. If the J-curve thesis is correct, the Q3 2025 (+4.9% annualized) and full-year 2025 (~2.7%) readings mark the harvest phase inflection. If wrong, these are noise in a volatile series.

## Investment implications

If the J-curve is real:
- Productivity growth is durable, not cyclical — supports higher earnings growth at lower inflation
- [[GS AI Productivity Beneficiaries]] basket thesis strengthens (labor cost reduction compounds)
- Margin expansion broadens beyond tech into logistics, banking, healthcare, restaurants
- Fed can cut more aggressively if unit labor costs keep falling

Risks:
- Productivity metrics are volatile — several more quarters needed to confirm trend
- Geopolitical disruption (tariffs, trade wars) could offset efficiency gains
- "Jobless growth" scenario — productivity rises but labor displacement accelerates faster than reabsorption
- Most firms still in "glorified dictionary" usage — gap between power users and average adoption is wide
