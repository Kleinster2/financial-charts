## Context

JPMorgan has the infrastructure bull basket but **no equivalent disruption/bear basket**. Their analyst Toby Ogg wrote the defining quote on the software selloff — "the sector isn't just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial" — but JPM didn't formalize a trackable disruption index.

Ogg's findings from 50+ investor meetings (Jan 2026): investors have "significantly reduced holdings in the software sector" over 12-18 months. But this observation was published as research commentary, not as a basket product.
