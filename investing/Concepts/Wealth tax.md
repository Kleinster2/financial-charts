# Wealth tax

An annual tax levied on an individual's **net assets** (total wealth minus liabilities), as opposed to income or capital gains taxes which tax flows. One of the most debated instruments in fiscal policy because of the tension between redistribution goals and [[Capital flight]] risk.

## How it works

Unlike income tax (taxes earnings) or capital gains tax (taxes realized profits), a wealth tax applies to the **stock** of wealth regardless of whether it generates income. This creates a unique problem: illiquid business owners may owe taxes they can't pay without selling assets or extracting dividends from their companies.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tax base | Net assets: real estate, financial assets, business equity, minus debt |
| Rate | Typically 0.5%–2.5% annually |
| Threshold | Usually applies above a high minimum (e.g., NOK 1.7M in [[Norway]], €1.3M proposed in [[France]]) |
| Valuation | Contentious — discounts for primary residence, business assets vary by jurisdiction |

## The Laffer curve problem

Wealth taxes sit on the steep part of the [[Laffer curve]] for mobile capital. Unlike real estate (immovable) or labour income (hard to relocate), financial wealth is **highly mobile**. Small rate increases can trigger disproportionate revenue losses through emigration.

### Norway case study (2022)

The most cited modern example. [[Norway]] raised its wealth tax from 0.85% to 1.1% in 2022:

| Expected | Actual |
|----------|--------|
| +$146M revenue | -$448M net loss |
| — | $54B in wealth left the country |
| — | $594M in lost tax revenue |
| — | 500+ wealthy residents emigrated in 2022–2023 |

The viral infographic framing — "expected $146M, got -$448M" — overstates the damage to total fiscal revenues (the broadly-applied tax still raised more overall), but accurately captures the **marginal return** of the rate hike on the ultra-wealthy.

### Sweden (2007)

[[Sweden]] abolished its wealth tax entirely in 2007 after decades of [[Capital flight]]. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad had moved to Switzerland in 1973; the Tetra Pak family left in the 1980s. Sweden concluded the administrative cost and capital flight exceeded revenue.

### France (2017)

[[France]] replaced its wealth tax (ISF) with a real-estate-only wealth tax (IFI) under Macron in 2017, exempting financial assets. The reform was politically controversial ("president of the rich") but stemmed capital outflows.

## Countries with active wealth taxes

As of 2025, only a handful of OECD countries maintain broad wealth taxes:
- **[[Norway]]** — 1% / 1.1% (two-tier since 2022)
- **Spain** — 0.2%–3.5% (temporary "solidarity tax" on assets >€3M)
- **Switzerland** — varies by canton, typically 0.3%–1%
- **Colombia** — 0.5%–1.5%

Most OECD countries that had wealth taxes have abolished them: Austria (1994), Denmark (1997), Germany (1997), Finland (2006), Sweden (2007), France (2017, partial).

## Investment implications

- Wealth taxes are a **headwind for domestic asset valuations** in affected jurisdictions — forced selling to pay tax reduces demand
- [[Capital flight]] creates opportunities in destination countries (Switzerland, UAE, Singapore, London)
- Countries considering wealth taxes (US progressive proposals, UK Labour debates) should study the Norway/Sweden/France precedents
- Exit taxes (like Norway's 37.8% on unrealised gains) are the counter-mechanism — their effectiveness determines whether capital can actually leave
