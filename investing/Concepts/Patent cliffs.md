**Patent cliffs** — The sudden loss of sales exclusivity on a blockbuster drug. Stocks trade at fearful valuations before the cliff, but history shows they often play out as "cliffhangers" — with years of extra growth, cash reinvestment into successors, and eventual re-rating.

---

## The mechanics

US drug patents typically last **20 years from filing** (not from commercial launch). Effective exclusivity is usually 8-14 years. When a key patent expires, generic or biosimilar competitors can enter, often collapsing prices 70-90% for small molecules.

**But the cliff is rarely as sheer as feared.**

## Why cliffs become cliffhangers

| Defense | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Patent thickets** | Web of related patents (manufacturing, formulations, delivery) beyond composition of matter |
| **Biologic complexity** | Made in living cells — copying is technically difficult, unlike small-molecule generics |
| **New formulations** | Subcutaneous vs IV, extended-release — each gets fresh patents |
| **Label expansion** | New indications filed before expiry, creating switching costs |
| **Brand loyalty** | Physicians and patients reluctant to switch from proven drugs |
| **Regulatory lag** | Biosimilar approval takes 5-10 years even after patent expires |

## The investment pattern

| Phase | Valuation | Reality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Pre-cliff fear** | 9-12x earnings | Cash flow still strong, funding next-gen pipeline |
| **Cliff year** | Depends on thicket | Often 2-5 years of extra sales beyond expectations |
| **Post-cliff pivot** | 18-22x earnings | New drugs ramping, diversified revenue, de-risked |

**Key insight:** Patent cliff stocks generate enormous free cash flow precisely when the market is most pessimistic. That cash funds M&A and pipeline development that ultimately replaces the blockbuster.

## Case studies

### AbbVie / Humira (the template)

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| Dec 2016 | Composition of matter patent expires |
| 2016-2022 | Humira **keeps growing** — patent thicket + biologic complexity |
| 2022 | Peak at **$21.2B** ($5B above 2016 level) |
| 2024 | Biosimilar competition finally arrives (8 years after patent expiry) |
| 2025-26 | Skyrizi + Rinvoq at **$31B** (exceeding Humira peak) |
| 2030E | Skyrizi + Rinvoq → **$50B** |

**Result:** Stock returned **460%** over the decade. Forward P/E expanded from 11x to 21x. Market went from pricing extinction to pricing growth.

**What made it work:** Patent thicket bought time. Biologic manufacturing complexity deterred competitors. Surplus cash funded next-gen drugs in the same therapeutic area (autoimmune), enabling patient conversion rather than loss.

### Merck / Keytruda (in progress)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Keytruda revenue | $31.7B (49% of sales) |
| Patent expiry | December 2028 |
| Valuation | 11x 2027E earnings |
| Defense | Patent thicket + Keytruda Qlex (subcutaneous, new patents) |
| Pipeline | 80 Phase 3 trials, $70B+ revenue opportunity by mid-2030s |

**Bull case:** AbbVie-like outcome — minimal earnings decline, de-risked outlook, valuation re-rating by end of decade.

---

### Bristol-Myers Squibb (steepest cliff)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue at risk | **>75%** by 2031 |
| Valuation | <9x earnings (cheapest in Big Pharma) |
| Trough EPS (BofA) | ~$5 (vs $6.30 current) |
| Pipeline | Half-dozen blockbuster candidates, 10+ launches by 2030 |
| Dividend | 4.6% |

**Challenge:** Unlike AbbVie (one drug to replace) or Merck (one cliff), BMS faces multiple simultaneous expirations. Must replace ~$35B in revenue. Management targets return to growth by end of decade.

## What separates winners from losers

| Factor | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Drug type** | Biologic (hard to copy) | Small molecule (easy generics) |
| **Patent strategy** | Dense thicket | Single composition patent |
| **Pipeline timing** | Next-gen drugs ramping pre-cliff | Pipeline still in Phase 2 at cliff |
| **Therapeutic continuity** | New drug replaces old in same patients | Unrelated pipeline |
| **Cliff concentration** | Single blockbuster cliff | Multiple simultaneous expirations |
| **Cash deployment** | Aggressive M&A + internal R&D | Buybacks and dividends |

| Company | Drug | Cliff | Revenue | Defense quality |
|---------|------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| [[Merck]] | Keytruda | Dec 2028 | $31.7B | High (thicket + Qlex) |
| [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] | Multiple | 2026-2031 | >$35B | Moderate (volume, not depth) |
| [[AbbVie]] | Humira | Completed | — | Navigated successfully |
