# AI Video Generation

The use of [[Generative AI]] models to create video from text prompts, images, or other video. As of Feb 2026, the field has reached a quality inflection — outputs are increasingly indistinguishable from professional footage, triggering existential fears in Hollywood and major copyright confrontations.

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key players | [[Sora]] ([[OpenAI]]), Veo ([[Google]]), [[Kling]] ([[Kuaishou]]), [[Hailuo]] ([[MiniMax]]), [[Seedance]] ([[ByteDance]]), [[Runway Gen]] ([[Runway]]), Pika |
| Quality trajectory | Near-cinematic by early 2026 (vs. "uncanny valley" in 2023) |
| Typical output | 5–15 seconds, 1080p–4K, with native audio |
| Business models | Freemium (credits), subscription ($8–50/mo), API |
| Copyright status | Unresolved; active litigation and cease-and-desists |

## Competitive landscape (Feb 2026)

### US-based models

| Model | Developer | Version | Key features | Pricing |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| [[Sora]] | [[OpenAI]] | Sora 2 | Brand recognition, safety focus, narrative depth | ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo+) |
| Veo | [[Google]] | Veo 3.1/3.2 | Google ecosystem integration, invite-only | Gemini subscription |
| [[Runway Gen]] | [[Runway]] | Gen-4.5 | First-mover in creative tools, motion brushes, #1 benchmarks | From $12/mo |
| Pika | Pika | 2.5 | Viral effects (Pikaswaps, Pikaffects), fast renders, fun | From $8/mo |
| Luma Ray | [[Luma AI]] | Ray 3 | 4K HDR, physics simulation | From $7.99/mo |

### China-based models

| Model | Developer | Version | Key features | Pricing |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| [[Seedance]] | [[ByteDance]] | 2.0 | Cinematic quality, multimodal (text+image+audio), viral Feb 2026 | Free tier (Dreamina/[[CapCut]]) |
| [[Kling]] | [[Kuaishou]] | 3.0 | Native 4K, 60fps, 6-shot AI Director, multi-language audio | Paid subscribers |
| [[Hailuo]] | [[MiniMax]] | Hailuo 2 | Strong quality/price ratio, good controls | Free tier available |

**Key dynamic:** Chinese models ([[Kling]], [[Seedance]]) are iterating faster and deploying with fewer guardrails. US models ([[Sora]], Veo, [[Runway Gen]]) emphasize safety and IP compliance but risk falling behind on features.

## Quality trajectory

The improvement curve has been exponential:

| Period | State of the art |
|--------|-----------------|
| Early 2023 | Primitive; can't generate coherent walking, bad textures, 2–4 seconds |
| Late 2023 | Better consistency, still clearly AI, ~5 seconds |
| Mid 2024 | [[Sora]] preview shocks the industry; 1080p, 60 seconds (demo only) |
| Late 2024 | [[Kling]], [[Runway Gen]]-3 reach semi-professional quality |
| Early 2025 | [[Sora]] public launch; Veo 2; quality gap narrowing fast |
| Feb 2026 | [[Seedance]] 2.0, [[Kling]] 3.0 — near-cinematic, native audio, 15s clips from 2-line prompts |

Billy Boman (creative ad agency, Stockholm): "Back in 2023 it was difficult to get someone to run or walk. Now I can do anything. It has been nothing short of exceptional." (CNBC, Feb 14, 2026)

## Hollywood confrontation

The [[Seedance]] 2.0 launch (Feb 10–12, 2026) triggered the most serious AI copyright confrontation yet:

- Users generated clips of copyrighted characters (Spider-Man, Darth Vader, Baby Yoda, South Park) and celebrity likenesses (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt) from simple prompts
- [[Disney]] cease-and-desist: "virtual smash-and-grab" of IP (Feb 13)
- [[MPA]] demanded ByteDance "immediately cease infringing activity" (Feb 13)
- [[SAG-AFTRA]]: "blatant infringement... undercuts human talent" (Feb 13)
- [[Paramount Global]] cease-and-desist: content "indistinguishable" from their films (Feb 15)
- Human Artistry Campaign: "an attack on every creator around the world" (Feb 15)
- [[ByteDance]] pledged to "strengthen safeguards" (Feb 16, [[Reuters]])

Screenwriter Rhett Reese ([[Deadpool]]): "It's likely over for us."

**But studios aren't anti-AI:** [[Disney]] signed a 3-year licensing deal with [[OpenAI]] (Dec 2025) while simultaneously sending [[ByteDance]] a C&D. The issue is **unauthorized use**, not AI itself. Studios want to be paid.

## Market dynamics

**Who wins?**

The AI video generation market has characteristics that make it hard for any single player to dominate:

1. **Rapid commoditization** — quality parity arrives fast; today's breakthrough is tomorrow's baseline
2. **Distribution matters more than model quality** — [[ByteDance]] ([[CapCut]], [[TikTok]]), [[Google]] (YouTube), and [[OpenAI]] (ChatGPT) have distribution; startups like [[Runway]] and Pika don't
3. **Copyright is the moat** — companies with licensing deals ([[OpenAI]]-[[Disney]]) will have advantages over those without
4. **China moves faster** — fewer guardrails, faster iteration, but IP liability and geopolitical risk
5. **Aggregator platforms emerging** — RepublicLabs.ai and similar let users compare models side-by-side

**Investable angles:**
- [[Kuaishou]] (1024.HK) — only publicly traded pure-play; stock up >50% in past year on [[Kling]] success
- [[NVIDIA]] — all video models need massive GPU compute for training
- [[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]] — [[HBM]] demand from training infrastructure
- Studios ([[Disney]], [[Paramount Global]]) — licensing revenue from AI deals
- [[Runway]] — private, raised $141M Series D at $1.5B (2024)

---

## Risks

- **Copyright litigation** could constrain the entire sector
- **Hollywood licensing deals** may create winners (licensed) vs losers (pirate models)
- **Quality plateau** — unclear if improvements continue at current pace
- **Regulation** — EU AI Act, US executive orders could impose training data requirements
- **Deepfake concerns** — celebrity likenesses, misinformation, election interference
