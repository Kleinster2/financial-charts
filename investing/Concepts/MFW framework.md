**MFW framework** — The legal standard from *Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp.* (Delaware Supreme Court, 2014) that determines when a controlling shareholder can get the lenient "business judgment" review instead of the harsher "entire fairness" scrutiny in squeeze-out mergers and other self-dealing transactions.

---

## The problem it solves

When a controlling shareholder wants to buy out minority investors (a "freeze-out" or "squeeze-out" merger), the default standard is **entire fairness** — the court examines whether the price and process were fair. The burden is on the controller. This is the toughest standard in Delaware corporate law.

Controllers wanted a way to get the deferential **business judgment rule** instead — where courts basically don't second-guess the deal.

---

## The two conditions (both required)

To get business judgment review, the controller must condition the transaction **from the outset** on:

| Condition | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Independent special committee** | Board forms a committee of only independent, disinterested directors. Must be empowered to freely select its own advisors, negotiate the price, and **veto the deal** — without fear of retaliation |
| **Majority-of-minority vote** | A majority of the shares NOT held by the controller must approve the deal. Vote must be fully informed and uncoerced |

Both conditions must be established **before** negotiations begin — you can't bolt them on retroactively.

---

## Why it matters for investors

| Scenario | Standard of review | Investor protection |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Controller uses both MFW protections | Business judgment | Low — courts defer to the deal |
| Controller uses only one (or neither) | Entire fairness | High — court scrutinizes price + process |
| Controller skips both | Entire fairness (burden on controller) | Highest — controller must prove fairness |

**The catch:** If a controller follows the MFW playbook perfectly, it becomes very hard for minority shareholders to challenge the deal in court — even if the price feels low. The framework effectively gives sophisticated controllers a roadmap to insulate themselves from liability.

## Key cases

| Case | Year | Significance |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Kahn v. M&F Worldwide** | 2014 | Established the framework — both conditions → business judgment review |
| **In re Match Group** | 2024 | Delaware Supreme Court expanded MFW beyond squeeze-outs to ANY controller transaction with non-ratable benefit (reverse spinoffs, self-dealing agreements, etc.) |
| **Tornetta v. Musk** | 2024 | Chancellor McCormick found Musk was a controller at 21.9% ownership (influence, not just shares). His $56B Tesla comp package lacked proper MFW protections → struck down |

---

## Expanded scope (post-2024)

After *In re Match Group*, MFW applies to any controlling stockholder transaction where the controller gets a **non-ratable benefit** — not just freeze-out mergers. This includes:
- Service agreements with the controller
- Executive compensation for a controlling CEO
- Reverse spinoffs benefiting the parent
- Corporate redomiciliation (leaving Delaware)

This expansion significantly broadened minority shareholder protections — but also gave controllers a clearer playbook to follow.

## Investor framework

When evaluating controlled companies ([[Warner Music Group]], [[Meta]], Google, etc.):

1. **Does the controller have >50% voting power?** If yes, they can force any deal through
2. **Does the company have a track record of MFW-compliant processes?** Check for independent committees, minority votes
3. **What's the controller's incentive?** Blavatnik (WMG) could go private anytime. Zuckerberg (Meta) has no reason to — public market serves him
4. **Is there a valuation floor?** Appraisal rights exist, but litigation takes years and costs money

The real risk: a controller who follows MFW perfectly can take you out at a "fair" price that's still well below intrinsic value — and courts will defer.
