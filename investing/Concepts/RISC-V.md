# RISC-V

#concept #semiconductors #china #opensource

**RISC-V** — Open-source instruction set architecture (ISA). China's strategic bet to bypass ARM/x86 licensing and US export controls. State-backed "Silicon Sovereignty" strategy with nationwide policy (March 2025). Key players: Alibaba XuanTie, VeriSilicon+Nuclei, SpacemiT.

## What is RISC-V

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Type | Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) |
| Origin | UC Berkeley (2010) |
| License | **Open-source, royalty-free** |
| Governance | RISC-V International (Switzerland) |
| Alternative to | ARM (licensed), x86 (Intel/AMD proprietary) |

**Key difference from ARM:** No licensing fees, no export control restrictions, fully customizable.

---

## Why China is betting on RISC-V

| Driver | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **US export controls** | ARM licenses restricted for Chinese firms |
| **Self-sufficiency** | No foreign IP dependency |
| **Cost** | No royalties to ARM/Intel |
| **Customization** | Can optimize for specific workloads (AI, IoT) |
| **Security** | Full visibility into chip design |

**Strategic context:** US restricted Huawei, SMIC from advanced chips. RISC-V is the escape route.

## RISC-V vs ARM vs x86

| Factor | RISC-V | ARM | x86 |
|--------|--------|-----|-----|
| **License** | Open/free | Per-chip royalty | Proprietary |
| **Customization** | Full | Limited | None |
| **Ecosystem** | Growing | Mature | Mature |
| **Performance** | Catching up | Mobile leader | Server leader |
| **China access** | ✅ Unrestricted | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited |

## DeepSeek connection

RISC-V + efficient AI models = alternative to NVIDIA dependency.

| Insight | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| DeepSeek efficiency | Runs on lower-end chips |
| RISC-V opportunity | 30% performance at lower cost = viable at scale |
| China Mobile view | Multiple RISC-V units can match NVIDIA/Huawei |

See [[DeepSeek]], [[US-China tech race]].

## Global RISC-V landscape

| Region | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| **China** | State-backed, largest adoption |
| **Europe** | European Processor Initiative (EPI) |
| **India** | Shakti processor program |
| **US** | SiFive, Tenstorrent (startup-driven) |

**Irony:** US-origin technology (Berkeley) now powering China's chip independence.

## Investment implications

| Angle | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **China chip plays** | VeriSilicon, SpacemiT, Alibaba |
| **US incumbents at risk** | ARM (if China ecosystem succeeds) |
| **Beneficiaries** | RISC-V IP providers, toolchain companies |
| **Timeline** | 3-5 years to meaningful server share |

### Risks

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Ecosystem maturity** | Software/tools lag ARM |
| **Performance gap** | Still behind ARM/x86 in high-end |
| **Fragmentation** | Too many incompatible extensions |
| **US response** | Could restrict RISC-V tools/software |
