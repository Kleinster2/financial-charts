# US-China decoupling

The strategic separation of US and Chinese technology, trade, and financial ecosystems. What began as a trade war under [[Donald Trump]] in 2018 has evolved into a structural, bipartisan project to decouple the world's two largest economies — particularly in semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology.

## Key dimensions

### Technology decoupling
- Semiconductor export controls (Oct 2022, Oct 2023, Dec 2024) — US blocks sale of advanced chips and chipmaking equipment to China
- [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200/B200 banned for export to China; A800/H800 (China-specific) also restricted
- ASML ([[Netherlands]]) blocked from selling EUV lithography to China
- [[Huawei]] entity list restrictions since 2019
- AI model export restrictions under discussion

### Financial decoupling
- PCAOB audit access fight (2020-2022, partially resolved)
- Executive orders restricting US investment in Chinese AI/quantum/semiconductor companies
- Delisting threats for Chinese ADRs ([[Alibaba]], [[PDD]], [[JD.com]])
- [[CFIUS]] blocking Chinese acquisitions of US tech companies

### Supply chain decoupling
- CHIPS Act ($52B+ reshoring semiconductors to US) — co-authored by [[Todd Young]] and [[Chuck Schumer]]
- [[Pax Silica]] — US-led coalition for "friend-shoring" semiconductor supply chains
- "China Plus One" strategy — multinationals diversifying manufacturing out of China
- Rare earth and critical mineral supply chain diversification

### Data and internet decoupling
- [[TikTok]] forced-sale bill (2024) — national security concerns over Chinese data access
- Clean Network initiative (Trump 1.0)
- China's Great Firewall already blocks US platforms

## The investment thesis

Decoupling creates winners and losers:

Winners:
- US/allied semiconductor companies ([[NVIDIA]], [[TSMC]], [[ASML]])
- Defense tech ([[Palantir]], [[Anduril]])
- Reshoring beneficiaries (US industrial, construction, power infrastructure)
- India, Vietnam, Mexico as manufacturing alternatives

Losers:
- Companies with deep China exposure (Apple, Qualcomm, Tesla China)
- Chinese tech companies cut off from US tools ([[Huawei]], [[SMIC]])
- Global companies caught in the middle (forced to choose sides)

## Institutional nexus

The [[Hill and Valley Forum]] is the primary private-sector venue where decoupling policy gets incubated. Founded in March 2023 — timed to the TikTok congressional hearing — it brings together the tech executives building the tools of decoupling with the lawmakers writing the legislation. Every major decoupling policy of 2023-2025 traces back to this network:

| Policy | Forum connection |
|--------|-----------------|
| TikTok forced-sale bill (2024) | Lobbied by [[Jacob Helberg]] and [[Vinod Khosla]]; inaugural dinner timed to TikTok hearing |
| [[Pax Silica]] (2025) | Created by Helberg after he became Under Secretary of State |
| CHIPS Act ($52B+) | Co-authored by [[Todd Young]], forum speaker |
| Defense tech mainstreaming | [[Palantir]] (Alex Karp), [[Anduril]] — forum speakers turned default Pentagon vendors |
| AI export controls | [[Jensen Huang]] (NVIDIA), [[Lisa Su]] (AMD) — both speakers and subjects of the policy |

Key figures:
- [[Jacob Helberg]] — Under Secretary of State, forum founder, [[Pax Silica]] architect
- [[Peter Thiel]] — core member, early China hawk, [[Palantir]] co-founder
- [[Todd Young]] — CHIPS Act co-author, forum speaker
- [[Lindsey Graham]] — defense hawk, forum speaker
- [[Doug Burgum]] — Interior Secretary, called the forum "the conclave of Silicon Valley"
