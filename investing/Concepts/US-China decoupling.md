# US-China decoupling

The strategic separation of US and Chinese technology, trade, and financial ecosystems. What began as a trade war under [[Donald Trump]] in 2018 has evolved into a structural, bipartisan project to decouple the world's two largest economies — particularly in semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology.

## Key dimensions

### Technology decoupling
- Semiconductor export controls (Oct 2022, Oct 2023, Dec 2024) — US blocks sale of advanced chips and chipmaking equipment to China
- [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200/B200 banned for export to China; A800/H800 (China-specific) also restricted
- ASML ([[Netherlands]]) blocked from selling EUV lithography to China
- [[Huawei]] entity list restrictions since 2019
- AI model export restrictions under discussion

### Financial decoupling
- PCAOB audit access fight (2020-2022, partially resolved)
- Executive orders restricting US investment in Chinese AI/quantum/semiconductor companies
- Delisting threats for Chinese ADRs ([[Alibaba]], [[PDD]], [[JD.com]])
- [[CFIUS]] blocking Chinese acquisitions of US tech companies

### Supply chain decoupling
- CHIPS Act ($52B+ reshoring semiconductors to US) — co-authored by [[Todd Young]] and [[Chuck Schumer]]
- [[Pax Silica]] — US-led coalition for "friend-shoring" semiconductor supply chains
- "China Plus One" strategy — multinationals diversifying manufacturing out of China
- Rare earth and critical mineral supply chain diversification

### Data and internet decoupling
- [[TikTok]] forced-sale bill (2024) — national security concerns over Chinese data access
- Clean Network initiative (Trump 1.0)
- China's Great Firewall already blocks US platforms

## The investment thesis

Decoupling creates winners and losers:

Winners:
- US/allied semiconductor companies ([[NVIDIA]], [[TSMC]], [[ASML]])
- Defense tech ([[Palantir]], [[Anduril]])
- Reshoring beneficiaries (US industrial, construction, power infrastructure)
- India, Vietnam, Mexico as manufacturing alternatives

Losers:
- Companies with deep China exposure (Apple, Qualcomm, Tesla China)
- Chinese tech companies cut off from US tools ([[Huawei]], [[SMIC]])
- Global companies caught in the middle (forced to choose sides)

## Institutional nexus

The [[Hill and Valley Forum]] is the primary private-sector venue where decoupling policy gets incubated. Key figures:
- [[Jacob Helberg]] — Under Secretary of State, architect of [[Pax Silica]]
- [[Peter Thiel]] — early China hawk, Palantir co-founder
- [[Todd Young]] — CHIPS Act co-author
- [[Lindsey Graham]] — defense hawk
