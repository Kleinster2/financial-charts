Frontier AI labs operate at extreme intensity — approaching China's infamous 9-9-6 (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week = 72 hours/week).

## The dynamic

Competition + scaling laws + leapfrogging = relentless pressure. Models one-up each other constantly. Labs must deliver or lose position.

**Anthropic** known for tight culture — everyone seems aligned, very little leaks. Culturally deep commitment.

**OpenAI** chaotic but lands things. "Very startup culture" chasing high-impact releases.

## Why it works (for now)

People at these companies want to do this work. Not forced — passionate. Similar to Apple's early days where engineers worked extreme hours on products they believed in.

Apple had "saving marriage" programs — code word for when someone needed to go home. People died from that level of work intensity.

## The burnout question

Human capital cost is real. "You can only do this for so long." Researchers burning out, especially those trying to be both manager and hands-on.

## Professors vs lab researchers

Professors seem happier on average than friends at frontier labs. Teaching, mentorship, mission-oriented work provides grounding that pure research grind doesn't.

## Cultural advantage

This intensity is an underrated driver of progress. Tight culture + competitive dynamic + belief in mission = people working hard and creating better things.
