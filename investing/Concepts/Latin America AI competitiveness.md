**Latin America AI competitiveness** — regional AI adoption lags despite $1.1-1.7T annual potential. Only 6% of organizations report meaningful EBIT impact. [[Productivity]] pivot critical as demographic dividend fades.

> **Key insight:** Latin America gets only 1.6% of global AI investment despite representing 6.3% of global GDP. The region's productivity has *contracted* -0.3% annually (2015-2024), with GDP growth driven almost entirely by workforce expansion—a model that won't survive as birth rates fall and populations age.

## Economic potential

**AI could add $1.1-1.7T annually to Latin America** (WEF/McKinsey, Jan 2026):

| Source | Annual value |
|--------|--------------|
| Analytical AI | $0.6-1.0T (~60%) |
| Generative AI | $0.5-0.7T (~40%) |
| **Total** | **$1.1-1.7T** |

This represents ~6% of global AI's estimated $17-26T annual potential.

**[[Productivity]] impact:** 1.9-2.3% annual productivity boost possible by 2030. For a region averaging -0.3% productivity growth, this would be transformational.

---

## Current adoption reality

**Headline:** Broad adoption, minimal value capture.

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Organizations generating any AI value | 23% | Most see no ROI |
| Organizations with >5% EBIT impact | **6%** | Meaningful impact rare |
| SMEs with zero AI value | 59% | SMEs left behind |
| AI strategy linked to business strategy | 10% | Misaligned execution |
| Leaders feel regulatory environment unclear | 58% | Governance gaps |

**Value capture by size:**

| Size | Positive EBIT impact | No impact |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Very large ($1B+) | 24% | 37% |
| Large ($100M-$1B) | 25% | 33% |
| SMEs (<$100M) | **18%** | **59%** |

SMEs are 99.5% of Latin American businesses. Their exclusion is a major drag on regional competitiveness.

## Where AI is actually deployed

### Analytical AI (at scale)

| Domain | At scale | Use cases |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Customer service | 27% | Behavioral routing, agent scheduling |
| Fraud/debt analytics | 22% | Fraud prediction, compliance |
| Personalization | 21% | Segmented retention, upsell |
| Digital marketing | 18% | Ad optimization, lead gen |

**Untapped:** IT automation (16%), people analytics (4%), procurement (3%).

### Generative AI (at scale)

| Domain | At scale | Use cases |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Software engineering | **22%** | Code generation, architecture docs |
| Customer service | 15% | Chatbots, call transcripts |
| Corporate IT | 12% | Internal tools |
| Personalization | 10% | Dynamic content |

**Untapped:** Manufacturing/supply chain (4%), talent analytics (4%), finance (2%).

## Why adoption isn't translating to value

WEF/McKinsey identified six dimensions of AI competitiveness. Latin America's biggest gaps vs global leaders:

| Dimension | LatAm avg | Global leaders | [[Gap]] |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Talent** | 23 | 52 | **29** |
| Adoption & scaling | 27 | 57 | 30 |
| Operating model | 30 | 56 | 26 |
| Data | 39 | 61 | 22 |
| Technology | 37 | 67 | 30 |
| Strategy | 37 | 64 | 27 |

**Talent is the widest gap.** Organizations struggle with:
- Role-based skill development
- Clear AI career paths
- Recruiting/retention vs multinationals
- Cross-functional collaboration

---

## The productivity imperative

**Latin America's historic growth model is broken:**

| Period | [[Productivity]] CAGR | Employment CAGR | GDP CAGR |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 2005-2014 | 1.9% | 1.4% | 3.2% |
| 2015-2024 | **-0.3%** | 1.2% | 0.9% |

Compare to world:
- Global productivity CAGR 2015-2024: **+1.3%**
- Latin America: **-0.3%**

**The demographic dividend is fading:** By 2053, 25%+ of Latin America's population will be 60+. Workforce expansion won't compensate for weak productivity.

---

## Infrastructure gaps

### Connectivity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Households without fixed broadband | 15-17% |
| Rural vs urban internet gap | **30+ percentage points** |
| Rural household internet access | 42% |
| Urban household internet access | 74% |

The urban-rural divide threatens AI as a democratizing force.

### Energy

[[Brazil]] advantage: **88% renewable electricity** (mostly hydro). Can power data centers cleanly *if* grid can connect generation to demand.

Challenges elsewhere:
- Colombia: Hydropower unreliable (droughts)
- Caribbean: Still relies on diesel/fuel oil
- [[Mexico]] ([[Querétaro]]): Public concern over data center water usage

## 10-point roadmap (WEF/McKinsey)

### Accelerate (immediate)
1. **Create sector-focused AI strategies** — agriculture, mining, energy, tourism
2. **Fuel AI sustainably** — expand renewables, grid connectivity
3. **Build universal connectivity** — [[5G]], last-mile solutions

### Expand
4. **Establish national data portals** — standardized, sector-segmented
5. **Adapt frontier AI to local needs** — fine-tune open-source with local data
6. **Develop AI literacy** — curricula at all education levels, credentialing standards

### Sustain
7. **Harmonize AI ethics/safety** — align with UNESCO, [[OECD]] frameworks
8. **Mobilize AI investment** — public-private funds, development bank anchoring
9. **Build AI innovation centers** — computing + research + training + incubation
10. **Foster regional collaboration** — shared infrastructure, knowledge transfer
