Nuclear is emerging as the preferred baseload power solution for AI data centers. Hyperscalers are signing deals, restarting plants, and funding SMRs.

## Why nuclear for AI

| Requirement | Why nuclear fits |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Baseload 24/7** | AI training runs continuously — can't use intermittent solar/wind |
| **Density** | 1GW plant on small footprint vs massive solar farms |
| **Carbon-free** | Hyperscalers have net-zero commitments |
| **Long-term contracts** | 20+ year PPAs match DC investment horizons |
| **Grid independence** | Co-location avoids grid bottlenecks |

## The deals (2024-2025)

| Company | Partner | Deal | Capacity |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| [[Microsoft]] | [[Constellation Energy]] | Three Mile Island restart | 835 MW |
| [[Amazon]] | [[Talen Energy]] | Susquehanna co-location | 960 MW |
| [[Google]] | Kairos Power | SMR development | 500 MW by 2030 |
| [[Oracle]] | TBD | Larry Ellison: "already got building permits" for nuclear DCs | 1 GW+ |

**Pattern:** Every major hyperscaler is pursuing nuclear. Not optional — it's table stakes.

## Three Mile Island restart

**The Microsoft-Constellation deal (Sep 2024):**
- Restart Unit 1 (shut down 2019 for economic reasons, not safety)
- 20-year PPA
- ~$1.6B refurbishment cost
- Target: 2028 restart
- First US nuclear restart in history

**Why it matters:**
- Proves "stranded" nuclear assets have value
- Sets template for other restarts
- Constellation stock +30% on announcement

---

## SMRs (Small Modular Reactors)

**The promise:**
- Factory-built, truck-shippable
- 50-300 MW per unit (vs 1GW+ traditional)
- Faster permitting, lower upfront cost
- Can co-locate directly with data centers

**The reality:**
- No commercial SMR operating in US yet
- NuScale canceled first project (2023) — cost overruns
- Timeline: late 2020s at earliest
- "SMR" becoming like "fusion" — always 10 years away?

**Key players:**
| Company | Status | Backers |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [[Oklo]] | Pre-revenue, Aurora design | [[Sam Altman]] (chairman) |
| [[NuScale]] | Canceled first project, pivoting | Public (SMR) |
| Kairos Power | Google deal, molten salt design | Google, DOE |
| TerraPower | Natrium design, Wyoming site | Bill Gates |
| [[X-energy]] | Xe-100 design | DOE, Dow Chemical |

## Uranium supply chain

If nuclear scales for AI, uranium demand increases:

| Company | Role | Ticker |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[Cameco]] | Largest Western uranium miner | CCJ |
| Kazatomprom | Largest global producer (Kazakhstan) | KAP |
| [[Centrus Energy]] | US enrichment, HALEU for SMRs | LEU |
| [[Uranium Energy Corp]] | US mining | UEC |
| [[Energy Fuels]] | US uranium + rare earth processing | UUUU |

**HALEU bottleneck:** Advanced SMRs need High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium. Only Centrus produces it in US. Russia was main supplier — now sanctioned.

## Nuclear vs alternatives

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Nuclear** | Baseload, dense, carbon-free | Slow to build, capex heavy, regulatory |
| **Natural gas** | Fast to build, dispatchable | Carbon, fuel price volatility |
| **Solar/wind** | Cheap, scalable | Intermittent, needs storage |
| **Batteries** | Pairs with renewables | Duration limits, cost |
| **Geothermal** | Baseload, small footprint | Limited locations |

**Hyperscaler calculus:** Nuclear for baseload + renewables for incremental + gas for backup.

---

## Regulatory tailwinds

- **NRC reform discussions** — streamlining approvals
- **ADVANCE Act (2024)** — supports advanced reactor licensing
- **DOE loan programs** — backing SMR development
- **State support** — some states reversing nuclear phase-outs

But still slow. A new nuclear plant takes 10-15 years in US. Restarts are faster (3-5 years).

---

## Investment implications

**Direct plays:**
- [[Constellation Energy]] — largest nuclear fleet, hyperscaler deals
- [[Vistra]] — nuclear + gas, Texas exposure
- [[Cameco]] — uranium if nuclear scales
- [[Centrus Energy]] — HALEU monopoly for SMRs

**Speculative:**
- [[Oklo]] — Altman-backed, pre-revenue
- NuScale — struggling but only public pure-play SMR

**Indirect beneficiaries:**
- Hyperscalers with nuclear PPAs have power advantage
- Data center REITs near nuclear plants

---

## Risks

- SMRs may not deliver on cost/timeline
- Nuclear restarts face local opposition
- Uranium supply constraints
- Regulatory could tighten (accidents, politics)
- Natural gas may remain cheaper near-term

---

## For theses

**Cross-cutting:**
- [[Power constraints]] — nuclear is primary solution to 44GW gap
- [[AI hyperscalers]] — nuclear PPAs becoming competitive moat
- All AI chip theses indirectly depend on power availability

**New potential thesis:** Long nuclear as AI power enabler

## Fusion: The long shot

**Not to be confused with fission.** Fusion is far more speculative:

| | Fission | Fusion |
|---|---|---|
| **Works today?** | Yes (450+ reactors globally) | No (commercially) |
| **Timeline** | Now (restarts) to 2030s (SMRs) | 2030s+ (if ever) |
| **Risk** | Regulatory, cost, execution | Technical feasibility |
| **AI relevance** | High (near-term) | Low (too far out) |

**Fusion players:**
- [[Helion Energy]] — Altman-backed, Microsoft PPA, most credible
- [[TAE Technologies]] — TMTG merger, hydrogen-boron
- Commonwealth Fusion Systems — MIT spinout, tokamak
- Helion — Altman invested, pulsed fusion

**Bottom line:** Fusion is not a solution for AI power in the 2025-2030 window. It's a 2030s+ lottery ticket.
