Nuclear is emerging as the preferred baseload power solution for AI data centers. Hyperscalers are signing deals, restarting plants, and funding SMRs.

## Why nuclear for AI

| Requirement | Why nuclear fits |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Baseload 24/7** | AI training runs continuously — can't use intermittent solar/wind |
| **Density** | 1GW plant on small footprint vs massive solar farms |
| **Carbon-free** | Hyperscalers have net-zero commitments |
| **Long-term contracts** | 20+ year PPAs match DC investment horizons |
| **Grid independence** | Co-location avoids grid bottlenecks |

## The deals (2024-2026)

| Company | Partner | Deal | Capacity |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| [[Microsoft]] | [[Constellation Energy]] | Three Mile Island restart | 835 MW |
| [[Amazon]] | [[Talen Energy]] | [[Susquehanna]] co-location | 960 MW |
| [[Google]] | [[Kairos Power]] | SMR development | 500 MW by 2030 |
| [[Oracle]] | TBD | [[Larry Ellison]]: "already got building permits" for nuclear DCs | 1 GW+ |
| [[Meta]] | [[Vistra]] | 20-year PPA, 3 OH/PA plants | **2.6 GW** |
| [[Meta]] | [[TerraPower]] | Advanced reactor partnership | TBD |
| [[Meta]] | [[Oklo]] | SMR deal | TBD |
| [[Meta]] | [[Constellation Energy]] | $10B Louisiana DC | TBD |

**Meta total:** Up to **6.6 GW** of nuclear capacity by 2035 — one of the largest corporate nuclear buyers in US history.

**Pattern:** Every major hyperscaler is pursuing nuclear. Not optional — it's table stakes.

## DOE investment (Feb 2026)

**$2.7B awarded for domestic enriched uranium** — historic investment in nuclear fuel capacity.

Addresses HALEU bottleneck for advanced SMRs.

---

## China SMR leadership

**Linglong One** (CNNC):
- World's first commercial onshore SMR
- On track for **H1 2026** commercial operations
- Located in Hainan

China moving ahead while US SMR projects face delays.

---

## Three Mile Island restart

**The Microsoft-Constellation deal (Sep 2024):**
- Restart Unit 1 (shut down 2019 for economic reasons, not safety)
- 20-year PPA
- ~$1.6B refurbishment cost
- [[Target]]: 2028 restart
- First US nuclear restart in history

**Why it matters:**
- Proves "stranded" nuclear assets have value
- Sets template for other restarts
- Constellation stock +30% on announcement

---

## SMRs (Small Modular Reactors)

**The promise:**
- Factory-built, truck-shippable
- 50-300 MW per unit (vs 1GW+ traditional)
- Faster permitting, lower upfront cost
- Can co-locate directly with data centers

**The reality:**
- No commercial SMR operating in US yet
- NuScale canceled first project (2023) — cost overruns
- Timeline: late 2020s at earliest
- "SMR" becoming like "fusion" — always 10 years away?

**Key players:**
| Company | Status | Backers |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [[Oklo]] | Pre-revenue, [[Aurora]] design | [[Sam Altman]] (chairman) |
| [[NuScale]] | Canceled first project, pivoting | Public (SMR) |
| [[Kairos Power]] | Google deal, molten salt design | Google, DOE |
| [[TerraPower]] | Natrium design, Wyoming site | [[Bill Gates]] |
| [[X-energy]] | Xe-100 design | DOE, Dow Chemical |

## [[Uranium]] supply chain

If nuclear scales for AI, uranium demand increases:

| Company | Role | Ticker |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[Cameco]] | Largest Western uranium miner | CCJ |
| [[Kazatomprom]] | Largest global producer (Kazakhstan) | KAP |
| [[Centrus Energy]] | US enrichment, HALEU for SMRs | LEU |
| [[Uranium Energy Corp]] | US mining | UEC |
| [[Energy Fuels]] | US uranium + rare earth processing | UUUU |

**HALEU bottleneck:** Advanced SMRs need High-Assay Low-Enriched [[Uranium]]. Only Centrus produces it in US. [[Russia]] was main supplier — now sanctioned.

---

## Nuclear vs alternatives

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Nuclear** | Baseload, dense, carbon-free | Slow to build, capex heavy, regulatory |
| **[[Natural gas]]** | Fast to build, dispatchable | Carbon, fuel price volatility |
| **Solar/wind** | Cheap, scalable | Intermittent, needs storage |
| **[[Batteries]]** | Pairs with renewables | Duration limits, cost |
| **Geothermal** | Baseload, small footprint | Limited locations |

**Hyperscaler calculus:** Nuclear for baseload + renewables for incremental + gas for backup.

### Gas-nuclear LCOE convergence (Feb 2026)

The gas cost advantage that historically made nuclear a harder sell is disappearing. US gas-fired LCOE jumped **48% in H2 2025 YoY** (Bloomberg NEF). Turbine backlogs at [[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]], and [[Mitsubishi]] now exceed 4 years.

[[SoftBank]]'s proposed 9.2 GW Ohio gas plant: all-in delivered cost ~$100/MWh (LCOE $75-80 + transmission $15-20) — essentially the same as nuclear PPAs in the [[PJM]] region. When gas is priced like nuclear, nuclear's zero-carbon advantage and decades-long operational life make it relatively more attractive. Strengthens the case for nuclear restarts and new builds.

## Regulatory tailwinds

- **NRC reform discussions** — streamlining approvals
- **ADVANCE Act (2024)** — supports advanced reactor licensing
- **DOE loan programs** — backing SMR development
- **State support** — some states reversing nuclear phase-outs

But still slow. A new nuclear plant takes 10-15 years in US. Restarts are faster (3-5 years).

## Investment implications

**Direct plays:**
- [[Constellation Energy]] — largest nuclear fleet, hyperscaler deals
- [[Vistra]] — nuclear + gas, Texas exposure
- [[Cameco]] — uranium if nuclear scales
- [[Centrus Energy]] — HALEU monopoly for SMRs

**Speculative:**
- [[Oklo]] — Altman-backed, pre-revenue
- NuScale — struggling but only public pure-play SMR
- [[Fermi]] — 11GW nuclear+gas campus REIT, zero revenue, class action

**Indirect beneficiaries:**
- Hyperscalers with nuclear PPAs have power advantage
- Data center [[REITs]] near nuclear plants

---

## Risks

- SMRs may not deliver on cost/timeline
- Nuclear restarts face local opposition
- [[Uranium]] supply constraints
- Regulatory could tighten (accidents, politics)
- [[Natural gas]] may remain cheaper near-term

---

## For theses

**Cross-cutting:**
- [[Power constraints]] — nuclear is primary solution to 44GW gap
- [[AI hyperscalers]] — nuclear PPAs becoming competitive moat
- All AI chip theses indirectly depend on power availability

**New potential thesis:** [[Long nuclear]] as AI power enabler

## Fusion: The long shot

**Not to be confused with fission.** Fusion is far more speculative:

| | Fission | Fusion |
|---|---|---|
| **Works today?** | Yes (450+ reactors globally) | No (commercially) |
| **Timeline** | Now (restarts) to 2030s (SMRs) | 2030s+ (if ever) |
| **Risk** | Regulatory, cost, execution | Technical feasibility |
| **AI relevance** | High (near-term) | Low (too far out) |

**Fusion players:**
- [[Helion Energy]] — Altman-backed, Microsoft PPA, most credible
- [[TAE Technologies]] — TMTG merger, hydrogen-boron
- [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] — MIT spinout, tokamak
- Helion — Altman invested, pulsed fusion

**Bottom line:** Fusion is not a solution for AI power in the 2025-2030 window. It's a 2030s+ lottery ticket.
