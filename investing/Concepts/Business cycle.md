## Cycle phases

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Early recovery** | GDP bottoming, rates low, unemployment high |
| **Expansion** | GDP growing, hiring increasing, confidence rising |
| **Late cycle** | GDP slowing, inflation rising, rates peaking |
| **Recession** | GDP contracting, layoffs, fear |

---

## Phase indicators

| Phase | Leading signals |
|-------|-----------------|
| Early recovery | Yield curve steepening, PMI bottoming |
| Expansion | Credit growth, capex rising |
| Late cycle | Yield curve flat/inverted, wage inflation |
| Recession | PMI < 50, jobless claims rising |

---

## Sector rotation

| Phase | Outperformers |
|-------|---------------|
| Early recovery | Financials, consumer discretionary |
| Expansion | Tech, industrials |
| Late cycle | Energy, materials |
| Recession | Utilities, healthcare, staples |

## Asset class performance

|-------|----------------|
| Early recovery | Stocks, high yield bonds |
| Expansion | Stocks, commodities |
| Late cycle | [[Commodities]], cash |
| Recession | [[Treasuries]], gold |

## Key indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **GDP growth** | Output measure |
| **PMI** | Manufacturing/services health |
| **Unemployment** | Labor market |
| **Yield curve** | Rate expectations |
| **LEI** | Composite leading indicator |
| **[[Consumer]] confidence** | Sentiment |

## Cycle length (historical)

| Metric | US average |
|--------|------------|
| Expansion length | ~6 years |
| Recession length | ~11 months |
| Full cycle | ~7 years |

Post-2008 expansion was unusually long (11 years).

## Theoretical frameworks

| Theory | Key driver | Policy implication |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Keynesian** | Demand shortfalls | Fiscal/monetary stimulus |
| **Monetarist** | Money supply changes | Stable money growth |
| **[[Real Business Cycle theory]]** | [[Productivity]]/technology shocks | Limited policy role |
| **New Keynesian** | Demand + sticky prices | Active monetary policy |

**Modern view:** Cycles likely driven by mix of demand and supply factors. [[Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward Prescott]] won the 2004 Nobel Prize for showing that real (supply-side) shocks can explain significant cycle variation.

## Investment implications

| Add cyclicals | Early recovery |
| Full equity | Expansion |
| Reduce risk | Late cycle |
| Add defensives | Pre-recession |
| Buy dip | Mid-recession |
