Trade secrets can leak via analog methods that bypass digital controls. Hardware [[Export controls]] don't stop knowledge transfer.

## The Samsung-CXMT case (Dec 2025)

- Samsung engineer leaked DRAM process secrets to CXMT (China)
- **Method**: Handwritten notes — bypassed all digital surveillance
- **Scope**: 600+ process steps, specific gas ratios, pressures, photoresist parameters
- **Value**: 5 years and 1.6T KRW of Samsung R&D
- **Result**: CXMT can skip trial-and-error, calibrate directly

## Why it matters

| Control type | Effectiveness |
|--------------|---------------|
| Equipment export bans | High — hardware is physical |
| Digital security | Medium — can monitor, but determined actors find gaps |
| Knowledge transfer | Low — humans carry knowledge, analog methods work |

The U.S. can ban EUV machines to China. It cannot ban notebooks.

## Who's vulnerable

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Samsung]] | Proven — DRAM secrets leaked |
| [[SK Hynix]] | High — similar China operations, similar risk |
| [[TSMC]] | Medium — less China exposure, but Taiwan-based employees |
| [[Intel Foundry Services]] | Lower — U.S.-based, but still hires globally |

---

## Implications

- [[Export controls]] are necessary but not sufficient
- Process knowledge is the real moat — and it's leakable
- China can progress faster than equipment bans suggest
- Memory commoditization may accelerate as Chinese fabs catch up

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

**Mixed signal:**
- Bearish Korea: Samsung's memory IP advantage weakened
- Bearish Korea: SK Hynix likely has similar vulnerabilities
- But: Affects all players with process secrets, not just Korea
- Doesn't change foundry/packaging dynamics directly
