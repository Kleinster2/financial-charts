# Stock-Bond Correlation Regime

The relationship between equity and sovereign bond returns — the single most important input for multi-asset portfolio construction. When stocks and bonds are negatively correlated, bonds hedge equity drawdowns (the 60/40 premise). When positively correlated, diversification breaks down.

## The regime shift

Two decades of negative correlation ended around 2020. The trend lines tell the story:

- 2000-2020: US correlation trend ranged from -0.2 to -0.4 — bonds reliably hedged equity risk
- Post-2020: US trend crossed zero ~2022, now ~+0.25 and rising
- G4 trend is worse — surging toward +0.55 by 2025
- 3-month rolling correlation whips between -0.6 and +0.4, making short-term hedging unreliable

## Why it shifted

The pre-2020 negative correlation was a product of the low-inflation, demand-shock-dominated era. Central banks could cut rates into equity selloffs, pushing bond prices up. That mechanism breaks when:

1. Inflation is the dominant risk (supply shocks) — both stocks and bonds fall together
2. Fiscal dominance — governments issue so much debt that bond supply overwhelms demand ([[Lyn Alden]]'s framework)
3. Financial repression — central banks hold rates below inflation, making bonds structurally unattractive ([[Russell Napier]]'s thesis)
4. Term premium repricing — investors demand more compensation for duration risk

The last sustained period of positive stock-bond correlation was the 1970s-1990s — also an era of high/volatile inflation.

## Investment implications

The correlation regime determines what "diversification" actually means:

| Regime | Correlation | Bonds hedge equities? | 60/40 works? | Era |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|-----|
| Demand-shock dominated | Negative | Yes | Yes | 2000-2020 |
| Inflation/supply dominated | Positive | No | No | 1970s-1990s, 2022+ |

When bonds stop hedging, investors search for alternatives:
- [[Private credit]] — pitched as "bond replacement" to retail (the sell that enabled the BDC boom)
- Real assets — commodities, infrastructure, real estate
- Trend-following / managed futures — one of few strategies that profit from positive correlation regimes
- Gold — historically works in both regimes

## Who thinks about this

- [[Russell Napier]] — financial repression thesis predicts sustained positive correlation
- [[Lyn Alden]] — fiscal dominance framework: governments inflate away debt, breaking the bond hedge
- [[Jim Bianco]] — called the bond bear market, argues correlation shift is structural
- [[Mohamed El-Erian]] — warned about the "new normal" eroding portfolio assumptions
- [[AQR]] — published extensively on correlation regimes and portfolio construction
- [[Bridgewater]] — [[Ray Dalio]]'s All Weather portfolio was built for regime changes
