Equipment for attaching and stacking semiconductor dies — the critical manufacturing step that turns individual chips into functional packages. The HBM boom has made this a $5B+ market with intense competition between European and Asian suppliers.

## Why it matters

Modern chips aren't single dies — they're stacked assemblies:
- **HBM**: 8-16 memory dies stacked vertically
- **AI accelerators**: Logic + HBM integrated on interposer
- **Chiplets**: Multiple dies in one package

The bonding equipment determines yield, throughput, and whether advanced packaging is even possible at scale.

## Technology landscape

| Technology | Description | Precision | Use case |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **TC bonding** | Thermal compression with solder bumps | ~10μm | HBM3/3E current production |
| **Hybrid bonding** | Direct Cu-Cu fusion, no solder | <1μm | HBM4E, advanced logic, future |
| **Die attach** | Placing dies on substrates | Various | Broad semiconductor packaging |
| **Wire bonding** | Gold/copper wire connections | Legacy | Mature nodes, cost-sensitive |

**The transition:** HBM3/3E uses TC bonding. HBM4 can still use TC (with MR-MUF process), but HBM4E and beyond will require hybrid bonding for tighter pitch and 16+ layer stacks.

## Competitive landscape

| Company | HQ | Strength | Weakness | Stock |
|---------|-----|----------|----------|-------|
| [[BE Semiconductor Industries\|BESI]] | Netherlands | Hybrid bonding leader (100nm→50nm precision) | Smaller scale | BESI.AS |
| [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] | Korea | 90%+ HBM3E TC bonder share | Behind on hybrid bonding | 042700.KS |
| [[ASMPT]] | Hong Kong | Diversified, gaining SK Hynix share | Margin collapse, no tech lead | 0522.HK |
| [[Applied Materials]] | US | Broader ecosystem, 9% BESI stake | Not pure-play bonding | AMAT |

### Stock performance since 2020

| Company | Return | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] | **+4,900%** | HBM3E dominance, but peaking |
| [[BE Semiconductor Industries\|BESI]] | **+500%** | Hybrid bonding optionality |
| [[ASMPT]] | **-5%** | Diversified but undifferentiated |

Hanmi massively outperformed but faces share erosion. BESI is the technology leader. ASMPT is the cautionary tale of winning orders without winning margins.

## Customer dynamics

### SK Hynix (HBM #1)

| Supplier | Trend |
|----------|-------|
| [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] | Was sole supplier → falling to 20-30% by 2026 |
| [[ASMPT]] | Gaining share (~50% of HBM4 TC bonders) |
| [[BE Semiconductor Industries\|BESI]] | Hybrid bonding orders for HBM4E |

SK Hynix is actively diversifying away from Hanmi, accelerated by Hanmi-Hanwha patent dispute.

### Micron (HBM #3)

- Currently uses Hanmi + Shinkawa for TC bonding
- Expected to switch to **BESI exclusively** for HBM4
- Validates BESI's technology lead

### Samsung (HBM #2)

- Internal packaging capabilities
- Less dependent on external equipment

## Technology transition timeline

| Period | Technology | Equipment winner |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| 2023-2025 | TC bonding (HBM3/3E) | [[Hanmi Semiconductor]] |
| 2025-2026 | TC + early hybrid (HBM4) | Transition period |
| 2027+ | Hybrid bonding (HBM4E+) | [[BE Semiconductor Industries\|BESI]] positioned to win |

**Key risk for Hanmi:** The technology transition is existential. If hybrid bonding becomes standard and Hanmi can't catch up, their 90%+ share becomes worthless.

## Market sizing

| Year | Market size | Driver |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2024 | ~$500M | HBM3E ramp |
| 2026 | ~$1B+ | HBM4 volume production |
| 2028 | **$2B+** | Hybrid bonding at 50% HBM penetration |

Hybrid bonders cost ~₩4B (~$3M) each — significantly more than TC bonders.

## Investment implications

**The BESI thesis:** Technology transitions create winners and losers. BESI's hybrid bonding lead (100nm accuracy, Gen 2 at 50nm) positions it to capture share as the industry shifts. [[Applied Materials]]'s 9% stake validates the technology.

**The Hanmi risk:** Current dominance (90%+ HBM3E share) masks vulnerability. If hybrid bonding adoption accelerates, Hanmi's TC bonder expertise becomes less valuable. They're developing hybrid bonders but are 1-2 years behind BESI.

**The ASMPT lesson:** Gaining market share isn't enough — you need profitable share. ASMPT is winning SK Hynix orders but margins have collapsed. Being the "safe second choice" doesn't create value.
