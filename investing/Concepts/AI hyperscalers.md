AI hyperscalers are the demand side of the semiconductor supply chain — they consume the chips that foundries, memory companies, and OSATs produce.

---

## Why they matter

Hyperscaler capex = demand signal for the whole stack:

```
Hyperscaler $ → NVIDIA/AMD → TSMC/Samsung → SK Hynix (HBM) → ASE (packaging) → Cohu (test)
```

**Quarterly capex trajectory (Q3 2025):**

| Hyperscaler | Q3 2019 | Q3 2025 | Multiple |
|-------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **AMZN** | $4.7B | $35.1B | **7.5x** |
| **GOOG** | $6.7B | $24.0B | **3.6x** |
| **META** | $3.5B | $18.8B | **5.4x** |
| **MSFT** | $3.4B | $19.4B | **5.7x** |
| **Total** | $18.3B | **$97.3B** | **5.3x** |

*Annualized Q3 2025 run rate: ~$390B*

**2025 context:**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Big 4 capex (annualized) | **~$390B** |
| Global AI VC (YTD Oct) | **$193B** (record) |
| China AI capex | $98B (+48% YoY) |

## The players

| Tier | Player | Foundry exposure | Notes |
|------|--------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | [[Microsoft]] | [[TSMC]] | OpenAI partner, largest spender |
| 1 | [[Google]] | [[TSMC]] | TPUs, Broadcom disintermediation |
| 1 | [[Amazon]] | [[TSMC]] | Trainium/Inferentia custom silicon |
| 1 | [[Meta]] | [[TSMC]] | Heavy NVIDIA buyer, Llama |
| 2 | [[Anthropic]] | [[TSMC]] | TPU route, not NVIDIA |
| 2 | [[xAI]] | [[Samsung]]? | Musk ecosystem, potential anchor |
| 2 | [[Oracle]] | [[TSMC]] | GPU cloud, NVIDIA partner |
| 2 | [[Tesla]] | [[Samsung]] | Dojo, $16.5B deal |

See individual actor notes for details.

## Key dynamics

**TSMC concentration**: Most hyperscalers depend on TSMC. Limited alternatives if Taiwan risk materializes.

**Samsung opportunity**: Musk ecosystem ([[Tesla]] + [[xAI]]) is the beachhead. [[AMD]] 2nm deal could bring others.

**[[Power constraints]]**: 44GW US shortfall. May slow chip deployment even if supply exists. BYOP (Bring Your Own Power) emerging.

**Enabler vs hyperscaler**: [[Broadcom]] designs chips for hyperscalers but isn't one. Sits between hyperscalers and foundries.

## For theses

- [[Long TSMC]] — hyperscaler demand locks TSMC capacity
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — Musk ecosystem anchoring Samsung
- [[Long memory]] — every GPU needs HBM
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — more chips = more test/packaging
