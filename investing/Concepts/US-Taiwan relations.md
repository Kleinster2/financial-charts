**US-Taiwan relations** — Unofficial but substantive. The US does not formally recognize Taiwan but maintains deep economic, defense, and political ties under the Taiwan Relations Act framework.

---

## Legal framework

### Taiwan Relations Act (1979)

Passed after US switched recognition to PRC. Key provisions:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| [[Defense]] articles | US provides weapons for Taiwan's defense |
| "Grave concern" | US would treat force against Taiwan as serious matter |
| No recognition | US doesn't recognize ROC government |
| People-to-people | Maintains unofficial relations via AIT |

**Strategic ambiguity:** TRA doesn't commit US to defend Taiwan, but doesn't rule it out.

### Six Assurances (1982)

Reagan's private commitments to Taiwan:

1. No date for ending arms sales
2. No consultation with PRC on arms sales
3. No mediation between Taipei and Beijing
4. No revision of TRA
5. No change in sovereignty position
6. No pressure on Taiwan to negotiate with PRC

Made public 2020; codified by Congress.

### One [[China]] policy (US version)

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Acknowledges | PRC position that Taiwan is part of [[China]] |
| Does not accept | PRC sovereignty claim |
| Opposes | Unilateral changes to status quo by either side |
| Based on | Three Joint Communiqués + TRA + Six Assurances |

**Note:** US "One [[China]] policy" ≠ PRC "One [[China]] principle" — critical distinction.

## [[Defense]] cooperation

### Arms sales

| Package | Year | Value | Key items |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| F-16V upgrade | 2019 | $8B | 66 fighters |
| Harpoon missiles | 2020 | $2.4B | 400 coastal defense |
| HIMARS | 2020 | $436M | 11 systems |
| M1A2 tanks | 2019 | $2B | 108 tanks |
| Abrams + Stingers | 2023 | $500M | Drawdown authority |

**Annual average:** ~$1-2B in recent years; increasing.

### Training and exercises

| Activity | Status |
|----------|--------|
| US troops in Taiwan | Small number (~30), training role |
| Joint exercises | Informal, unannounced |
| National Guard partnerships | Michigan, Hawaii |
| Officer exchanges | Ongoing |

### Unofficial commitments

**Biden's statements (2021-2024):** Four times stated US would defend Taiwan militarily — each time walked back by staff as "policy unchanged."

**Interpretation:** Strategic ambiguity eroding toward strategic clarity.
