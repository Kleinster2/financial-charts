# Risk-on risk-off

The dominant framework for understanding how capital flows between asset classes based on aggregate risk appetite. When sentiment is positive (risk-on), capital flows to growth assets; when fear dominates (risk-off), capital seeks safety.

## Asset behavior by regime

| Asset class       | Risk-on            | Risk-off           |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Equities          | Rally              | Sell               |
| [[Treasuries|US Treasuries]]     | Sell (yields rise) | Rally (yields fall)|
| USD               | Weaken             | Strengthen         |
| JPY               | Weaken             | Strengthen         |
| Gold              | Mixed              | Rally              |
| EM assets         | Rally              | Sell               |
| High-yield credit | Tighten            | Widen              |
| AUD, commodity FX | Rally              | Sell               |

**Key insight:** In normal risk-off, [[Treasuries|US Treasuries]] and USD are the destination. The [[Sell America trade]] is when even those safe havens get sold—a distinct, more severe phenomenon.

## What drives regime shifts

**Risk-on catalysts:**
- Central bank easing / dovish pivot
- Strong economic data
- Earnings beats
- Geopolitical de-escalation
- Fiscal stimulus

**Risk-off catalysts:**
- Central bank hawkishness
- Recession signals
- Geopolitical shocks (wars, sanctions)
- Credit events / defaults
- Policy uncertainty (tariffs, elections)

## Key indicators

### Volatility

**[[VIX]]** — the primary fear gauge. Measures 30-day implied volatility on S&P 500 options.

| VIX level | Interpretation                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| < 15      | Complacent, risk-on                   |
| 15-20     | Normal, healthy                       |
| 20-30     | Elevated uncertainty                  |
| > 30      | High fear, risk-off                   |
| > 50      | Crisis (2008, COVID, April 2025 tariffs) |

**MOVE Index** — Treasury volatility equivalent. When MOVE spikes while VIX is calm, bond-specific stress.

### Credit

**[[Credit spreads]]** — the spread between corporate bonds and Treasuries. Widening = risk-off.

| Spread        | Typical range | Risk-off signal |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| HY OAS        | 3-5%          | > 5%            |
| IG OAS        | 0.8-1.5%      | > 2%            |
| HY minus IG   | 2-3%          | > 4%            |

As of late 2024/early 2025, HY spreads at ~2.5-2.8% were near historic tights—signaling extreme risk-on/complacency.

### Currencies

**JPY strength** — yen rallies in risk-off as carry trades unwind. AUD/JPY is a classic sentiment pair: rises in risk-on, falls in risk-off.

**DXY** — dollar typically strengthens in risk-off (safe haven). Exception: [[Sell America trade]].

### Other

- **Put/call ratio** — high = hedging demand, risk-off
- **TED spread** — LIBOR minus T-bill, measures interbank stress
- **Gold** — rallies in risk-off, but also inflation hedge

## 2025 context

April 2025 tariff shock produced VIX > 50, a level seen only in major crises. It dropped from 50 to < 20 in under 100 days—one of only four such rapid declines in history.

Credit spreads widened from historic tights but remained contained relative to past crises, suggesting confidence in corporate fundamentals despite policy chaos.

June 2025 Israel-Iran escalation was textbook risk-off: gold surged past $3,500, AUD/JPY plunged, equities sold.

## Using the framework

**Confirmation:** Multiple indicators moving together strengthens the signal. VIX spiking while credit spreads widen and JPY rallies = confirmed risk-off.

**Divergence:** When indicators disagree, dig deeper. VIX elevated but spreads tight could mean equity-specific fear, not broad risk-off.

**Regime persistence:** Risk-off episodes are typically shorter than risk-on. After VIX > 47, markets positive 100% of the time over next 360 days (avg +35.3% since 1990).
