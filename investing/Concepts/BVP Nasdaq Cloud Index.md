## As AI disruption proxy

EMCLOUD is closer to pure AI disruption exposure than [[IGV]] because:

- Focused on **SaaS companies** (subscription software) — the business model most directly threatened by AI agents that can replace per-seat workflows
- Excludes hardware, infrastructure, and platform companies that benefit from AI
- Skews toward mid-cap cloud names that lack the moats of Microsoft/Oracle

But it's still not curated for disruption — it includes cloud infrastructure and dev tools alongside workflow SaaS.
