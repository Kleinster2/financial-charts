# Carry trade

Borrow in a low-yield currency, invest in high-yield assets, pocket the spread. The trade works until it doesn't—unwinds are violent because leverage and crowding create reflexive feedback loops.

## How it works

1. Borrow in low-yield currency (JPY at ~0%, CHF)
2. Convert to high-yield currency (AUD, MXN, BRL, EM)
3. Invest in high-yield assets (bonds, equities)
4. Earn yield differential
5. Repay loan, keep spread—if FX cooperates

## Classic pairs

| Funding | Target | Typical spread |
| ------- | ------ | -------------- |
| JPY     | AUD    | +4%            |
| JPY     | MXN    | +10%           |
| CHF     | ZAR    | +7%            |
| EUR     | BRL    | +9%            |

## Why it unwinds violently

**Leverage:** Most carry traders use FX forwards/futures to amplify returns. When the trade reverses, margin calls force liquidation.

**Crowding:** When everyone exits simultaneously, the funding currency spikes, creating a reflexive loop—more appreciation → more forced selling → more appreciation.

**Double loss:** You lose on the yield position AND on the FX move. A 5% yen rally can wipe out years of carry.

## August 2024: the textbook unwind

The defining modern example. Estimated ~¥40 trillion ($250B) in yen carry going into the event.

**Triggers:**
- **July 31:** BOJ unexpectedly raised rates from 0.1% to 0.25%
- **Aug 2:** Weak US jobs report (114K vs 175K expected) → Fed cut speculation → yield differential compression

**The unwind:**
- JPY appreciated 6.15% in one week (July 29 – Aug 5)
- **Nikkei:** -12.4% on Aug 5, worst since 1987
- **S&P 500:** -3% same day
- MXN, BRL, ZAR hit hardest among target currencies
- CNH (offshore yuan) also caught in unwind—unusual

**Scale:** JP Morgan estimated ~50% of carry trade unwound by Aug 9.

**Recovery:** Nikkei rallied 10% the next day after BOJ signaled no further hikes imminent.

## When carry works

- **Low [[VIX]]** — stable FX, no surprise unwinds
- **Predictable central banks** — no sudden rate moves
- **Risk-on sentiment** — positioning builds gradually
- **Wide yield differential** — enough spread to compensate FX risk

## Warning signals

| Signal              | Interpretation                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [[VIX]] spike       | Risk-off, unwind risk rising       |
| JPY strengthening   | Unwind potentially in progress     |
| BOJ hawkish shift   | Funding cost rising                |
| EM stress           | Target currencies vulnerable       |
| Weak US data        | Fed cuts narrow yield differential |

## December 2025: BOJ hikes again

BOJ raised rates to 0.5%—highest in 30 years. 30-year JGB yields hit record highs. The carry trade remains a structural risk as Japan slowly normalizes policy.
