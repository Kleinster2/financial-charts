## The thesis

Fastest-growing digital region:

| Country | Population | Tech Strategy |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| [[Singapore Tech]] | 6M | Hub, SWFs |
| [[Indonesia Tech]] | 275M | Scale, super-apps |
| [[Vietnam Tech]] | 100M | Manufacturing |
| [[Malaysia Tech]] | 34M | OSAT/packaging |
| [[Thailand Tech]] | 70M | [[Automotive]] |
| [[Philippines Tech]] | 115M | BPO |

Combined: 600M+ people.

---

## Differentiated strategies

| Country | Niche |
|---------|-------|
| Singapore | Regional HQ, finance |
| Indonesia | [[Consumer]] scale |
| Vietnam | Electronics manufacturing |
| Malaysia | Semiconductor backend |
| Thailand | [[Automotive]], HDD |
| Philippines | Services, BPO |

Each has distinct positioning.

---

## Super-app battle

**Regional champions:**

| Company | HQ | Strength |
|---------|-----|----------|
| [[Grab]] | Singapore | Ride-hailing |
| [[Sea Group]] | Singapore | E-commerce, gaming |
| [[GoTo]] | Indonesia | Indonesia depth |

Singapore-based dominate regionally.

---

## Manufacturing shift

**[[China+1]] beneficiaries:**

| Country | Attracting |
|---------|------------|
| Vietnam | Electronics ([[Samsung]], [[Intel]]) |
| Malaysia | [[Semiconductors]] ([[Intel]], [[AMD]]) |
| Indonesia | Growing interest |
| Thailand | EV production |

Vietnam = biggest winner.

---

## Semiconductor presence

| Country | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| Malaysia | Backend (50+ years) |
| Vietnam | Assembly, growing design |
| Singapore | [[GlobalFoundries]] fab |
| Philippines | Some backend |

Malaysia = [[ASEAN]] semiconductor leader.

---

## Hyperscaler investment

**Data center buildout:**

| Country | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Singapore | All hyperscalers, mature |
| Indonesia | All hyperscalers, growing |
| Malaysia | [[Google]], [[Microsoft]] ($2B+ each) |
| Thailand | [[Google]] Cloud 2024 |
| Vietnam | Growing interest |

Every country getting DC investment.

---

## Chinese DC buildout (post-[[DeepSeek]])

**New pattern:** Chinese tech firms building data centers directly in SEA instead of importing chips to mainland [[China]].

| Company | SEA Activity |
|---------|--------------|
| [[ByteDance]] | DCs in Malaysia, Singapore |
| [[Alibaba]] | Expanding SEA cloud presence |
| [[Tencent]] | Regional DC expansion |
| Others | Dozens of Chinese-built DCs |

**Why SEA:**
- Chips stay "in SEA" technically — not classified as [[China]] import
- SEA governments welcome investment
- Avoids export control scrutiny
- Lower regulatory friction than mainland

**Scale of chip flows (Jan-Oct 2025):**

| Country | [[Taiwan]] chip imports |
|---------|---------------------|
| Malaysia | $12B |
| Singapore | $7B |
| Thailand | $3B |
| Indonesia | $1.2B |
| **Total** | **$23B** |

**The question:** Does SEA's legitimate AI demand justify $23B in imports? Or is this [[SEA chip diversion]]?

**Geopolitical complexity:**
- [[ASEAN]] countries benefit from investment either way
- Creates tension with US export control objectives
- SEA positioned as "neutral ground" for AI compute

## AI opportunity

| Country | AI Strategy |
|---------|-------------|
| Singapore | Research hub |
| Vietnam | [[NVIDIA]] partnership |
| Indonesia | [[Consumer AI]] |
| Malaysia | Backend for AI chips |
| Philippines | AI services |

---

## Sovereign capital

| Country | Fund | AUM |
|---------|------|-----|
| Singapore | [[GIC]] + [[Temasek]] | $1.2T |
| Malaysia | Khazanah | $35B |
| Indonesia | INA | $20B |
| Others | Limited | N/A |

Singapore has most capital.

## Investment implications

**Exposure via:**
- Sea Group (SE)
- Grab (GRAB)
- GoTo (GOTO.JK)
- Singapore banks (DBS, UOB, OCBC)
- Equipment makers in region

---

## Quick stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined pop | 600M+ |
| Tech hub | Singapore |
| Manufacturing | Vietnam |
| Scale | Indonesia |
| Semiconductor | Malaysia |
