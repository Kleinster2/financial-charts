**Ethereum** — The second-largest cryptocurrency and leading smart contract platform. Unlike [[Bitcoin]]'s "digital gold" positioning, Ethereum is programmable money — a decentralized "world computer" running applications (DeFi, NFTs, L2s). Transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in Sep 2022 ("The Merge").

## Price history

![[eth-price-chart.png]]
*From ~$80 (2018 low) to ATH of $4.9K (Nov 2021). Highly correlated with Bitcoin but with higher beta. The Merge (Sep 2022) didn't immediately impact price.*

## How it differs from Bitcoin

| Dimension | [[Bitcoin]] | Ethereum |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Purpose | Store of value | Programmable platform |
| Consensus | Proof-of-Work | Proof-of-Stake |
| Supply cap | 21M fixed | No cap (~0.5% inflation) |
| Block time | ~10 min | ~12 sec |
| TPS (L1) | ~7 | ~30 |
| Smart contracts | Limited | Full (Solidity, EVM) |
| Energy use | ~212 TWh/yr | ~0.01 TWh/yr (99%+ reduction post-Merge) |

## Key events

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Nov 2013 | Whitepaper | [[Vitalik Buterin]] proposes programmable blockchain |
| Jul 2014 | ICO | Raised ~$18M (31K BTC) |
| Jul 2015 | Launch | Genesis block |
| Jun 2016 | The DAO hack | 3.6M ETH stolen; hard fork creates ETH/ETC split |
| Aug 2021 | EIP-1559 | Base fee burn mechanism (deflationary potential) |
| Sep 2022 | **The Merge** | PoW → PoS; energy use dropped 99%+ |
| Apr 2023 | Shanghai | Staking withdrawals enabled |
| Mar 2024 | Dencun | Blobs for L2 data; fees dropped 95% |
| Mid-2024 | ETF approval | SEC approved spot ETH ETFs |

## Use cases

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- **TVL:** ~$166B on Ethereum (66% of all DeFi)
- **Key protocols:** Aave (lending), Uniswap (DEX), Lido (staking), MakerDAO (DAI stablecoin)

### Layer 2 scaling
- **L2 TVL:** ~$45B
- **Top L2s:** Base (~$15B, [[Coinbase]]-backed), Arbitrum (~$19B), Optimism (~$8B)
- **Throughput:** L2s handle ~2M daily transactions (2x mainnet)

### NFTs
- Primary chain for high-value collections
- ~37% of historical ETH burns came from NFT activity

### Staking
- ~35.7M ETH staked (~30% of supply)
- Yield: 3-5% APY (varies by MEV)

## Supply dynamics

**EIP-1559 burn mechanism:** Base fee of every transaction is burned (destroyed).

**Post-Merge math:**
- Issuance: ~1,700 ETH/day (vs ~13,000/day under PoW)
- At gas >16 gwei: burn exceeds issuance (deflationary)
- Since Merge: 1.71M burned, 1.36M issued = net -346K ETH

**Current state:** Dencun upgrade (Mar 2024) dropped fees 95%, making ETH slightly inflationary (~0.7% annualized). L2s capture value that used to burn on mainnet.

## Bull case

| Thesis | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Institutional adoption** | BlackRock +224% ETH holdings in 2025; ETF flows |
| **ESG alignment** | PoS uses 99%+ less energy than PoW |
| **Network effects** | Most developer activity; EVM is industry standard |
| **DeFi dominance** | 66% of all DeFi TVL |
| **L2 ecosystem** | Base, Arbitrum, Optimism consolidated 90% of L2 activity |
| **Supply dynamics** | ~30% locked in staking/DeFi; burn mechanism |

---

## Bear case

| Risk | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **Revenue leakage** | L2s capture value; Dencun crushed mainnet fee revenue |
| **Solana competition** | 7x more daily active addresses; faster/cheaper |
| **No scarcity narrative** | Unlike Bitcoin's 21M cap |
| **Complexity** | Upgrade roadmap risk; fragmented L2 liquidity |
| **ETF flow reflexivity** | Risk-off macro could trigger outflows |

---

## Competition

| Chain | Strengths | Threat level |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| [[Solana]] | Faster, cheaper, 3.6M daily users vs ETH's 530K | High |
| Bitcoin | Store of value narrative | Low (different use case) |
| Sui | High TPS, fresh architecture | Medium |
| Base | Fastest-growing L2 | None (built on ETH) |

**Emerging dynamic:** Ethereum positioning as "institutional infrastructure" while Solana captures "consumer payments" vertical.

## Investment vehicles

| Vehicle | Type |
|---------|------|
| ETH-USD | Direct spot |
| ETH ETFs | BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale |
| [[Coinbase]] (COIN) | Exchange exposure |
| L2 tokens | OP, ARB (Optimism, Arbitrum) |
