## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Latest | [[Signal]] |
|--------|--------|--------|

## The K-shaped economy

| Segment | Status | Driver |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Higher income** | Strong | Asset appreciation, wage gains |
| **Lower income** | Struggling | Inflation erosion, credit tightening |

**[[Bank of America]] Institute:** "Spending, wages and income continue to grow for both groups" — but gap widening.

**[[Moody's]]:** "More cautious consumer behavior and affordability concerns will leave the retail and consumer durable industries the most vulnerable."

**Q4 2025:** Optimism fell 7pp YoY, pessimism rose 9pp — 16-point swing in net optimism.
