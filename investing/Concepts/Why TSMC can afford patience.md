[[TSMC]]'s "disciplined" capital allocation is enabled by dominance, not the cause of it. Patience is a luxury of monopolists.

> **Key insight:** Comparing Samsung unfavorably to TSMC's discipline ignores asymmetry. The same strategy would fail from Samsung's position. TSMC plays defense; challengers must play offense.

## The positional advantage

| TSMC position | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| ~60% foundry market share | No urgency to take unnecessary risks |
| ~90% of advanced logic | No credible challenger at leading edge |
| Customer lock-in via [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] | Switching costs protect market share |
| Yield leadership | Can wait for processes to mature |

**The monopolist's luxury:** When you have no real competition, patience has no cost.

## What "patience" looks like

**TSMC's approach:**

| Behavior | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Deliberate node lag overseas | Arizona 1-2 nodes behind Taiwan (see [[Node lag as strategy]]) |
| Yield-first mentality | Won't ship until yields mature |
| Conservative customer commitments | Under-promise, over-deliver |
| Gradual geographic expansion | Japan, Arizona, Germany — sequenced, not rushed |

**The result:** Predictable execution, customer trust, premium pricing.

## Why others can't copy this

**Samsung's dilemma:**

| If Samsung is patient | Outcome |
|----------------------|---------|
| TSMC extends lead | Samsung falls further behind |
| Customers stay with TSMC | No reason to switch |
| Investors punish stagnation | Multiple compression |

**The #2 trap:** "Disciplined" execution from #2 position = permanent irrelevance.

**Intel's dilemma:**
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] faces similar pressure
- Must prove viability to attract customers
- Can't afford multi-year patient ramp
- Investors demand turnaround evidence

## The benchmark fallacy

**Common mistake:** Praising TSMC's discipline and criticizing Samsung's aggression as if they face the same situation.

| Factor | TSMC | Samsung |
|--------|------|---------|
| Market position | Dominant | Challenger |
| Optimal strategy | Defense, compound advantages | Offense, take risks |
| Cost of patience | None | Market share loss |
| Cost of aggression | Unnecessary risk | Required for relevance |

**The asymmetry:** Same strategy, different outcomes based on position.

## When patience fails

Even TSMC's patience has limits:

| Scenario | TSMC response |
|----------|---------------|
| Samsung achieves yield parity | Would need to accelerate |
| Intel 18A succeeds | Would face pressure |
| China advances despite controls | Geopolitical response |
| Customer defection | Hasn't happened at scale |

**Current reality:** None of these threats are imminent, so patience continues.

## Investment implications

**For TSMC:**
- Patience = predictable earnings, lower volatility
- Premium multiple justified by execution quality
- Bear case is external (Taiwan risk), not execution

**For Samsung/Intel:**
- Aggressive strategies should be evaluated in context
- "Risky" moves may be *necessary*, not optional
- Judge by whether risks were worth taking, not whether they were taken
