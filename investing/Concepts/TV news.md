## MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Rebrand date | **November 15, 2025** |

| **Morning Joe** | Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski |
| **The Rachel Maddow Show** | Once weekly now |
| **The Last Word** | Lawrence O'Donnell |
| **All In** | Chris Hayes |

**Rebrand rationale:** Remove NBC branding ahead of Versant spinoff. Campaign: "Same mission. New name." ($20M ad spend).

**DTC plans:** Launching streaming service in 2026 as "digital hub for progressives."

**Challenge:** Audience aging, progressive niche limiting.
