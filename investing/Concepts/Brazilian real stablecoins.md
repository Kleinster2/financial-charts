# Brazilian real stablecoins

Tokens pegged 1:1 to the [[Brazilian real]]. Tiny market (~$23M total circulation) but the fastest-growing local stablecoin ecosystem globally — 230x transaction growth since 2021, 90K+ unique senders, $906M in H1 2025 trading volume. Stablecoins account for 60% of [[Brazil]]'s crypto activity and ~90% of crypto transaction volume (H1 2025: 227B reais / $42.8B).

## Market dynamics

The market is segmented by use case, not just size:

- Institutional FX: [[BBRL]] dominates — [[Braza Group]] is a top-6 interbank FX player, so the token inherits institutional plumbing. Few addresses, massive throughput.
- Retail remittances: [[BRLA]] leads in unique senders. Compliant fiat bridge.
- Exchange liquidity: [[BRZ]] has the deepest DEX pairs. [[BRL1]] is trying the consortium model.
- VC-backed growth: [[BRLV]] raised the most capital ([[Paradigm]]-led).
- Yield: [[BRD]] is the only token structured to pass through [[Selic]] interest. Regulatory arbitrage vs the [[GENIUS Act]] (which prohibits yield on US stablecoins).

The gap between $23M circulation and $906M H1 trading volume reflects high velocity — tokens move fast for payments/remittances, not held as a store of value (that's USD stablecoins' role in Brazil).

## Regulatory framework

[[Banco Central do Brasil|BCB]] resolutions (Nov 2025, effective Feb 2, 2026) classify stablecoin transactions as foreign-exchange operations. Providers face the same oversight as currency exchange businesses. This is structurally different from the US [[GENIUS Act]]:

| Feature | Brazil | US ([[GENIUS Act]]) |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Classification | FX operation | Payment instrument |
| Yield to holders | Allowed | Prohibited |
| Reserve requirement | Yes | 1:1 cash / T-bills |
| Oversight | [[Banco Central do Brasil|BCB]] | State / federal regulators |

Brazil's framework enables yield-bearing models like [[BRD]] — a regulatory gap that could attract capital from jurisdictions where yield is banned.

## Drex and B3

[[Banco Central do Brasil|BCB]]'s CBDC project (Drex) was reportedly shelved. [[B3]] (LatAm's largest stock exchange) stepped in — planning a real-pegged stablecoin for H1 2026 as a settlement layer for its new tokenization platform. B3's VP Luiz Masagão: tokenized and traditional assets will share the same liquidity pool.

This is significant: a major exchange using a stablecoin for securities settlement, not just crypto trading.

## Why it matters for the vault

1. Carry trade infrastructure. Brazil's 15% [[Selic]] rate is the highest since July 2006. Real-pegged stablecoins (especially yield-bearing [[BRD]]) tokenize that carry trade for global participants.
2. Regulatory arbitrage. The US/Brazil divergence on yield creates a structural opportunity — capital seeking on-chain yield may flow to BRL tokens.
3. [[B3]] entering the space. A top-10 global exchange building stablecoin-settled stock trading is a test case for traditional finance adoption.
4. Scale question. $23M circulation is trivial. The thesis depends on whether institutional demand (B3, Braza) can scale this 100x.
