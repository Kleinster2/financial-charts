**Propaganda thru Force** — Second Trump administration doctrine: military action and threats used primarily as messaging. Shows of force for domestic/global audience, political optics, and deterrence theater.

Part of [[Trump II]] hub.

---

## The doctrine

Force is communication. Actions chosen for propaganda value, not just strategic necessity.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shows of force** | Dramatic actions that send a message |
| **Political optics** | Military action timed/designed for PR |
| **Deterrence theater** | Demonstrating willingness to act |

---

## Examples

| Domain | Action | Target | Message |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Military** | [[Maduro capture 2026]] | Venezuela | "We will act unilaterally" |
| **Trade** | Liberation Day tariffs | World | "We set the rules" |
| **Trade** | Brazil tariffs | Brazil | "Free Bolsonaro" (Moraes pressure) |
| **Trade** | India tariffs | India | "Stop buying Russian oil" |
| **Immigration** | Raids | Domestic | "Laws enforced, visibly" |
| **Drugs** | Fentanyl tariffs → bomb threats → sinking boats → Maduro capture | Escalation | See below |
| **Territorial** | Greenland rhetoric | Denmark | "We can take what we want" |
| **Territorial** | Panama Canal threats | Panama | "Donroe Doctrine" |

All designed for maximum visibility. The action *is* the message.

## Drugs escalation

Show of force evolved from rhetoric to action:

| Stage | Action | Escalation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Fentanyl tariffs on China | Trade pressure |
| 2 | Threaten to bomb cartels in Mexico | Military rhetoric |
| 3 | Sinking drug boats | Military action |
| 4 | Maduro capture (narco-terrorism charge) | Regime intervention |

**Venezuela as convergence point:**

The Maduro capture serves multiple agendas simultaneously:

| Actor | Agenda | How Venezuela serves it |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **Drugs** | Show force against narco-state | Narco-terrorism indictment |
| **Miller** | Deportation pathway | [[Venezuela repatriation strategy]] |
| **Rubio** | Cuba regime change | [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] — cut lifeline |
| **Bessent** | China leverage | [[US-China commodity leverage]] — oil |

One action, four wins. That's why it happened.

## Maduro capture as case study

| Aspect | Traditional view | Propaganda view |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Why?** | Narco-terrorism prosecution | Demonstrate resolve |
| **Timing** | When ready | First week of term — maximum attention |
| **Announcement** | DOJ press release | Trump personal statement |
| **Framing** | Law enforcement | "US will run Venezuela" |

The capture was real. But the *way* it was executed and announced maximized propaganda value.

---

## Audience

| Audience | Message received |
|----------|------------------|
| **Domestic (US)** | "Trump delivers on promises" |
| **Latin America** | "US is back, don't cross us" |
| **China/Russia** | "We're unpredictable and willing" |
| **Allies** | "We act alone if needed" |
| **Cuba** | "You're next" — see [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] |

---

## Historical parallels

| Action | President | Propaganda value |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Bin Laden raid | Obama | "Justice delivered" |
| Soleimani strike | Trump 1.0 | "Red lines enforced" |
| Grenada invasion | Reagan | "Rescue Americans" |
| Panama invasion | Bush | "Noriega brought to justice" |

Trump 2.0 is more explicit about the messaging — force *is* the communication.

---

## Policy actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Trump** | Messenger-in-chief |
| **Rubio** | [[Cuba-Venezuela axis]] — strategic driver |
| **Miller** | [[Venezuela repatriation strategy]] — policy beneficiary |
| **Hegseth** | Defense execution |

---

## Investment implications

**Uncertainty premium:**
- Defense stocks benefit from unpredictability
- EM risk premium increases
- Oil volatility on intervention threats

**Watch for:**
- Next target of rhetoric (Cuba? Greenland? Panama?)
- Whether threats convert to action
- International response/isolation risk
