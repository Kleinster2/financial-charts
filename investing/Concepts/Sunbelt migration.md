## Why people move

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Affordability** | Lower cost of living (until recently) |
| **Taxes** | No state income tax (TX, FL) |
| **Jobs** | Corporate relocations, tech hubs |
| **Climate** | Weather preference |
| **Remote work** | COVID accelerated flexibility |
| **Business climate** | Pro-growth regulation |

## Recent deceleration

**Some slowdown in hottest markets:**

| Market | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| Florida large metros | Inflows continue but decelerating |
| Texas large metros | Same pattern |
| Phoenix | Substantial deceleration |
| Carolinas, Tennessee | Less deceleration |

**Cause:** "Supersized home price appreciation" — Sunbelt lost some affordability advantage.

## Emerging counter-trend (2025+)

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Climate change** | Heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes |
| **Insurance costs** | Florida rates spiking |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal risk |
| **Affordability erosion** | Price appreciation |

Some "Sunbelt to Snowbelt" migration emerging, but overall Sunbelt trend remains dominant.

## Housing market impact

**Why institutional SFR concentrated in Sunbelt (GAO/Urban Institute):**

| Metro | Institutional share of rentals |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Atlanta | **25%** |
| Jacksonville | 21% |
| Charlotte | 18% |
| Tampa | 15% |

**Pattern:** Institutional investors followed population growth, affordable land, landlord-friendly laws.
