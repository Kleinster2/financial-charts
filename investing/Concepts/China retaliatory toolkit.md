**China's retaliatory toolkit** — The set of countermeasures China deploys when facing Western technology restrictions. Ranges from targeted export controls to broad resource leverage.

---

## The toolkit

| Tool | Scope | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Targeted export controls** | Specific company | Blocking [[Nexperia]] exports (2025) |
| **Antitrust delays** | Specific deal | [[Qualcomm NXP blocked deal]] (2018) |
| **Rare earth controls** | Broad sector | [[Rare earth leverage]] |
| **Critical mineral bans** | Broad sector | Gallium, germanium restrictions (2023) |
| **Entity lists** | Specific companies | Unreliable Entity List |
| **Regulatory investigations** | Specific company | Micron security review (2023) |

---

## Escalation pattern

China's responses follow a predictable escalation:

1. **Diplomatic protest** — Statements condemning "politicization"
2. **Targeted retaliation** — Measures against specific company/deal
3. **Sectoral escalation** — Broader restrictions (rare earths, minerals)
4. **Asymmetric response** — Hitting different but valuable targets

## Case study: Nexperia seizure response

When the Netherlands seized [[Nexperia]] (Oct 2025):

| Date | China action |
|------|--------------|
| Oct 4 | Export controls on Nexperia China operations |
| Oct 9 | Tightened rare earth export controls |
| Ongoing | Diplomatic pressure |

See [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] for full timeline.

## Key resources China controls

| Resource | Global share | Used in |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Rare earths | ~60% mining, ~90% processing | EVs, wind turbines, defense |
| [[Gallium]] | ~99% refined | Semiconductors, 5G, radar |
| [[Germanium]] | ~60% refined | Fiber optics, IR, solar |
| [[Antimony]] | ~48% | **Ammunition (no substitute)**, flame retardants |
| Graphite | ~65% | Batteries |

See [[Rare earth leverage]] for rare earths. See [[Gallium]], [[Germanium]] for semiconductor materials.

## Effectiveness

**Strengths:**
- Resource leverage is real (no short-term alternatives)
- Can impose costs on specific Western companies
- Creates uncertainty for future M&A

**Limitations:**
- Accelerates Western "friendshoring" efforts
- Pushes development of alternative sources
- Risk of over-escalation harming China's own supply chains

---

## Investment implications

- Companies with China manufacturing exposure face retaliation risk
- Rare earth/critical mineral supply chains are investment targets
- M&A involving China market requires geopolitical scenario planning
- See [[Export controls]] for the Western side of the equation
