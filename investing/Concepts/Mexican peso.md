**Mexican peso** — Emerging market currency with one of the world's most attractive carry trades. Appreciated ~23% against USD in 2025 — largest gain since 1994.

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USDMXN | ~17.0 |
| 2025 return | **+23%** vs USD |
| Banxico rate | 7.0% |
| Fed rate | 3.50-3.75% |
| Rate differential | **325bp** |

---

## Why MXN was so strong in 2025

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Carry trade** | 325bp spread over Fed attracts yield-seeking flows |
| **USD weakness** | Fed pivot from peak hawkishness |
| **Nearshoring** | US companies moving manufacturing to Mexico, converting USD → MXN |
| **Tourism boom** | Record international visitors bringing dollars |
| **Sheinbaum confidence** | Market views her policies as pro-growth and business-friendly |
| **FDI record** | $41B in first 9 months of 2025 (+15% YoY) |

## Carry trade mechanics

The peso is a classic carry trade currency:

1. Borrow in low-yielding currency (USD at 3.75%)
2. Invest in high-yielding currency (MXN at 7%)
3. Pocket the 325bp spread
4. Risk: MXN depreciation wipes out carry

**Why it's been working:**
- Banxico cautious on cuts (preserving spread)
- Fed cutting (narrowing from US side)
- Low vol environment (carry thrives)

---

## Risks for 2026

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Banxico rate cuts** | Narrowing spread reduces carry attractiveness |
| **USMCA 2026 review** | Trade uncertainty |
| **Tariff threats** | Trump using trade policy as leverage |
| **BoJ normalization** | Global carry trade unwind (affects all EM FX) |
| **Risk-off event** | MXN historically volatile in selloffs |

---

## Seasonality and patterns

- **April weakness:** Tax-related outflows historically
- **US election years:** Volatility around tariff/trade rhetoric
- **Risk-off:** MXN sells off hard in global stress (high beta to SPX)

---

## Technical levels

| Level | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| 16.50 | Major support (2025 lows) |
| 17.00 | Current trading |
| 18.00 | First resistance |
| 20.00 | Crisis level (2020 COVID high) |

---

## Analyst views

**FXStreet (Dec 2025):**
> "Peso enters 2026 strong, but carry and USMCA risks loom large."

**Consensus 2026 forecast:** 17-19 USDMXN by year-end.
