# Enterprise AI adoption

The gap between AI hype and enterprise reality.

---

## The headline numbers (2025)

- **$37B** enterprise AI spending (up from $1.7B in 2023)
- **88%** of organizations using AI in at least one function
- **6%** of global SaaS market

Sounds bullish. But...

---

## The reality check

- **95% of AI pilots delivered no measurable P&L impact** (MIT "GenAI Divide" study, Aug 2025)
- **31%** of use cases reached full production (double from 2024, but still low)
- VCs predicted 2025 would be "the year" — now saying 2026

**Important caveat**: The 95% failure rate applies to broad enterprise pilots. Two clear exceptions:
1. **Coding tools** — 55% of departmental spend, clear ROI
2. **Agents** — 35% adoption, 66% seeing measurable value (see [[Agentic AI]])

**Pattern**: AI works where output is measurable and tasks are defined. Struggles where ROI is fuzzy (generic "transformation").

## Where the money actually goes

| Category | Share of departmental AI spend | ROI evidence |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| **Coding** | 55% ($4B) | **Strong** — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor |
| IT | 10% | Moderate |
| Marketing | 9% | Weak |
| Customer success | 9% | Mixed |
| Design | 7% | Moderate |
| HR | 5% | Weak |

**Coding is the killer app** — measurable output, clear productivity gains. Tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor have proven ROI. Everything else is more experimental.

**Why coding works:**
- Output is measurable (lines of code, tasks completed)
- Feedback loop is immediate (does it compile/run?)
- Developers are early adopters
- Integrates into existing workflows (IDE plugins)

---

## Why adoption lags

1. **Integration complexity** — AI doesn't plug into existing workflows
2. **Data readiness** — Enterprises don't have clean, accessible data
3. **ROI measurement** — Hard to quantify "productivity gains"
4. **Security/compliance** — Regulated industries move slow
5. **Vendor sprawl** — Too many tools, no clear winner

---

## Trade implications

**Be skeptical of:**
- "AI revenue growth" without margin disclosure
- Enterprise AI startups outside coding (long sales cycles, high churn)
- "AI transformation" narratives from legacy vendors
- Vertical AI solutions (customer service bots, sales AI)

**Bullish:**
- **Coding tools** — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor — proven ROI, clear winner
- Infrastructure (compute, not applications)
- Horizontal platforms with coding use cases

**The coding exception matters:**
- 55% of spend, clear ROI = this segment is real
- Companies enabling developer productivity are investable
- Don't conflate "enterprise AI failing" with "all AI failing"

---

## The 2026 prediction

VCs say 2026 is "the year" enterprises see real value.

They said the same about 2025. And 2024.

**What to watch:**
- CIO surveys on AI budget growth vs cuts
- Enterprise contract renewals (churn data)
- Actual productivity metrics (not surveys)
