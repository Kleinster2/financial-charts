# FDI Flows

Tracking global foreign direct investment inflows and outflows by country — who is attracting capital, who is deploying it, and how the map is shifting. FDI is a leading indicator of where productive capacity is being built.

## Global FDI overview

| Year | Global FDI | YoY | Adjusted (ex-conduits) | Source |
|------|-----------|-----|----------------------|--------|
| 2022 | $1.6T | — | — | UNCTAD |
| 2023 | $1.4T | -13% | — | UNCTAD |
| 2024 | $1.5T | +4% | -11% | UNCTAD WIR 2025 |
| 2025 (prelim) | $1.6T | +14% | ~+5% | UNCTAD GITM #50, Jan 2026 |

The headline number overstates recovery. Over $140B of the 2025 increase came from conduit flows through Luxembourg, Ireland, [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Stripping those out, underlying FDI grew ~5%.

Two consecutive years of decline (2023-2024) followed by a rebound concentrated in developed economies — developing countries saw flows *fall* 2% in 2025.

## Top FDI source countries (outflows, 2024)

| Rank | Country | Outflows ($B) | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | [[United States]] | 299 | Still largest source |
| 2 | [[Japan]] | 204 | Yen weakness driving offshore investment |
| 3 | [[China]] | 172 | First time outbound exceeded US share (H1 2025) |

See [[Capital flow reversal]] for the China outbound surge — $106.6B pledged Q1-Q3 2025, 85% greenfield.

---

## FDI by sector (2025 greenfield)

| Sector | Share / Value | Trend |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Data centers | >$270B announced, >20% of global greenfield | AI infrastructure boom |
| Semiconductors | +35% new project announcements | [[CHIPS Act]], supply chain security |
| Tariff-exposed (textiles, electronics, machinery) | -25% project numbers | Trade fragmentation |
| Renewable energy | Sharp pullback | Risk reassessment |
| Infrastructure | -10% | — |

Data centers are now the single largest category of greenfield FDI globally. [[France]], [[United States]], and [[South Korea]] lead as hosts. Emerging market recipients: [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]].

## Country deep-dives

### [[United States]] — inbound surge

$279-308B inflows (2024), sustained in 2025. Driven by:
- Semiconductor megaprojects ([[TSMC]] $100B, [[GlobalFoundries]] $16B)
- Pharma reshoring ([[AstraZeneca]] $50B, [[Novartis]] $23B, GSK $30B)
- Auto investment ([[Hyundai]] $26B, [[Stellantis]] $13B)
- AI infrastructure (DAMAC $20B)

Trump claims $21T in pledges; Bloomberg documents ~$7T. See [[Capital flow reversal]] for full breakdown.

### [[China]] — three-year decline

| Year | FDI Inflows | YoY |
|------|------------|-----|
| 2022 | ~$190B | Peak |
| 2023 | ~$163B | -14% |
| 2024 | ~$116B | -29% |
| 2025 | Recovery signs | Positive from negative base |

China slipped from #2 to #4 recipient globally. Both [[India]] and [[Indonesia]] now receive more FDI. Drivers: geopolitical risk, [[China plus one]] supply chain shifts, regulatory uncertainty. But 2025 shows early recovery as Q2/Q3 2024 negative base effects wash out.

Meanwhile, China outbound FDI hit records — see [[Capital flow reversal]]. State banks funding overseas factory expansion as domestic investment collapses.

### [[India]] — greenfield powerhouse

$28B inflows (2024), flat YoY but #3 globally for greenfield projects. Over 1,000 projects totaling ~$109B in announced greenfield investment. Key sectors: semiconductors, basic metals, manufacturing. FDI concentrated in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka.

### [[Brazil]] — LATAM leader

~$72B inflows (2024, +14%). Record $41B in first 9 months of 2025 (+15% YoY). Manufacturing 37% of total. Sources: US (30%), [[Spain]], Netherlands, [[Japan]], [[Canada]]. [[ByteDance]] $38B data center is the single largest pledged greenfield project globally. See [[Lei 4131]] for regulatory framework.

### [[Mexico]] — nearshoring + risk

~$45B inflows (2024, +48%). 24% of LATAM total. Nearshoring momentum from [[China plus one]] and USMCA rules of origin. But caught between US and China — cracking down on Chinese investment to appease Washington while needing the capital. 50% tariffs on 1,400 Asian products (Jan 2026). See [[Capital flow reversal]].

### [[ASEAN]] — record year

$225-235B (2024), +8-10% YoY. Record. [[Indonesia]] (batteries, nickel — Chinese investment), [[Vietnam]] ($26B, +33% YoY on 8mo basis), Singapore (hub), [[Thailand]] (data centers, manufacturing). [[China plus one]] is the structural driver.

### [[Africa]] — breakout

$97B (2024), +75% YoY — all-time high. Liberalization, facilitation, and Chinese greenfield investment. [[Nigeria]] $20B gas city (CNCEC), Morocco EV factories (Chinese, for [[EU]] export). Shift from resource extraction to manufacturing + market access.

---

## FDI concentration in developing countries (2019-2023 avg)

| Country | Share of developing-country FDI |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| [[China]] | 37% |
| [[Brazil]] | 10% |
| [[India]] | 9% |
| [[Mexico]] | 6% |
| [[Indonesia]] | 4% |
| [[Vietnam]] | 3% |
| Top 6 total | ~69% |

Nearly 70% of all FDI to developing countries goes to just six economies.

---

## Structural shifts

Geopolitical fragmentation — FDI increasingly follows alliance lines. US-allied countries gaining share, [[China]] redirecting to Global South. Tariff-exposed sectors (-25% projects) vs geopolitically safe sectors (semis, pharma = booming).

Data centers as FDI category — did not exist as a meaningful category five years ago. Now >20% of global greenfield. AI infrastructure driving a new class of $10B+ cross-border projects.

[[China]] reversal — shifting from world's #2 FDI destination to world's #3 FDI source. Outbound exceeds inbound momentum. State-bank funded, greenfield-dominant, concentrated in [[ASEAN]] and [[Africa]].

Conduit problem — $140B+ of headline FDI growth is pass-through flows via Luxembourg, Ireland, [[Switzerland]]. Headline numbers overstate actual productive investment. [[OECD]] and UNCTAD both now report "adjusted" figures.

---

## 2026 outlook

UNCTAD (Jan 2026): Modest growth possible if financing eases and M&A picks up. But real investment likely subdued — geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and economic fragmentation weighing. Risk of further concentration in few regions and sectors.

Key watchpoints:
- US tariff regime and impact on nearshoring FDI ([[Mexico]], [[Vietnam]])
- China outbound acceleration vs Western screening
- Data center FDI sustainability (AI capex cycle)
- [[Africa]] liberalization momentum
- [[EU]] FDI recovery (real or conduit?)
