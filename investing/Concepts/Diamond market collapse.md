# Diamond market collapse

Natural diamond prices have fallen ~40%+ from 2022 peaks to multi-decade lows, driven by lab-grown disruption, China demand collapse, and the unraveling of the supply management regime that sustained artificial scarcity for nearly a century.

## Three forces

### 1. Lab-grown diamonds
The existential threat. Lab-grown diamonds are chemically, optically, and physically identical to mined diamonds — even gemologists can't tell the difference without specialized equipment. Prices have cratered as production scaled (mainly India and China), with retail prices falling throughout 2024. Lab-grown went from a novelty to ~20%+ of engagement ring sales.

[[De Beers]] tried to maintain the "natural is special" narrative but simultaneously launched its own lab-grown brand (Lightbox) at $800/carat in 2018 — inadvertently validating the product it was trying to suppress.

### 2. China demand collapse
The 2011 diamond spike to ~8,500 was largely [[China luxury boom and bust|China's luxury boom]] — a newly wealthy middle class discovering Western luxury brands all at once. [[De Beers]] deliberately imported the engagement ring tradition with targeted Chinese campaigns. That bid is now in full reverse: China's mainland luxury market fell 18-20% in 2024 (Bain), Chinese retailers are offloading $2B+ in polished diamond inventory (Fortune, Feb 2025), and younger Chinese consumers have embraced lab-grown diamonds faster than Western markets — less cultural attachment to the "natural is special" narrative.

### 3. De Beers / Anglo American breakup
[[Anglo American]] announced it will spin off or sell [[De Beers]] (May 2024), ending an almost century-long relationship. De Beers essentially invented artificial diamond scarcity — controlling supply through its Central Selling Organisation, stockpiling rough diamonds, and spending billions on "A Diamond is Forever" marketing. With Anglo cutting it loose and writing down $5.2B+ in value, the entity that managed the diamond cartel is losing its grip.

## Historical context

The diamond market was never a free market. [[De Beers]] controlled 80%+ of global rough diamond supply through the mid-20th century, declining to ~30% today. The entire value proposition — "diamonds are rare and eternal" — was manufactured marketing. Diamonds are among the most common gemstones geologically. The 2011 peak (~8,500) and 2022 peak (~6,500) were demand spikes (China luxury boom and post-Covid revenge spending), not structural. Both faded.

## Evolution

- **1888**: [[Cecil Rhodes]] founds De Beers Consolidated Mines, begins monopolizing supply
- **1938**: De Beers hires N.W. Ayer → "A Diamond is Forever" campaign (1947). Invented the engagement ring norm
- **1930s-2000s**: Central Selling Organisation controls 80%+ of rough diamond distribution
- **2000s**: Cartel weakens — Russia, Australia, Canada mine independently. De Beers share falls to ~35%
- **2011**: Price peak (~8,500) on China luxury demand
- **2015-2018**: Lab-grown diamonds achieve gem quality at commercial scale
- **2018**: De Beers launches Lightbox (lab-grown brand) — unintentionally legitimizes competitors
- **2022**: Post-Covid revenge spending spike (~6,500), then collapse begins
- **2024 May**: [[Anglo American]] announces De Beers spinoff/sale
- **2024-2025**: Rough prices -40%+. Anglo writes down De Beers by $5.2B cumulative
- **2025**: Debswana cuts output 40%. Diamond price index hits 20-year lows (~3,400)

## Investment implications

**This is a commodity losing its moat.** Unlike gold (which has industrial uses, central bank demand, and millennia of monetary history), diamonds' value was always narrative-driven. Lab-grown diamonds broke that narrative by proving the stones aren't rare — they're manufacturable.

**Winners:**
- Lab-grown producers (though margins are compressing as production scales)
- Consumers — engagement rings getting much cheaper
- Other luxury goods (watches, handbags) that retain scarcity

**Losers:**
- [[De Beers]] / [[Anglo American]] — stranded assets, massive writedowns
- Mining-dependent nations: [[Botswana]] (diamonds = 30% GDP), Namibia, South Africa
- Retailers holding natural diamond inventory

**Template for disruption:** The diamond collapse is a case study in what happens when a commodity's value is based on artificial scarcity and a competitor can produce an identical substitute at 90% lower cost. Potential parallels in other "prestige" commodities.
