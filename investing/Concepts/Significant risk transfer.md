**Significant risk transfer** — [[Banks]] sell credit-linked notes to offload loan portfolio risk, manage capital ratios, and free balance sheet for more lending.

## How SRTs work

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Bank identifies loan portfolio to hedge |
| 2 | Structures credit-linked notes tied to portfolio |
| 3 | Sells notes to institutional investors |
| 4 | Investors absorb first-loss or mezzanine tranche |
| 5 | Bank retains senior tranche, reduces RWA |

**Result:** Bank transfers credit risk without selling loans outright. Frees regulatory capital.
