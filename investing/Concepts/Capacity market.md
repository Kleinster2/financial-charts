**Capacity market** — mechanism used by grid operators like [[PJM]] to ensure sufficient power supply exists to meet future demand. Generators are paid to be available, not just for electricity they produce.

---

## How it works

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | Ensure grid has enough supply to meet peak demand + reserves |
| Mechanism | Auction where generators bid to provide capacity |
| Timeframe | Typically 3 years ahead (PJM RPM auction) |
| Payment | $/MW-day for being available, regardless of dispatch |
| Operator | [[Regional Transmission Organization|RTOs]] ([[PJM]], MISO, ISO-NE) run the auctions |

## Why this matters now

The capacity market is under stress from AI-driven demand growth:

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| [[PJM]] Dec 2025 auction | 6.5 GW shortfall — not enough supply cleared |
| [[PJM]] 10-year projection | **60 GW shortfall**, ~$180B cost |
| Contract duration | Currently 12 months; discussion about 10-year commitments |
| Emergency auction | Trump administration pushing [[PJM]] to hold one in Sep 2026 |

The shift from 12-month to potentially 10-year capacity commitments would be a structural change — it would give generators revenue certainty to finance new construction, but expose grid operators to long-term procurement risk.
