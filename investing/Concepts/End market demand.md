Semiconductor demand by end market — the macro picture driving the supply chain.

## Current mix (2024)

| End market | Wafer share | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Smartphones | 22% | Largest but mature |
| Others | 18% | Telecom, consoles, appliances |
| Automotive | 17% | Post-EV boom settling |
| Servers/Datacenter | 15% | AI driving growth |
| PCs | 14% | Recovering from 2023 trough |
| Industrial | 14% | Stable |

## Growth rates by segment

| Segment | 2023 | 2024 | 2025e |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Servers | +11% | +26% | +23% |
| Smartphones | -2% | +8% | +3% |
| PCs | -16% | +2% | +8% |
| Automotive | +17% | +7% | +7% |
| Industrial | 0% | -5% | +2% |
| **Total** | -1% | +6% | +8% |

## The AI concentration

**Datacenter = 15% of total wafer consumption but 50% of 2025 incremental demand.**

This is why the entire supply chain is tilting toward AI:
- [[TSMC]] prioritizes AI chip customers (NVIDIA, Apple)
- [[SK Hynix]] HBM cannibalizes commodity DRAM
- [[ASML]] EUV demand driven by leading edge logic
- [[ASE]] expanding AI/HPC packaging capacity

AI isn't the biggest market yet — but it's where all the growth is.

## Implications by thesis

| Thesis | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| [[Long TSMC]] | Leading edge demand concentrated in AI/DC |
| [[Long memory]] | HBM demand from servers, commodity from smartphones |
| [[Long WFE]] | Fab buildout driven by AI capex |
| [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] | AI chips need advanced packaging/test |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Samsung/SK Hynix benefit from same AI demand |

## End market health check

**Strong:**
- Servers/Datacenter — AI capex accelerating
- PCs — recovery after 2023 trough, AI PC refresh cycle

**Stable:**
- Smartphones — mature, modest growth
- Automotive — post-EV boom normalization

**Weak:**
- Industrial — slow recovery

---

## Inventory cycle

- 2023: Inventory headwinds — shipments > consumption
- 2024: Headwinds decreasing
- 2025: Heading to parity — consumption catching up

When inventory normalizes, demand flows through to the supply chain. Bullish for wafer suppliers (Siltronic), foundries, WFE.

## What to watch

- [ ] Hyperscaler capex guidance (quarterly earnings)
- [ ] Server shipment data
- [ ] Smartphone sell-through (China recovery?)
- [ ] Automotive chip demand (EV adoption pace)
- [ ] PC refresh cycle (AI PCs)
