# Tianhe Supercomputers

[[China]]'s flagship supercomputer series. Built by [[NUDT]] (military). Demonstrated [[China]] could build world-leading HPC. Now pivoting to AI workloads.

## The Tianhe series

| System | Year | Performance | Global rank | Note |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Tianhe-1 | 2009 | 1.2 PFLOPS | #5 | First major [[China]] entry |
| Tianhe-1A | 2010 | 2.6 PFLOPS | #1 | [[China]]'s first #1 ranking |
| Tianhe-2 | 2013 | 33.9 PFLOPS | #1 | Held #1 for 3 years |
| Tianhe-2A | 2018 | 61 PFLOPS | Top 5 | [[Matrix]]-2000 upgrade |
| Tianhe-3 | 2021+ | Exascale target | TBD | In development |

## Tianhe-2 significance

The most important system in the series:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Guangzhou (National Supercomputer Center) |
| Architecture | [[Intel]] Xeon + Xeon Phi |
| Peak | 54.9 PFLOPS |
| Reign | #1 from June 2013 to June 2016 |
| Applications | Weather, materials, genomics |

**The wake-up call:** Tianhe-2 demonstrated [[China]] could build world's fastest computer. Triggered US response.

---

## US export controls

Tianhe-2's success led directly to restrictions:

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2015 | [[Intel]] Xeon Phi sales to NUDT banned |
| 2015 | Four supercomputer centers Entity Listed |
| 2019 | Additional entities added |
| Effect | Forced domestic chip development |

**The irony:** US chips powered [[China]]'s supercomputing rise. Then US closed the door.

---

## Domestic chip response

Post-2015, NUDT accelerated domestic alternatives:

| Chip | Type | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| [[Matrix]]-2000 | DSP accelerator | Deployed in Tianhe-2A |
| [[Matrix]]-3000 | Next-gen DSP | In development |
| Sunway | Alternative architecture | Powers other [[China]] HPC |

**Tianhe-2A upgrade:** Replaced [[Intel]] Xeon Phi with [[Matrix]]-2000. Less performance but no US dependency.

## Tianhe for AI?

Supercomputers vs AI clusters are different:

| Aspect | Traditional HPC | AI training |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Workload | Simulation, modeling | Neural network training |
| Precision | FP64 (double) | FP16, BF16 (lower) |
| Interconnect | MPI, commodity | NVLink, custom |
| Memory | Less critical | HBM essential |

**Tianhe limitation:** Optimized for scientific computing, not AI training. Modern AI needs GPU clusters (see [[China AI clusters]]).

**Adaptation:** Some Tianhe capacity repurposed for AI inference, but not competitive with dedicated AI infrastructure.

---

## Tianhe-3 (exascale)

| [[Target]] | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Performance | 1+ exaFLOP |
| Architecture | Fully domestic |
| Timeline | Announced 2021, status unclear |
| Challenge | Domestic chips less efficient |

**Significance:** If achieved with domestic chips, proves [[China]] can build frontier compute without US.

---

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** (NUDT, state project).

**Indirect relevance:**
- Demonstrates [[China]] compute ambition
- Domestic chip development accelerates
- AI is displacing traditional HPC priorities

**Thesis implications:**
- Export controls work (forced domestic development)
- But domestic development is happening
- AI clusters (not supercomputers) are the new frontier
- Military compute capacity is non-public
