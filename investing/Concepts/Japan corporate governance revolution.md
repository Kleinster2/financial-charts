# Japan corporate governance revolution

A decade-long transformation of [[Japan]]ese corporate culture from insider-oriented, cross-shareholding capitalism to shareholder-value-focused governance. Accelerated dramatically in 2023 when the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] demanded companies trading below book value publish improvement plans. By 2026, the majority of listed companies trade above book value, buybacks hit record ¥35T, and ROE is structurally improving.

## Timeline

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2014 | Japan Stewardship Code adopted — institutional investors expected to engage |
| 2015 | Corporate Governance Code introduced under [[Shinzo Abe]]. Independent director requirements begin |
| 2018 | Code revised — minimum two independent directors required |
| 2021 | [[Hiromi Yamaji]] takes over [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. Prime Market created with higher governance standards |
| 2023 | **TSE "name and shame"**: companies below 1x P/B must publish capital improvement plans. Cross-shareholding unwinding accelerates |
| 2024 | Cross-shareholdings declining measurably. Record buybacks. Global investors return (Nikkei breaks 1989 ATH) |
| 2025 | Nikkei Inc analysis: corporate reform "gradually taking root." ROE improvement broadening beyond large caps |
| 2026 | [[Sanae Takaichi]] government adds tax incentives (7% productivity credit, 50% R&D credit) on top of TSE push |

## The PBR problem

More than 50% of Japanese listed companies traded below book value (P/B < 1x) — meaning the market valued them below liquidation value. This reflected:
- **Cash hoarding**: Japanese corporates accumulated massive cash piles (fear of deflation)
- **Cross-shareholdings**: companies held each other's shares for relationship stability, not returns
- **Low ROE**: average ROE ~8% vs ~15% for US companies
- **Management complacency**: stable shareholder bases insulated management from accountability

The TSE's 2023 intervention was unprecedented: effectively telling companies "explain why you're worth less than your assets, or fix it." [[Hiromi Yamaji]] frames it as "transforming the mindset of management."

## Cross-shareholding unwinding

Japan's uniquely interlocking ownership structure — where banks, insurers, and industrial companies hold each other's shares — is being systematically dismantled. This releases:
- **Supply of shares** for buybacks
- **Capital** for productive investment
- **Accountability** as management can no longer rely on friendly shareholders

## Impact

- Record IPO and M&A activity on TSE (¥35T trading volume, 5,100+ listed companies)
- [[Warren Buffett]]'s endorsement via trading house investments validated the thesis globally
- [[Apollo]]'s [[Mark Rowan]]: "generational change in corporate governance"
- [[BlackRock]], [[J.P. Morgan]], [[State Street]] all publishing bullish Japan governance research
- DXJ (yen-hedged Japan ETF) returned ~35% in 2025

## Risks

- Reform is uneven — large caps leading, small caps lagging
- "Box-ticking" risk: companies publish plans without meaningful change
- TSE has no enforcement mechanism beyond public pressure and delisting threat
- Demographic headwinds may limit ROE improvement regardless of governance
- Political continuity risk if Takaichi coalition fragments
