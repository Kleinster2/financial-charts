The thesis that companies increasingly derive value from programmatic interfaces rather than user interfaces, with APIs becoming the primary product.

## Core idea

As [[AI agents]] become primary consumers of services, the companies that win are those with clean programmatic access to defensible capabilities. The UI becomes secondary—a convenience layer for humans—while the real product is the endpoint.

Sam Altman (Feb 2025): "Soon every company will be an API company."

## Investment framework

**Winners:**
- Companies with proprietary data or capabilities behind the API
- Defensible moats: unique datasets, trained models, licensed content, regulatory approvals
- Examples: [[Stripe]] (payments rails), [[Twilio]] (communications), [[Plaid]] (financial data)

**Losers:**
- Thin wrappers around commodity functionality
- UI-only products that agents can't consume
- Middleware without lock-in

**Key question:** What's behind the endpoint that others can't replicate?

## Implications

1. **Product design shifts** — API-first development, UI as afterthought
2. **Monetization changes** — Usage-based pricing over seat licenses
3. **Competitive dynamics** — [[Network effects]] from agent integrations
4. **M&A logic** — Acquirers want the API, not the app

## Relation to existing trends

Evolution of "software is eating the world" → "APIs are eating software." The programmatic layer becomes the actual product; everything else is presentation.

Distinct from [[Platform economics]] (multi-sided markets) — API-first is about the interface layer, not necessarily about connecting multiple user groups.
