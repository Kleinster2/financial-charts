**Basel III** — International banking regulations developed after [[GFC]]. Higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks.

---

## Key requirements

| Metric | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| CET1 ratio | 4.5% minimum |
| Tier 1 capital | 6% minimum |
| Total capital | 8% minimum |
| Leverage ratio | 3% minimum |
| LCR | 100% (liquidity) |

Plus countercyclical buffers for systemically important banks.

## Impact on lending

Higher capital requirements made certain loans uneconomic for banks:
- [[Middle-market]] loans (higher risk weights)
- Longer-duration credit
- Complex structures

Banks retreated; [[direct lender]]s and [[Private credit]] filled gap.

---

## Basel III Endgame

US implementation delayed/modified. Banks lobbied against stricter rules. Final rules expected 2025-2026.
