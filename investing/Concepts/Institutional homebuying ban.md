## Market impact (Jan 7, 2026)

| Stock | Move | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | -6% | Down 9.3% intraday |
| [[Invitation Homes]] | -7% | Largest single-family landlord |
| [[BlackRock]] | Down | Also exposed |

## Background

**Institutional ownership growth:**
- Post-2008 crisis: PE firms bought foreclosed homes
- Blackstone built Invitation Homes (IPO'd 2017)
- Single-family rental became institutional asset class
- [[Home]] prices +55% from 2020 to Q3 2025 (NAHB data)

**Public frustration:**
- First-time buyers priced out
- Competing with cash offers
- Rent increases
- [[Housing affordability crisis]]

## How much do institutions actually own?

**National figures (all single-family homes):**

| Category | % of all SFH |
|----------|--------------|
| All investors | ~20% of 86M homes |
| Small investors (1-5 homes) | **87% of investor-owned** |
| Mega institutional (1,000+ homes) | **~3%** (~450K homes) |

**But Sunbelt rental markets are different (GAO/Urban Institute 2024):**

| Metro | Institutional share of **rentals** | Homes |
|-------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **Atlanta** | **25%** | **72,000** |
| Jacksonville | 21% | — |
| Charlotte | 18% | 24,000 |
| Tampa | 15% | 23,000 |
| Phoenix | — | 33,000 |
| Dallas | — | 27,000 |

**Top 6 metros = 45% of all mega-operator holdings.**

**Key distinction:** The national "3%" figure is accurate for all SFH stock, but understates concentration in Sunbelt rental markets where institutional landlords dominate.

**Purchase activity (Q3 2025):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investor share of home sales | 34% (5-year high) |
| Institutional share of purchases | <2% |
| Institutional net position | **Net sellers 6+ quarters** |

## Who's exposed

**Largest institutional owners:**

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Invitation Homes]] | Largest single-family landlord |
| American Homes 4 Rent | \#2 single-family |
| [[Blackstone]] | ~2% of RE AUM, 230K apartments |
| [[BlackRock]] | Various RE funds |
| [[Apollo]] | PE real estate |

**Blackstone response:** "We have been a net seller of homes over the last decade — holdings down more than one-fifth."

## Homebuilder impact

Mixed — could be positive or negative:

**Potentially bullish:**
- Less competition from institutional buyers
- More homes available for owner-occupants
- Could boost demand from individuals

**Potentially bearish:**
- Institutional buyers = reliable bulk purchasers
- Some builders sell directly to rental operators
- Uncertainty = pause in activity

## Implementation questions

| Question | Unknown |
|----------|---------|
| Definition of "large" | Threshold unclear |
| Existing portfolios | Forced sales or grandfathered? |
| Enforcement mechanism | Regulatory or legislative? |
| Timeline | Details at Davos |

---

## Investment implications

| If ban is strong | If ban is weak |
|------------------|----------------|
| Invitation Homes hurt | Relief rally |
| Blackstone limited impact | Back to normal |
| Homebuilders mixed | Homebuilders neutral |
| Housing prices? | Status quo |

Watch Davos for details.
