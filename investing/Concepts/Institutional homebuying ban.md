## Background

**Institutional ownership growth:**
- Post-2008 crisis: PE firms bought foreclosed homes
- Blackstone built Invitation Homes (IPO'd 2017)
- Single-family rental became institutional asset class
- Home prices +55% from 2020 to Q3 2025 (NAHB data)

**Public frustration:**
- First-time buyers priced out
- Competing with cash offers
- Rent increases
- Housing affordability crisis

## Who's exposed

**Largest institutional owners:**

| Company | Exposure |
|---------|----------|
| [[Invitation Homes]] | Largest single-family landlord |
| American Homes 4 Rent | #2 single-family |
| [[Blackstone]] | ~2% of RE AUM, 230K apartments |
| [[BlackRock]] | Various RE funds |
| [[Apollo]] | PE real estate |

**Blackstone response:** "We have been a net seller of homes over the last decade — holdings down more than one-fifth."

## Homebuilder impact

Mixed — could be positive or negative:

**Potentially bullish:**
- Less competition from institutional buyers
- More homes available for owner-occupants
- Could boost demand from individuals

**Potentially bearish:**
- Institutional buyers = reliable bulk purchasers
- Some builders sell directly to rental operators
- Uncertainty = pause in activity

## Implementation questions

| Question | Unknown |
|----------|---------|
| Definition of "large" | Threshold unclear |
| Existing portfolios | Forced sales or grandfathered? |
| Enforcement mechanism | Regulatory or legislative? |
| Timeline | Details at Davos |

## Investment implications

| If ban is strong | If ban is weak |
|------------------|----------------|
| Invitation Homes hurt | Relief rally |
| Blackstone limited impact | Back to normal |
| Homebuilders mixed | Homebuilders neutral |
| Housing prices? | Status quo |

Watch Davos for details.
