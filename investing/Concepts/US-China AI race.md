**US-China AI race** — The defining tech competition of the 2020s. Both nations treating AI as economic, political, and national defense imperative.

## The gap (mid-2025)

**Humanity's Last Exam** (thousands of questions across math, science):

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| OpenAI | >20% |
| Google | >20% |
| xAI | >20% |
| DeepSeek | 14% |
| Qwen (Alibaba) | 11% |

**Sam Altman (May 2025):** "It is very hard to say how far ahead we are. But I would say not a huge amount of time."

**LiveBench (Jan 2026):**
- Google Gemini 3 overtook OpenAI for top-3 (Nov 2025)
- 2 Chinese low-cost models in top-15

## Patent race (IFI CLAIMS)

| Rank | Entity | ~Patents |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Google | 575 |
| 2 | **Zhejiang University** (China) | 475 |
| 3 | Microsoft | 325 |
| 4 | **UESTC** (China) | 275 |
| 5 | **Baidu** | 275 |
| 6 | NVIDIA | 275 |
| 7 | IBM | 275 |
| 8 | **Tsinghua University** | 250 |
| 9 | **Hangzhou Dianzi University** | 250 |
| 10 | **State Grid Corp of China** | 225 |

**Key insight:** 5 of top 10 are Chinese (4 universities + State Grid). Chinese universities punching above weight despite chip constraints.

## Investment (2025)

| Category | US | China |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Big tech capex | **$370B+** (Big 4) | $24B (Alibaba, Tencent) |
| Government | Indirect (tax, permits) | **$56B** direct |
| VC | $193B global (US-dominated) | $8.2B AI Industry Fund |
| Total AI capex | — | **$98B** (+48% YoY) |

**Decade prior (China):** $912B govt-backed VC → 1.4M AI-related firms.

---

## Talent

| Metric | US | China |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Top AI company immigrant founders | **60%** | — |
| AI grad students (international) | **70%** | — |
| Repatriation program | — | Thousand Talents (7,000+ lured back) |
| Top researcher pay | **$100M+** packages | Patriotism pitch |

**Risk:** US talent pipeline depends on immigration policy. Tighter visas = advantage China.

## Infrastructure asymmetry

| Factor | US | China |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Chips** | Abundant (Blackwell) | Constrained (H200 only) |
| **Power** | Constrained (44GW gap) | Abundant (429GW added 2024) |
| **Power cost** | Market rates | Cut-price (subsidized) |
| **Permitting** | Years of red tape | State-directed, fast |
| **Data** | Open internet | Censored but state-curated |

**The trade-off:**
- US: Best chips, can't power them
- China: Unlimited power, can't get best chips

## Policy responses

**US (Trump AI Action Plan, July 2025):**
- Cut red tape for data centers
- New energy sources for AI
- Open source as "geostrategic value"
- Threaten funds from states with burdensome AI rules

**Trump:** "The US will do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence."

**China:**
- AI classes in elementary schools
- Provincial subsidies for AI startups
- Cut-price power for AI operations
- Surveillance deployment allowed
- Content censorship required

**Xi Jinping:** "AI should not be a game of rich countries."

---

## Open source strategy

**China's approach:** Sacrifice short-term profits for global adoption.

| US model | China model |
|----------|-------------|
| Closed (OpenAI, Anthropic) | Open weights (DeepSeek, Qwen) |
| $100s/month subscriptions | Free to use/adapt |
| Maximize revenue | Maximize adoption |

**OpenAI pivot (Aug 2025):** Released pair of open models after DeepSeek R1 shock.

> "If China's developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access, the race for AI is effectively over." — OpenAI

## The players

**US:**
- [[OpenAI]] — ChatGPT, o1/o3 reasoning
- [[Google]] — Gemini, TPUs
- [[Anthropic]] — Claude
- [[xAI]] — Grok, Colossus
- [[Meta]] — Llama (open)

**China:**
- [[DeepSeek]] — R1, efficiency leader
- [[Alibaba]] — Qwen
- [[ByteDance]] — Doubao
- [[Baidu]] — Ernie
- Zhipu, Moonshot — rising stars
- Manus — AI agent (global attention)

---

## Investment implications

**Not a binary outcome.** Both ecosystems will thrive in different ways:

| US advantage | China advantage |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Frontier research | Deployment at scale |
| Closed model revenue | Open model adoption |
| Chip quality | Chip quantity (power) |
| Global cloud platforms | Domestic + SEA markets |

**Watch for:**
- DeepSeek R2 (Feb 2026) — could narrow gap further
- US immigration policy changes
- Power infrastructure buildout (both sides)
- Open source commoditization pressure
