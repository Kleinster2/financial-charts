## Manufacturing — assembly, not production

### What works

| Sector | Status | Key players |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Electronics assembly | iPhone production growing | Foxconn, Tata Electronics |
| Pharma generics | Global leader | Sun, Dr. Reddy's |
| Auto assembly | Strong domestic market | Maruti, Tata Motors, M&M |
| Textiles | Export strength | Varied |

### What doesn't work

| Sector | Constraint | See |
|--------|------------|-----|
| EV batteries | Chinese tech licensing blocked | [[China battery leverage]] |
| Semiconductors | Legacy nodes only (28nm+) | India Semiconductor Mission |
| Solar panels | 80% imports from China | — |
| Power equipment | BHEL uncompetitive | — |

**Root cause:** R&D gap. India spends 0.6% of GDP on R&D (flat for 27 years) vs China at 2.5%.

## Manufacturing constraints — detail

### Battery failure

| Metric | Plan | Reality |
|--------|------|---------|
| Subsidy pool | ₹181B ($2B) | — |
| Capacity target | 50 GWh | **1 GWh installed** |
| Timeline | By 2027 | 2% of target |

**Why:** Chinese tech licensing blocked. Alternatives 30-50% more expensive. See [[China battery leverage]].

### Battery imports

Imports grew 2.5x (2018-2025) while domestic manufacturing failed.

### Rare earths

India announced $800M for domestic magnet production, but:
- Minimal mining despite reserves
- China controls 90% of processing
- Some critical minerals not extractable domestically
