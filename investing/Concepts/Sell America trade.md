# Sell America trade

The simultaneous selling of US equities, [[Treasuries]], and the dollar—a correlation break signaling capital leaving the US entirely rather than rotating to safety within US markets.

## What makes it distinctive

In normal risk-off episodes:
- Equities fall
- [[Treasuries]] **rally** (flight to safety)
- Dollar **strengthens** (safe haven)

The "Sell America" trade breaks this pattern:
- Equities fall
- [[Treasuries]] **also fall** (yields spike)
- Dollar **weakens**

This isn't "risk-off"—it's "get out of America." The traditional 60/40 portfolio loses its diversification benefit because the negative stock-bond correlation breaks down.

## April 2025: Liberation Day

The defining episode. On April 2, 2025, Trump announced sweeping tariffs ("Liberation Day"). The initial reaction was textbook flight-to-safety—investors bought [[Treasuries]]. Then everything reversed.

**The numbers:**
- 30-year yield: +50 bps in one week, biggest move since 1987
- 10-year yield: swung 53 bps in three days (3.87% → 4.49%), biggest since December 2001
- DXY: -10.7% in H1 2025, worst first-half in 50+ years
- DXY full-year 2025: -9.6%, worst annual decline since 2017

One Fed official attributed the Treasury spike partly to forced unwinding of the swap-spread trade. But the broader signal was unmistakable: [[Treasuries]] behaved "like a risky asset under pressure."

## January 2026: Greenland revival

The trade returned after Trump threatened tariffs on eight NATO countries over Greenland. Treasury yields hit four-month highs, the dollar fell to a two-week low, and gold/silver surged to record highs—classic "Sell America" pattern.

## Why it happens

**Loss of safe-haven status:** When investors question US fiscal trajectory, political stability, or trade reliability, [[Treasuries]] stop being the automatic destination for scared capital.

**Foreign ownership vulnerability:** Foreigners hold ~30% of US [[Treasuries]] ($9.2T of $38T debt as of October 2025). Europe alone owns $8T in US equities and bonds—twice the rest of world combined (Deutsche Bank). When these flows reverse, all three assets move together.

**Major holders (Oct 2025):**

| Country   | Holdings | Share |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| [[Japan]] | $1.2T    | 12.4% |
| [[UK]]    | ~$750B   | 8.4%  |
| [[China]] | $759B    | 8.9%  |

China and Japan have been net sellers, typically <$10B/month. The risk is acceleration.

## Limitations and counterarguments

**Market depth:** The Treasury market is $30T. True diversification away from US assets is structurally difficult. As [[UBS]] CEO Sergio Ermotti put it: "Diversifying away from America is impossible."

**Flows returned:** After April 2025's panic, capital came back once tariff impact was recalibrated. The episode was "policy risk colliding with crowded positioning" more than permanent reallocation.

**Relative performance:** Despite the dollar's decline, US equities had a strong 2025. But 93% of countries in MSCI's global index outperformed the US in early 2026 (Barclays).

## Indicators: is the trade on?

### DXY / 10Y yield correlation

The key signal. Normally DXY and Treasury yields move together (~0.55 correlation in late 2025). When correlation **flips negative**—yields rising while dollar falls—the trade is on.

| Period         | DXY/10Y correlation | Status          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Late 2025      | ~0.55               | Normal          |
| May 2025       | Negative            | Trade on (brief)|
| April 2025     | Negative            | Trade on        |
| 2020-Q1 2021   | Negative            | Pandemic stress |

ECB confirmed the correlation "turned negative for a period after April 2, 2025"—first inversion since March-May 2022.

### Stock-bond correlation

Normally negative (bonds hedge equity drawdowns). When **both fall together**, 60/40 diversification fails.

| Period    | 12-month correlation | Interpretation              |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Jul 2024  | 0.80                 | Broken (inflation regime)   |
| Late 2025 | 0.16                 | Healing                     |
| Target    | < 0                  | Diversification working     |

36-month correlation eased from 0.66 (Dec 2024) to 0.48 (Sep 2025).

### Gold surge + dollar weakness

When gold/silver rally while DXY falls, capital is fleeing to hard assets rather than rotating within US markets. January 2026: gold/silver hit record highs as DXY dropped 1% in a day.

### Other indicators

- **TIC data** — monthly foreign Treasury holdings (lagged but definitive)
- **30-year yield** behavior during equity selloffs (should fall in normal risk-off)
- **Term premium** — rising compensation for duration risk

## Implications

**For portfolios:** Traditional 60/40 may not hedge as expected. The negative stock-bond correlation that underpinned decades of asset allocation is less reliable.

**For multinationals:** Dollar weakness helps exporters, hurts importers. But volatility itself is the problem—hard to hedge when correlations are unstable.

**For [[Treasuries]]:** Term premium may need to rise to compensate for episodic safe-haven doubt. Moody's downgrade (May 2025) reinforced this.
