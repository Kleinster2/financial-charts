# Sell America trade

The simultaneous selling of US equities, [[Treasuries]], and the dollar—a correlation break signaling capital leaving the US entirely rather than rotating to safety within US markets.

## Synthesis

The "Sell America" trade is a real phenomenon with a fragile foundation. It has fired twice — April 2025 (Liberation Day) and January 2026 (Greenland tariffs) — and both times the pattern was unmistakable: equities, Treasuries, and dollar all falling simultaneously. The DXY lost 9.6% in 2025, its worst year since 2017. 93% of countries outperformed the US in early 2026.

But the fundamental case for actually divesting from the US is weak. US companies generated $6.7T more revenue than European peers last year — $4.6T even excluding Big Tech. They invested $9T in R&D and capex over five years vs Europe's $4.7T. Europe's FCF margin catch-up came from *spending less*, not operating better — and consensus expects the US to pull further ahead through 2029 (8% revenue growth vs 6%, 13% FCF margin expansion vs 4%). [[UBS]] CEO Ermotti called full divestment a "dangerous bet."

The trade works as a *tactical signal* — when DXY and Treasury yields decouple (correlation flips negative), capital is leaving America and traditional 60/40 portfolios lose their hedge. It's worth monitoring and trading around. But as a *structural allocation shift*, it faces a $7T revenue gap, a $4.3T R&D investment gap, and a negative feedback loop where European underinvestment erodes the very fundamentals that would justify reallocation. Europe's edge is valuation (lower multiples) and yield (higher dividends) — real advantages, enough for [[BlackRock]] and [[UBS]] to project higher near-term returns. But the long-term trajectory of European business points in an unfavorable direction without fresh capital and policy reform.

**Watch for:** The trade re-fires on every new tariff threat, fiscal scare, or geopolitical provocation. The question isn't whether it happens again — it will — but whether it ever becomes *permanent* rather than episodic.

## What makes it distinctive

In normal risk-off episodes:
- Equities fall
- [[Treasuries]] **rally** (flight to safety)
- Dollar **strengthens** (safe haven)

The "Sell America" trade breaks this pattern:
- Equities fall
- [[Treasuries]] **also fall** (yields spike)
- Dollar **weakens**

This isn't "risk-off"—it's "get out of America." The traditional 60/40 portfolio loses its diversification benefit because the negative stock-bond correlation breaks down.

## April 2025: Liberation Day

The defining episode. On April 2, 2025, Trump announced sweeping tariffs ("Liberation Day"). The initial reaction was textbook flight-to-safety—investors bought [[Treasuries]]. Then everything reversed.

**The numbers:**
- 30-year yield: +50 bps in one week, biggest move since 1987
- 10-year yield: swung 53 bps in three days (3.87% → 4.49%), biggest since December 2001
- DXY: -10.7% in H1 2025, worst first-half in 50+ years
- DXY full-year 2025: -9.6%, worst annual decline since 2017

One Fed official attributed the Treasury spike partly to forced unwinding of the swap-spread trade. But the broader signal was unmistakable: [[Treasuries]] behaved "like a risky asset under pressure."

## January 2026: Greenland revival

The trade returned after Trump threatened tariffs on eight NATO countries over Greenland. Treasury yields hit four-month highs, the dollar fell to a two-week low, and gold/silver surged to record highs—classic "Sell America" pattern.

## Why it happens

**Loss of safe-haven status:** When investors question US fiscal trajectory, political stability, or trade reliability, [[Treasuries]] stop being the automatic destination for scared capital.

**Foreign ownership vulnerability:** Foreigners hold ~30% of US [[Treasuries]] ($9.2T of $38T debt as of October 2025). Europe alone owns $8T in US equities and bonds—twice the rest of world combined (Deutsche Bank). When these flows reverse, all three assets move together.

**Major holders (Oct 2025):**

| Country   | Holdings | Share |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| [[Japan]] | $1.2T    | 12.4% |
| [[UK]]    | ~$750B   | 8.4%  |
| [[China]] | $759B    | 8.9%  |

China and Japan have been net sellers, typically <$10B/month. The risk is acceleration.

## Limitations and counterarguments

**Market depth:** The Treasury market is $30T. True diversification away from US assets is structurally difficult. As [[UBS]] CEO Sergio Ermotti put it: "Diversifying away from America is impossible."

**Flows returned:** After April 2025's panic, capital came back once tariff impact was recalibrated. The episode was "policy risk colliding with crowded positioning" more than permanent reallocation.

**Relative performance:** Despite the dollar's decline, US equities had a strong 2025. But 93% of countries in MSCI's global index outperformed the US in early 2026 (Barclays).

## Indicators: is the trade on?

### DXY / 10Y yield correlation

The key signal. Normally DXY and Treasury yields move together (~0.55 correlation in late 2025). When correlation **flips negative**—yields rising while dollar falls—the trade is on.

| Period         | DXY/10Y correlation | Status          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Late 2025      | ~0.55               | Normal          |
| May 2025       | Negative            | Trade on (brief)|
| April 2025     | Negative            | Trade on        |
| 2020-Q1 2021   | Negative            | Pandemic stress |

ECB confirmed the correlation "turned negative for a period after April 2, 2025"—first inversion since March-May 2022.

### Stock-bond correlation

Normally negative (bonds hedge equity drawdowns). When **both fall together**, 60/40 diversification fails.

| Period    | 12-month correlation | Interpretation              |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Jul 2024  | 0.80                 | Broken (inflation regime)   |
| Late 2025 | 0.16                 | Healing                     |
| Target    | < 0                  | Diversification working     |

36-month correlation eased from 0.66 (Dec 2024) to 0.48 (Sep 2025).

### Gold surge + dollar weakness

When gold/silver rally while DXY falls, capital is fleeing to hard assets rather than rotating within US markets. January 2026: gold/silver hit record highs as DXY dropped 1% in a day.

### Other indicators

- **TIC data** — monthly foreign Treasury holdings (lagged but definitive)
- **30-year yield** behavior during equity selloffs (should fall in normal risk-off)
- **Term premium** — rising compensation for duration risk

## The $7T fundamental gap (Kaissar, Feb 2026)

Bloomberg Opinion (Nir Kaissar) made the fundamental case against "Sell America" — the US lead over Europe runs far deeper than Big Tech.

### Revenue and investment gap

| Metric | US | US ex Big Tech | Europe |
|--------|-----|----------------|--------|
| Revenue growth (5yr avg) | **8%/yr** | 7%/yr | 3%/yr |
| Revenue lead (FY2020) | +$3T | +$2T | — |
| Revenue lead (FY2025) | **+$6.7T** | +$4.6T | — |
| R&D + capex (5yr cumulative) | ~$9T | ~$7T | $4.7T |

Europe matched US FCF growth despite lower revenue growth — but only by expanding FCF margins 5%/yr while US margins stayed flat. That margin expansion came from *lower investment*, not superior efficiency.

### Forward estimates (consensus, FY2026-2029)

| Metric | US | Europe |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Revenue growth | **8%/yr** | 6%/yr |
| FCF margin growth | **13%/yr** | 4%/yr |
| Projected revenue lead | **+$10.5T** ($6.5T ex Big Tech) | — |
| Projected FCF lead | **+$2.1T** (~half from Big Tech) | — |

### The bull case for Europe anyway

| Factor | Europe edge |
|--------|------------|
| Dividend yield | Higher than US |
| Valuations | Lower, more room for expansion |
| Expectations | Easier to beat if fundamentals improve |
| [[BlackRock]], [[UBS]] | Both expect higher stock returns from Europe than US |

[[UBS]] CEO Sergio Ermotti: divesting from US is a "dangerous bet" given "highest level of innovation," but underweighting may work short-term.

### The negative feedback loop risk

Europe's modest margins and revenue growth leave less room for R&D investment. Without fresh capital, declining investment → deteriorating fundamentals → weaker case for future investment. This is the structural bear case for long-term Europe allocation.

European stock funds average US allocation: well below 50% (vs 63% of global market cap). Already underweight, but the gap may widen.

## Implications

**For portfolios:** Traditional 60/40 may not hedge as expected. The negative stock-bond correlation that underpinned decades of asset allocation is less reliable.

**For multinationals:** Dollar weakness helps exporters, hurts importers. But volatility itself is the problem—hard to hedge when correlations are unstable.

**For [[Treasuries]]:** Term premium may need to rise to compensate for episodic safe-haven doubt. Moody's downgrade (May 2025) reinforced this.
