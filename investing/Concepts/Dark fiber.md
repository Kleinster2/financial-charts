**Dark fiber** — Unused optical fiber strands leased or owned and "lit" by the customer using their own equipment. Full control over bandwidth, routing, and performance.

## Origin

Term emerged from 1990s telecom boom. Marginal cost of installing extra fiber during trenching was low → massive overbuild. After dot-com crash, unused capacity became "dark fiber." Now a strategic asset class.

## Why it matters

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Control** | Customer manages equipment, protocols, upgrades |
| **Scalability** | Light more wavelengths as demand grows |
| **Security** | Dedicated strands, no shared infrastructure |
| **Latency** | No provider routing overhead |
| **Cost at scale** | Cheaper than lit services for high-bandwidth users |

---

## Key applications

| Use case | Why dark fiber |
|----------|---------------|
| **Data center interconnects** | GPU clusters need massive, predictable bandwidth |
| **High-frequency trading** | Microsecond latency matters |
| **5G backhaul** | Each cell site needs 10-25 Gbps (10x vs 4G) |
| **AI training** | Low-latency GPU-to-GPU communication |
| **Enterprise WAN** | Private networks, data sovereignty |

## Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 market size | ~$8B |
| 2030-32 forecast | $15-18B |
| CAGR | 12-13% |
| Dominant region | North America (35% share) |

Growth driven by AI workloads, 5G densification, and shift from leased lit services to owned infrastructure.

## Key players

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Zayo | Private ([[DigitalBridge]]) | Largest US dark fiber provider; 125K+ route miles |
| Lumen Technologies | LUMN | Enterprise fiber networks |
| Crown Castle | CCI | Fiber + towers (selling fiber to Zayo) |
| Uniti Group | UNIT | Fiber REIT |
| [[Corning]] | GLW | Fiber manufacturing |

### Zayo + Crown Castle (March 2025)

[[DigitalBridge]] portfolio company Zayo acquiring Crown Castle's Fiber Solutions for **$4.25B**:
- Adds ~90,000 route miles → 215,000+ total
- 70,000+ on-net locations
- Metro fiber complements Zayo's long-haul network
- Close expected H1 2026

DigitalBridge-backed platforms collectively operate ~300,000 route miles of fiber across 550 markets.

## Dot-com comparison

The 1990s dark fiber overbuild became a cautionary tale — capacity built for demand that never materialized. Today's [[AI Infrastructure]] buildout invites the same question.

**Key difference:** Current demand is real and measurable (hyperscaler capex, GPU deployments, 5G rollout). As [[David Sacks]] noted: "No such thing as a dark GPU right now."

**Risk:** If AI capex slows or demand disappoints, history could rhyme.
