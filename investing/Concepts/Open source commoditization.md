Open source AI models have closed the gap with frontier proprietary models. This changes everything.

## The gap closure (Dec 2025)

| Metric | One year ago | Now |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| MMLU benchmark gap | 17.5 points | **0.3 points** |
| Price gap | 3-5x | **10-30x** |

## DeepSeek: the price destroyer

**DeepSeek-V3.2** achieves frontier performance at radical prices:

| Provider | Input/Output per 1M tokens |
|----------|---------------------------|
| GPT-5 | $30 / $60 |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $15 / $75 |
| **DeepSeek-V3.2** | **$0.27 / $1.10** |

10-30x cheaper. MIT license. Self-hostable.

**Competition wins:**
- IMO 2025 Gold Medal
- IOI 2025 Gold Medal
- ICPC World Finals 2nd place

Open source is now *beating* proprietary on specialized tasks.

## What proprietary models still have

- Consistency and polish
- Tool integration (function calling, etc.)
- Ecosystem (ChatGPT's distribution)
- Brand trust for enterprise

**Not enough to justify 10-30x premium** for most use cases.

## Trade implications

**Bearish:**
- [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]] — pricing power eroding
- API-only businesses — race to zero margin
- "AI revenue growth" stories — check the margins

**Bullish:**
- Infrastructure (chips, memory) — all models need compute
- Self-hosting/on-prem — enterprises want to own their AI
- Hyperscalers — can offer AI as loss leader, monetize elsewhere

---

## The new equilibrium

**Intelligent routing** becomes standard:
- Frontier models for quality-critical decisions
- Open source for high-volume, cost-sensitive tasks
- Self-hosted for privacy-sensitive workloads

No single provider wins. Commoditization is the outcome.

---

## Key players to watch

- **DeepSeek** (China) — efficiency focus, 10-30x cheaper
- **Mistral** (Europe) — open-weight, enterprise focus
- **GLM** (China) — new SOTA for coding (Dec 2025)
- **Llama** (Meta) — open source from a hyperscaler
