**Copper smelter squeeze** — The structural crisis at the smelter layer of the copper value chain, where treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) have collapsed into negative territory, signaling a severe global shortage of copper concentrate. This is the "pinch point" the market is missing in the [[Copper for AI]] thesis.

---

## The value chain

The market sees "copper" as one thing. It's actually two distinct businesses with different fundamentals:

| Step | Process | Output | Purity |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Mining | Dig up 0.25-1% ore, crush, froth flotation | Concentrate ("powder") | ~30% Cu |
| Smelting & refining | Furnace → matte → blister → electrorefine | Cathode | 99.99% Cu |

**TC/RCs** (Treatment & Refining Charges) are the fee miners pay smelters to process concentrate. They are the price signal for the health of the entire system.

---

## The collapse

| Year | TC/RC benchmark | Context |
|------|----------------|---------|
| 2024 | **$80/tonne** | Comfortable, smelters profitable |
| 2025 | **$21.25/tonne** | -73%, structural tightening |
| 2025 spot | **Negative** | Smelters *paying miners* for concentrate |

The China Smelter Purchase Team (CSPT) failed to set quarterly guidance for consecutive quarters — there is no price at which the math works for smelters.

**This is not cyclical.** The concentrate market was already in deficit before [[Freeport-McMoRan|Grasberg]] and before AI demand arrived.

---

## Why the squeeze happened

### Demand side — Chinese smelter overcapacity
Chinese smelters (Jiangxi, Tongling, etc.) expanded capacity massively, assuming a wave of mine supply that never arrived. They are the primary bidders in a desperate war for concentrate. Their overcapacity guarantees the price war.

### Supply side — concentrate removed from merchant market

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| [[First Quantum Minerals\|Cobre Panamá]] shutdown (late 2023) | 300K+ tpa offline, structural hole |
| Grasberg mudslide (Sep 2025) | 2.5% of global mine supply offline until 2027 |
| **Shadow integration** | Freeport (Gresik smelter, 1.7M tpa) + [[Ivanhoe Mines]]/Zijin (Kamoa, 500K tpa) building own smelters — permanently removing 2M+ tonnes of concentrate from the open market |

The "shadow integration" is structural: miners who were the largest sellers of concentrate to Chinese/Japanese/European smelters are now consuming their own material.

**Global copper concentrate deficit: 1.2M tonnes** (ICBC Standard Bank). [[China]] is 80% reliant on concentrate imports.

---

## The misleading "surplus" narrative

| What the market sees | What's actually happening |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| China refined output at records (Jun 2025) | Smelters operating at negative margins |
| Weak downstream operating rates | Local governments propping up employment |
| Looks like surplus | Smelters subsidized by government + by-product revenues (gold, silver, sulfuric acid) |

The market is looking at the wrong layer. Downstream appears loose; the concentrate-to-cathode link is in systemic crisis.

## The Great Strategic Pivot

Japanese and European smelters have concluded the primary business is **structurally broken** and are permanently re-tooling:

| Smelter | Action |
|---------|--------|
| [[Aurubis]] (Europe's largest) | $800M U.S. recycling plant in Richmond, GA (opened Sep 2025) |
| JX Advanced Metals (TSE: 5016) | Cutting cathode production, citing concentrate shortage |
| Mitsubishi Materials (TSE: 5711) | Scaling down concentrate at Onahama, pivoting to e-scrap |
| Sumitomo Metal Mining (TSE: 5713) | Building LIB recycling capacity at Toyo smelter (Jun 2026) |

This **guarantees less primary smelter capacity** in the future, even if new mines come online. The pivot is permanent, not cyclical.

---

## The inverted bullwhip

The supply chain is contracting at the base (smelters cutting) while expanding at the end (cable OEMs have record backlogs):

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Smelters** | Cutting production, pivoting to recycling |
| **Cable OEMs** | [[Nexans]] +33% HV growth, [[NKT]] record backlog, [[Prysmian]] acquired Encore Wire |
| **DC power** | [[Schneider Electric]] double-digit growth in data center segment |
| **Grid connectors** | [[Hubbell]] acquired DMC Power for $825M |

This is physically unsustainable. The pinch at the smelter must propagate → dramatically higher prices for physical metal. Cable OEMs with record backlogs will be price-takers, passing costs to utilities and data centers who cannot stop building.

---

## Investment implications

The asymmetric bet:
1. **Demand:** Non-linear, non-cyclical, non-substitutable (AI + electrification)
2. **Supply:** Already in structural failure at the smelter layer
3. **Physics:** Density and thermal requirements lock in copper (see [[Copper for AI]])

**Winners by layer:**
- **Miners:** Concentrate producers with contracted offtake — [[Freeport-McMoRan]], [[Southern Copper]], [[Ivanhoe Mines]]
- **Integrated miners:** Those building own smelters capture full margin
- **Recyclers:** [[Aurubis]] leading the pivot to "urban mining"
- **Cable OEMs:** [[Prysmian]], [[Nexans]], [[NKT]] — record backlogs, price-takers for cathode
- **DC power:** [[Schneider Electric]], Legrand — copper-dense by necessity
- **Grid:** [[Hubbell]] — "picks and shovels" of U.S. grid
