**Accounting primer** — foundational financial statement and accounting concepts for company analysis. Understanding accounting helps evaluate earnings quality, detect red flags, and compare companies properly.

> **Key insight:** Earnings are an opinion, cash is a fact. Accounting rules give companies significant discretion. The gap between reported earnings and actual cash generation reveals a lot about management quality and business economics.

## The three financial statements

```
Income Statement: Did you make money this period?
         ↓
Balance Sheet: What do you own and owe right now?
         ↓
Cash Flow Statement: Where did the cash actually go?
```

All three connect. Net income flows to retained earnings (balance sheet). Cash flow reconciles net income to actual cash.

## Income statement

**Revenue → Expenses → Profit**

```
Revenue (Sales)
− Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
− Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D)
= Operating Income (EBIT)
− Interest Expense
= Pre-tax Income
− Taxes
= Net Income
```

### Key metrics

| Metric | Formula | What it measures |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Gross margin** | Gross profit / Revenue | Pricing power, production efficiency |
| **Operating margin** | EBIT / Revenue | Core business profitability |
| **Net margin** | Net income / Revenue | Bottom-line profitability |
| **EBITDA margin** | EBITDA / Revenue | Cash proxy (flawed) |

### Revenue recognition

**When does a sale count?**

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Contract exists | Agreement with customer |
| Performance obligation | What you promised to deliver |
| Price determinable | Know what you'll receive |
| Delivery/performance | Substantially complete |

**Red flag:** Revenue recognized before cash received or delivery complete. Watch accounts receivable growth vs revenue growth.

### Expense recognition (matching)

Expenses matched to the revenue they generate.

| Item | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Capitalize** | Spread cost over useful life (assets) |
| **Expense** | Recognize immediately (period cost) |

**Manipulation opportunity:** Capitalize costs that should be expensed → inflate current earnings.

---

## Balance sheet

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity** (always)

### Assets (what you own)

| Category | Examples | Liquidity |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Current assets** | Cash, receivables, inventory | <1 year |
| **Non-current assets** | PP&E, intangibles, goodwill | >1 year |

### Liabilities (what you owe)

| Category | Examples | Due |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Current liabilities** | Payables, short-term debt, deferred revenue | <1 year |
| **Non-current liabilities** | Long-term debt, lease obligations, pensions | >1 year |

### Equity (residual)

```
Equity = Assets − Liabilities
       = Common stock + Retained earnings + AOCI
```

### Key balance sheet metrics

| Metric | Formula | What it measures |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Current ratio** | Current assets / Current liabilities | Short-term liquidity |
| **Quick ratio** | (Current assets − Inventory) / Current liabilities | Immediate liquidity |
| **Debt/Equity** | Total debt / Equity | Leverage |
| **Debt/EBITDA** | Total debt / EBITDA | Debt capacity |

---

## Cash flow statement

Reconciles net income to actual cash.

### Three sections

| Section | Shows |
|---------|-------|
| **Operating** | Cash from core business |
| **Investing** | Capex, acquisitions, asset sales |
| **Financing** | Debt, equity, dividends |

### Operating cash flow (indirect method)

```
Net Income
+ Depreciation/Amortization (non-cash expense)
+ Stock-based compensation (non-cash)
± Changes in working capital
  − Increase in receivables (sold but not collected)
  − Increase in inventory (bought but not sold)
  + Increase in payables (received but not paid)
= Cash from Operations (CFO)
```

### Free cash flow

```
Free Cash Flow = CFO − Capex

Or (unlevered):
UFCF = EBIT × (1 − tax rate) + D&A − Capex − ∆Working Capital
```

**Why FCF matters:** What's left after maintaining the business. Available for dividends, buybacks, debt paydown, M&A.

## Key accounting concepts

### Accrual vs cash basis

| Basis | Revenue recognized | Expense recognized |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Accrual** | When earned | When incurred |
| **Cash** | When received | When paid |

GAAP requires accrual accounting. Creates timing differences between earnings and cash.

### Depreciation and amortization

**Depreciation:** Spreading cost of tangible assets over useful life.

| Method | Pattern | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Straight-line | Equal each year | Most common |
| Accelerated | More early, less later | Tax benefit |
| Units of production | Based on usage | Manufacturing |

**Amortization:** Same concept for intangible assets (patents, software).

**Not cash:** D&A is added back in cash flow statement. Real cash was spent when asset was purchased.

### Goodwill

```
Goodwill = Purchase price − Fair value of net assets acquired
```

Created only through acquisitions. Represents "overpayment" for synergies, brand, etc.

**Impairment:** If acquired business underperforms, goodwill written down. Non-cash charge but reveals overpayment.

**Red flag:** Large goodwill relative to equity. Serial acquirers with growing goodwill.

---

## Earnings quality

Not all earnings are equal. Higher quality = more sustainable, more cash-backed.

### Quality indicators

| High quality | Low quality |
|--------------|-------------|
| CFO > Net income | CFO < Net income |
| Stable margins | Volatile margins |
| Low accruals | High accruals |
| Conservative accounting | Aggressive accounting |
| Cash revenue | Receivables growth |

### Accruals

```
Accruals = Net Income − Cash from Operations
```

High accruals = earnings not backed by cash. Studies show high-accrual companies underperform.

### Red flags

| Red flag | What it suggests |
|----------|------------------|
| Revenue growing faster than receivables | Good |
| Receivables growing faster than revenue | **Bad — stuffing channels?** |
| Inventory growing faster than sales | **Bad — obsolescence risk** |
| Capitalized costs growing | **Bad — hiding expenses?** |
| CFO persistently below net income | **Bad — low quality earnings** |
| Frequent "one-time" charges | **Bad — recurring "non-recurring"** |
| Changing accounting policies | **Bad — hiding deterioration** |

---

## Non-GAAP metrics

Companies report "adjusted" earnings excluding certain items.

| Common adjustment | Rationale | Skepticism |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Stock-based comp | Non-cash | But real dilution |
| Restructuring | One-time | But recurring for serial restructurers |
| Amortization of intangibles | Non-cash | But real acquisition cost |
| Acquisition costs | One-time | But recurring for serial acquirers |

**Rule:** Compare GAAP to non-GAAP over time. Growing gap = red flag.

### EBITDA problems

EBITDA is **not** free cash flow.

```
EBITDA ignores:
− Interest (real cash cost)
− Taxes (real cash cost)
− Capex (real cash cost)
− Working capital (real cash need)
```

**Quote (Charlie Munger):** "I think that every time you see EBITDA, you should substitute 'bullshit earnings.'"

**When EBITDA is useful:** Comparing companies with different capital structures, debt levels, depreciation policies. But never as a cash proxy.

---

## Working capital

```
Working Capital = Current Assets − Current Liabilities

Or (operating):
Operating WC = Receivables + Inventory − Payables
```

### Cash conversion cycle

```
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): Receivables / (Revenue/365)
Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): Inventory / (COGS/365)
Days Payables Outstanding (DPO): Payables / (COGS/365)

Cash Conversion Cycle = DSO + DIO − DPO
```

**Negative CCC:** Collect from customers before paying suppliers. [[Amazon]], [[Costco]]. Capital-efficient.

**Positive CCC:** Finance the gap between paying suppliers and collecting from customers. Requires working capital.

---

## Stock-based compensation

**Non-cash expense, but real cost to shareholders.**

```
Company issues stock → Employee gets compensation → Shareholders diluted
```

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| "Non-cash, add back" | But dilution is real |
| "Aligns incentives" | But can be excessive |

**What to watch:**
- SBC as % of revenue (tech companies: 10-30% common)
- Share count over time (growing = dilution)
- SBC vs repurchases (net dilution?)

---

## Segment reporting

Large companies report by business segment.

| Required disclosure | Use |
|---------------------|-----|
| Revenue by segment | Where growth is coming from |
| Operating income by segment | Which businesses are profitable |
| Assets by segment | [[Capital allocation]] |

**Conglomerate discount:** Markets value transparent, focused businesses higher than opaque conglomerates.

---

## Consolidation

### Subsidiaries (>50% owned)

Fully consolidated — all revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities included. Minority interest shown separately.

### Equity method (20-50% owned)

Only proportional share of net income included. Investment shown as single line on balance sheet.

### Financial investments (<20%)

Mark to market (trading) or at cost (held to maturity).

## Lease accounting (ASC 842)

**Operating leases now on balance sheet** (since 2019).

| Item | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Right-of-use asset | Asset (present value of lease payments) |
| Lease liability | Liability (same) |

**Impact:** Increased reported assets and liabilities. Debt/equity ratios rose for retailers, airlines.

---

## Auditor opinions

| Opinion | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Unqualified** | Clean bill of health |
| **Qualified** | Clean except for specific issue |
| **Adverse** | Statements don't fairly represent |
| **Disclaimer** | Auditor couldn't form opinion |

**Red flags:** Anything other than unqualified. Auditor changes. Late filings.
