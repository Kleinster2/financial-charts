**US dollar** — World's primary reserve currency (~60% of global reserves). [[Benchmark]] for commodities, trade, and debt. Weakened in 2025 as Fed cut rates and independence concerns emerged.

---

## Current status (Jan 28, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DXY (dollar index) | **96.16** (4-year low) |
| 2025 return | **-9%** (DXY basis) |
| Jan 2026 MTD | **-2.5%** |
| Fed rate | 3.50-3.75% (held) |
| 10Y Treasury | ~4.5% |
| Gold | **$5,300+** (record) |

**Jan 24-28 selloff:** DXY fell 2.26% in 5 days after NY Fed "rate check" and Trump endorsement of weakness.

---

## Jan 2026 selloff

**Catalyst:** NY Fed conducted rare "rate check" with currency traders on USD/JPY (Jan 24) — reportedly at [[Treasury]]'s request. Markets interpreted this as possible coordinated intervention to weaken the dollar.

**Trump endorsement:** When asked about the decline, Trump said "I think it's great" — removing any expectation of policy pushback.

| Currency | Move |
|----------|------|
| EUR | Topped $1.20 (first since 2021) |
| GBP | 4.5-year highs |
| JPY | Best month vs USD since April |
| Gold | $5,300+ record (+22% YTD) |

---

## Why USD weakened in 2025

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Fed cutting cycle** | 175bp of cuts narrowed rate advantage |
| **Fed independence fears** | DOJ investigation of Powell → safe haven concern |
| **Twin deficits** | Fiscal + current account deficits |
| **De-dollarization** | Central banks diversifying reserves |
| **Risk-on environment** | Money flows to EM, commodities |

## Dollar smile theory

USD tends to strengthen in two scenarios:

```
Strong USD          Weak USD           Strong USD
    |                  |                   |
    v                  v                   v
[Risk off]  <---> [Goldilocks] <---> [US outperformance]
 (flight to          (carry to           (growth
  safety)             EM/risk)           differential)
```

Jan 2026: Middle of the smile — but political factors (rate check, Trump endorsement) pushing weakness beyond fundamentals.

---

## Fed independence impact

Unprecedented: DOJ subpoenas of Fed officials in Jan 2026.

| Scenario | USD impact |
|----------|------------|
| Fed independence preserved | Neutral/supportive |
| Political pressure succeeds | Bearish (credibility loss) |
| Fed chair replaced | Very bearish |

**El-Erian:** "Price of gold indicates at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

---

## Reserve currency status

| Currency | % of reserves | Trend |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| USD | ~58% | Slowly declining |
| EUR | ~20% | Stable |
| JPY | ~5% | Stable |
| GBP | ~5% | Stable |
| CNY | ~2.5% | Rising slowly |
| Gold | Rising | Structural shift |

**Key stat:** First time since 1996, gold > [[Treasuries]] in CB reserves.

---

**Positive for USD:**
- Deepest, most liquid markets
