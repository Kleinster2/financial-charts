**US dollar** — World's primary reserve currency (~60% of global reserves). [[Benchmark]] for commodities, trade, and debt. Weakened in 2025 as Fed cut rates and independence concerns emerged.

---

## Current status (Jan 30, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DXY (dollar index) | **~97** (rebounding from 4-year low) |
| 2025 return | **-9%** (DXY basis) |
| Jan 2026 MTD | **-2%** |
| Fed rate | 3.50-3.75% (held) |
| 10Y Treasury | 4.25% |
| Gold | **~$5,150** (down from record) |

**Jan 24-28 selloff:** DXY fell 2.26% in 5 days after NY Fed "rate check" and Trump endorsement of weakness.

**Jan 30 rebound:** Dollar rallied on [[Kevin Warsh]] nomination — markets saw credible, independent choice for Fed Chair.

---

## Jan 2026 selloff

**Catalyst:** NY Fed conducted rare "rate check" with currency traders on USD/JPY (Jan 24) — reportedly at [[Treasury]]'s request. Markets interpreted this as possible coordinated intervention to weaken the dollar.

**Trump endorsement:** When asked about the decline, Trump said "I think it's great" — removing any expectation of policy pushback.

| Currency | Move |
|----------|------|
| EUR | Topped $1.20 (first since 2021) |
| GBP | 4.5-year highs |
| JPY | Best month vs USD since April |
| Gold | $5,300+ record (+22% YTD) |

---

## Why USD weakened in 2025

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Fed cutting cycle** | 175bp of cuts narrowed rate advantage |
| **Fed independence fears** | DOJ investigation of Powell → safe haven concern |
| **Twin deficits** | Fiscal + current account deficits |
| **De-dollarization** | Central banks diversifying reserves |
| **Risk-on environment** | Money flows to EM, commodities |

## Dollar smile theory

USD tends to strengthen in two scenarios:

```
Strong USD          Weak USD           Strong USD
    |                  |                   |
    v                  v                   v
[Risk off]  <---> [Goldilocks] <---> [US outperformance]
 (flight to          (carry to           (growth
  safety)             EM/risk)           differential)
```

Jan 2026: Middle of the smile — but political factors (rate check, Trump endorsement) pushing weakness beyond fundamentals.

## Fed independence impact

Unprecedented: DOJ subpoenas of Fed officials in Jan 2026.

| Scenario | USD impact | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Fed independence preserved | Neutral/supportive | — |
| Political pressure succeeds | Bearish (credibility loss) | Jan 14-28 selloff |
| **Credible Fed chair named** | **Bullish** | **Jan 30 Warsh → rally** |
| Dovish Fed chair named | Very bearish | — |

**El-Erian:** "Price of gold indicates at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

### Warsh nomination rebound (Jan 30)

Dollar reversed when Trump nominated [[Kevin Warsh]] — a former Fed Governor with [[Morgan Stanley]] background, seen as more credible/independent than alternatives like [[Kevin Hassett]].

**BMO:** "By selecting Warsh, the Administration has clearly offered a nod to the necessity of Fed credibility."

## Reserve currency status

| Currency | % of reserves | Trend |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| USD | ~58% | Slowly declining |
| EUR | ~20% | Stable |
| JPY | ~5% | Stable |
| GBP | ~5% | Stable |
| CNY | ~2.5% | Rising slowly |
| Gold | Rising | Structural shift |

**Key stat:** First time since 1996, gold > [[Treasuries]] in CB reserves.

---

## Structural factors

**Positive for USD:**
- Deepest, most liquid markets
- US growth outperformance
- Safe haven in crisis
- Petrodollar system
- [[Network effects]] (invoicing, debt)

**Negative for USD:**
- Twin deficits ($2T+ fiscal)
- De-dollarization trend
- Political interference risk
- Weaponization of dollar (sanctions)

## Dollar as global credit supply

[[Hyun Song Shin]]'s research at [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] shows the dollar isn't just about competitiveness — it's a **credit supply variable**.

**Traditional view:** Strong dollar → US imports cheaper, exports pricier → trade adjusts via price competitiveness

**Shin's view:** Strong dollar → dollar credit tightens globally → working capital for [[Global Value Chains|GVCs]] gets expensive → supply chains contract

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| ~80% of trade finance is dollar-denominated | BIS CGFS |
| Exporters reliant on dollar credit suffer more when dollar rises | Bruno & Shin (2019) |
| GVC length is determined by financing costs, not just labor arbitrage | Kim & Shin (2023) |

**Implication:** The broad dollar index (DXY) is a proxy for **global financial conditions**. Fed tightening transmits to world trade through the working capital channel — even trade between non-US countries contracts when the dollar strengthens.

This explains why:
- Trade volumes fall when dollar rises (even for non-US pairs)
- GVCs shorten during financial stress
- "Reshoring" accelerates when dollar funding is scarce

## Key levels (DXY)

| Level | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| 90 | 2020-2021 lows |
| **96** | **Current (Jan 2026)** — 4-year low |
| 100 | Psychological support (broken) |
| 105 | 2023-2024 range |
| 114 | 2022 high (peak hawkishness) |
