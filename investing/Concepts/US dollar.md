**US dollar** — World's primary reserve currency (~60% of global reserves). Benchmark for commodities, trade, and debt. Weakened in 2025 as Fed cut rates and independence concerns emerged.

---

## Current status (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DXY (dollar index) | ~98 |
| 2025 return | **-10%** (DXY basis) |
| Fed rate | 3.50-3.75% |
| 10Y Treasury | ~4.5% |

---

## Why USD weakened in 2025

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Fed cutting cycle** | 200bp of cuts narrowed rate advantage |
| **Fed independence fears** | DOJ investigation of Powell → safe haven concern |
| **Twin deficits** | Fiscal + current account deficits |
| **De-dollarization** | Central banks diversifying reserves |
| **Risk-on environment** | Money flows to EM, commodities |

## Dollar smile theory

USD tends to strengthen in two scenarios:

```
Strong USD          Weak USD           Strong USD
    |                  |                   |
    v                  v                   v
[Risk off]  <---> [Goldilocks] <---> [US outperformance]
 (flight to          (carry to           (growth
  safety)             EM/risk)           differential)
```

2025: Middle of the smile (risk-on, carry trades working).

## Fed independence impact

Unprecedented: DOJ subpoenas of Fed officials in Jan 2026.

| Scenario | USD impact |
|----------|------------|
| Fed independence preserved | Neutral/supportive |
| Political pressure succeeds | Bearish (credibility loss) |
| Fed chair replaced | Very bearish |

**El-Erian:** "Price of gold indicates at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

| EUR | ~20% | Stable |
| JPY | ~5% | Stable |
