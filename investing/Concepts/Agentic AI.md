# Agentic AI

[[AI agents]] that can take actions, use tools, and complete multi-step tasks autonomously. The next wave after chatbots.

---

## Why agents are different

| Chatbots | Agents |
|----------|--------|
| Answer questions | Complete tasks |
| Single turn | Multi-step workflows |
| Human does the work | Agent does the work |
| Fuzzy ROI | Measurable output |

**Key insight**: Agents can actually DO work, not just talk about it. This changes the ROI equation.

## Market size (Dec 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 market | $7.9B |
| 2034 projected | $236B |
| 2024 startup funding | $3.8B (3x prior year) |
| [[Gartner]] 2026 prediction | 40% of enterprise apps will have agents (up from <5%) |

---

## Adoption signals

- **35%** of organizations already using agentic AI
- **44%** more planning to deploy soon
- **79%** say agents being adopted in their companies
- **66%** of adopters seeing measurable value
- **88%** planning budget increases for agentic AI
- **171%** average projected ROI

## Where agents work

**Strong use cases:**
- **Coding** — [[Claude]] Code, Devin, [[Cursor]] (clear output, measurable)
- **Customer service** — Handling tickets, routing, resolution
- **Data analysis** — Gathering, processing, reporting
- **Sales/SDR** — Outreach, qualification, scheduling
- **IT operations** — Monitoring, incident response

**Weaker use cases:**
- Open-ended strategy
- Creative work requiring taste
- High-stakes decisions (legal, medical)

## Key players

| Company | Product | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [[Anthropic]] | [[Claude]] Code | Production, proven |
| **[[Meta]]** | **Manus** | **Acquired Jan 2026 (~$2B+)** |
| [[Cognition]] Labs | Devin | $4B valuation, [[Goldman Sachs]] pilot |
| GitHub | Copilot | Production, 77M+ developers |
| [[OpenAI]] | GPT agents, Operator | Expanding |
| [[Salesforce]] | Agentforce | Enterprise focus |

**Meta/Manus acquisition (Jan 2026):**
- ~$2B+ deal — Meta's 3rd largest ever
- Chinese-founded, "hailed as the next [[DeepSeek]]"
- ~100 staff, general-purpose autonomous agent
- Alexandr Wang (ex-[[Scale AI]]) now leading Meta AI
- Signals agents becoming strategic priority for hyperscalers

---

## The Devin example

- [[Goldman Sachs]] piloting alongside 12,000 human developers
- Devin 2.0: $20/month (down from $500)
- Reality check: completes ~15% of complex tasks without assistance
- Best for: defined, contained projects — not open-ended development

**Pattern**: Agents augment, not replace. Human-in-the-loop still needed.

---

## Consolidation wave

Agents now strategic enough that hyperscalers are acquiring rather than building:
- [[Meta]] → Manus ($2B+, Jan 2026)
- [[Google]] → Windsurf team ($2.4B acqui-hire)
- Expect more: [[Amazon]], [[Microsoft]] watching

**Implication for startups:** Exit path is acquisition, not IPO. Build something strategic and get bought.

---

## Infrastructure stack

> **For the full competitive landscape of agent infrastructure → see [[Agent harnesses]]**

Three layers: **Runtime** (LangGraph) → **Framework** (LangChain, AutoGen) → **Harness** ([[Claude]] Code, Codex, [[Cursor]], Devin)

"2025 was agents. 2026 is agent harnesses." The harness layer is where competitive moats form and value accrues.

---

## [[Trade]] implications

**Bullish:**
- Agent infrastructure (model providers, orchestration)
- Coding tools specifically (proven category)
- [[Anthropic]] — [[Claude]] Code is an agent play
- Enterprise software with agent integration

**Watch:**
- Pure-play agent startups (high burn, unproven unit economics)
- Automation vendors being disrupted
- Chinese AI talent brain drain to US

**The thesis:**
Agents are the application layer that makes AI useful. Chatbots had fuzzy ROI. Agents do actual work with measurable output.

---

## Relationship to other concepts

- [[Agent harnesses]] — infrastructure layer (where moats form)
- [[Enterprise AI adoption]] — Agents are the exception to "95% fail"
- [[Model lab economics]] — Agent products ([[Claude]] Code) drive enterprise revenue
- [[Inference economics]] — Agents consume lots of inference (bullish compute)

---

## Open questions

- Can agent startups build moats, or do model providers/hyperscalers win?
- Will agents commoditize like inference?
- How fast does reliability improve?
- When do agents replace vs augment workers?
- Will US-[[China]] tensions block more acquisitions like Manus?
