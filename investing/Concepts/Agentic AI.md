# Agentic AI

AI agents that can take actions, use tools, and complete multi-step tasks autonomously. The next wave after chatbots.

---

## Why agents are different

| Chatbots | Agents |
|----------|--------|
| Answer questions | Complete tasks |
| Single turn | Multi-step workflows |
| Human does the work | Agent does the work |
| Fuzzy ROI | Measurable output |

**Key insight**: Agents can actually DO work, not just talk about it. This changes the ROI equation.

## Market size (Dec 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 market | $7.9B |
| 2034 projected | $236B |
| 2024 startup funding | $3.8B (3x prior year) |
| Gartner 2026 prediction | 40% of enterprise apps will have agents (up from <5%) |

## Adoption signals

- **35%** of organizations already using agentic AI
- **44%** more planning to deploy soon
- **79%** say agents being adopted in their companies
- **66%** of adopters seeing measurable value
- **88%** planning budget increases for agentic AI
- **171%** average projected ROI

## Where agents work

**Strong use cases:**
- **Coding** — Claude Code, Devin, Cursor (clear output, measurable)
- **Customer service** — Handling tickets, routing, resolution
- **Data analysis** — Gathering, processing, reporting
- **Sales/SDR** — Outreach, qualification, scheduling
- **IT operations** — Monitoring, incident response

**Weaker use cases:**
- Open-ended strategy
- Creative work requiring taste
- High-stakes decisions (legal, medical)

## Key players

| Company | Product | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Anthropic | Claude Code | Production, proven |
| Cognition Labs | Devin | $4B valuation, Goldman Sachs pilot |
| GitHub | Copilot | Production, 77M+ developers |
| OpenAI | GPT agents, Operator | Expanding |
| Salesforce | Agentforce | Enterprise focus |

## The Devin example

- Goldman Sachs piloting alongside 12,000 human developers
- Devin 2.0: $20/month (down from $500)
- Reality check: completes ~15% of complex tasks without assistance
- Best for: defined, contained projects — not open-ended development

**Pattern**: Agents augment, not replace. Human-in-the-loop still needed.

---

## Trade implications

**Bullish:**
- Agent infrastructure (model providers, orchestration)
- Coding tools specifically (proven category)
- [[Anthropic]] — Claude Code is an agent play
- Enterprise software with agent integration

**Watch:**
- Pure-play agent startups (high burn, unproven unit economics)
- Automation vendors being disrupted

**The thesis:**
Agents are the application layer that makes AI useful. Chatbots had fuzzy ROI. Agents do actual work with measurable output.

## Relationship to other concepts

- [[Enterprise AI adoption]] — Agents are the exception to "95% fail"
- [[Model lab economics]] — Agent products (Claude Code) drive enterprise revenue
- [[Inference economics]] — Agents consume lots of inference (bullish compute)

---

## Open questions

- Can agent startups build moats, or do model providers win?
- Will agents commoditize like inference?
- How fast does reliability improve?
- When do agents replace vs augment workers?
