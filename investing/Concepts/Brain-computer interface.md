**Brain-computer interface (BCI)** — Technology that enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. A $2-3B market (2025) growing 15%+ annually, with ~90 active clinical trials.

---

## Why it matters

**Restoring lost function.** BCIs can give paralyzed patients the ability to type, control devices, and potentially walk again via [[Rehabilitation robotics|exoskeletons]]. First-generation medical BCIs are now FDA-cleared and in human trials.

**Platform for AI integration.** Synchron integrated OpenAI in July 2024; OpenAI led $250M into Merger Labs (2025). Apple announced BCI Human Interface Device protocol (May 2025). The brain is becoming another input device.

**Long-term:** Memory enhancement, cognitive augmentation, brain-to-brain communication. Speculative but driving VC interest.

## Market overview

| Metric | 2025 | 2033-35E | CAGR |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| BCI market | $2.1-2.9B | $8.7-13.9B | 15-17% |

**Regional dominance:** North America leads (Neuralink, Synchron, Paradromics). [[China]] emerging with state-backed programs.

**Clinical trials:** ~90 active trials testing BCIs for typing, mobility, stroke rehab, speech restoration (as of June 2025).

## Technology approaches

| Type | Method | Signal quality | Risk | Example |
|------|--------|----------------|------|---------|
| **Invasive** | Electrodes implanted in brain (craniotomy) | Highest | Highest | [[Neuralink]], Blackrock |
| **Partially invasive** | Endovascular (via blood vessels) | Medium-high | Medium | Synchron |
| **Non-invasive** | EEG, fNIRS, MEG wearables | Lower | Lowest | Emotiv, Neurable |

**Trade-off:** More invasive = better signal quality and performance, but higher surgical risk and regulatory hurdles.

## Applications

| Use case | Status | Key players |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Cursor/device control** | In trials | Neuralink, Synchron, Blackrock |
| **Typing/communication** | In trials (90 char/min achieved) | Blackrock, Paradromics |
| **Speech restoration** | Early trials | Paradromics (ALS focus) |
| **Exoskeleton control** | Commercial | Cyberdyne HAL (uses EMG/brain signals) |
| **Gaming/wellness** | Consumer products | Emotiv, Neurable |
| **Vision restoration** | Future | Neuralink (stated goal) |
| **Memory enhancement** | Speculative | — |

## Connection to rehabilitation robotics

Cyberdyne's HAL exoskeleton (see [[Rehabilitation robotics]]) uses brain signals detected through skin surface to anticipate motor intent. This is a practical BCI application already in clinical use — the exoskeleton moves *before* the patient's muscles fully engage, assisting natural movement.

**Pipeline:** BCI → detect intent → exoskeleton executes → patient rehabilitates → potentially regains function.

## 2025 milestones

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Apr 2025 | Precision Layer 7 FDA 510(k) clearance |
| May 2025 | Apple announces BCI Human Interface Device protocol |
| Jun 2025 | Neuralink: 5 patients using device daily |
| Jun 2025 | ~90 active BCI clinical trials globally |
| Mar 2025 | Synchron-NVIDIA neural processing partnership |

## Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Longevity** | Implants degrade; scar tissue forms around electrodes |
| **Safety** | Infection risk, thread retraction (Neuralink's first patient had 85% detachment) |
| **Regulatory** | FDA pathway still evolving; full approval years away |
| **Cost** | Surgical implantation expensive; reimbursement unclear |
| **Bandwidth** | Even 1,024 channels is tiny vs 86B neurons |
| **Ethics** | Privacy (reading thoughts), identity, access inequality |

## Investment landscape

### Private companies

| Company | Valuation | Last raise |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| [[Neuralink]] | $9B | $600M (2025) |
| Synchron | ~$500M+ | — |
| Paradromics | — | $33M (Series B) |
| Precision Neuroscience | — | $41M (Series B) |

### Key investors

| Investor | Bets |
|----------|------|
| [[Founders Fund]] | Neuralink |
| ARCH Venture Partners | Synchron |
| Gates/Bezos | Synchron |
| OpenAI | Merger Labs ($250M) |
| [[NVIDIA]] | Synchron partnership |

### Public exposure

Limited — most BCI companies are private. Indirect plays:
- [[NVIDIA]] — neural processing partnership
- Medtech giants (if they acquire BCI startups)

---

## Investment case

**Bull:**
- FDA pathway clearing (2 new approvals in 2025)
- Apple/OpenAI platform integration signals mainstream
- Massive TAM if BCIs become consumer devices
- Aging population drives demand for neurological solutions

**Bear:**
- All major players still private
- Technical challenges unsolved (longevity, bandwidth)
- Regulatory and ethical hurdles
- Non-invasive may be "good enough" for many applications
- Reimbursement uncertain
