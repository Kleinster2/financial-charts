**Direct lender** — Non-bank institution providing loans directly to companies, bypassing syndicated loan markets. Core of [[Private credit]].

## Why direct lending grew

Banks retreated from middle-market lending post-[[GFC]] due to [[Basel III]] capital requirements. Direct lenders filled the gap, offering:
- Speed and certainty of execution
- Flexibility on terms
- Ability to hold entire deals
