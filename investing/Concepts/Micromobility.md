# Micromobility

Short-distance urban travel via shared electric scooters and e-bikes, rented by the minute through an app. The sector experienced a textbook VC boom-bust cycle (2017–2023) that destroyed ~$3B in investor capital, bankrupted the pioneer (Bird), and left one survivor ([[Lime]]) as the only operator to achieve sustained profitability.

---

## The boom-bust arc

### Phase 1: Guerrilla launch (2017)

Bird deployed hundreds of scooters in Santa Monica in Sep 2017 — no city permission, no permits. Santa Monica filed criminal complaints. Bird paid $300K+ in fines but proved the concept: massive consumer demand for last-mile transport.

### Phase 2: VC mania (2018–2019)

| Milestone | Date | Detail |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Bird hits $1B valuation | Jun 2018 | Fastest unicorn in history at the time (9 months) |
| Bird hits $2B | Oct 2018 | Just 4 months after $1B |
| Lime $2.4B valuation | Apr 2019 | Peak |
| BCG projects $40-50B TAM | 2019 | Fueled fundraising frenzy |
| Total VC deployed | 2017-2020 | $3B+ across dozens of operators |

**What went wrong:** VCs applied ride-hailing logic (winner-takes-all, blitz-scale) to a business with no network effects. More scooters ≠ better product after a density threshold. Oversupply crashed utilization, destroyed vehicles, and antagonized cities.

### Phase 3: Scooter wars and regulatory backlash (2018–2020)

Cities were caught off-guard by overnight deployments of thousands of scooters:

- **San Francisco** (2018): cease-and-desist letters to Bird, Lime, Spin. Denied permits to all four applicants initially
- **Multiple cities**: 15 mph speed limits, geo-fencing, parking zones, fleet caps
- **Operator response**: Shift from "ask forgiveness" to multi-year permitting relationships

**"Scooter rage" and vandalism:** Residents angry about sidewalk clutter and overnight deployments began throwing scooters into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Portland residents created scootersintheriverpdx.com to document the problem. 50+ scooters dredged from the Willamette River in Oregon. 257+ pulled from Spokane River by magnet fishermen. Scooters found in Lake Merritt (Oakland), the Pacific off Venice Beach, the Trinity River (Dallas), and the Broad Ripple Canal (Indianapolis). [[Lithium]]-ion batteries leach nickel and other hazardous materials into ecosystems. The dockless model — leave anywhere, no accountability — made anonymous disposal trivially easy

### Phase 4: COVID and consolidation (2020–2022)

- Lime: laid off 13%, valuation crashed 79% ($2.4B → $510M), pulled from most international markets
- Bird: laid off 30%
- Dozens of small operators shut down entirely
- Uber dumped Jump bikes to Lime (+ $170M investment) — exit from direct operations

### Phase 5: Reckoning (2022–2023)

| Company | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| **[[Lime]]** | First profitable year (2022), survived |
| **Bird** | Bankrupt Dec 2023 |
| **Spin** | Shut down 2023 |
| **Superpedestrian** | Failed |
| **Skip** | Acquired/shut down |
| **Tier + Dott** | Merged 2022 (survival consolidation) |

### Phase 6: Sole survivor (2024–present)

Lime alone proved the model works. $686M net revenue (2024), $140M+ EBITDA, 200M+ rides, IPO planned 2026. All others are dead, merged, or subscale.

## The investor scorecard

**$7.3B** in VC went into micromobility startups between 2018-2019 alone (PitchBook). Over $5B in total venture funding over ~5 years. Most was destroyed.

### Bird investors (total loss)

| Investor | Round | Approximate exposure | Outcome |
|----------|-------|---------------------|---------|
| **[[Sequoia Capital]]** | Series C lead ($1B val), 2019 ($275M round), 2021 convertible | ~$100M+ | Stake worth $4.6M by late 2022. Total loss |
| **[[Accel]] Partners** | Early rounds | — | Total loss |
| **[[Craft Ventures]]** ([[David Sacks]]) | Early | — | Total loss |
| **CDPQ** (Canadian pension) | Co-led $275M round (2019) | — | Total loss |
| **[[Valor Equity Partners]]** | 2021 convertible | — | Total loss |
| **SPAC public investors** | Nov 2021 merger | $414M raised | Stock → $0. Total loss |

Sequoia's ~$100M Bird loss was described as "a drop in the bucket" relative to their [[Google]]/[[Airbnb]] wins. For CDPQ (pension fund), the story is less forgiving.

### Lime investors (likely winners — if IPO goes well)

| Investor | Entry | Estimated status |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **[[Andreessen Horowitz]]** | Seed ($12M, 2017) | Earliest entry; strong upside at any IPO valuation >$500M |
| **[[Bain Capital]] Ventures** | Series D lead, later rounds | Multiple entry points; likely positive |
| **Uber** | $170M at $510M valuation (2020) | Bought the dip; significant upside at $1.7B+ |
| **[[GV]]** ([[Google]] Ventures) | Multiple rounds | Likely positive |
| **[[Fidelity]]** | Later rounds | Likely positive |
| **[[IVP]]** | Series D | Likely positive |
| **[[Coatue]]** | Series D | Likely positive |
| **[[GIC]]** (Singapore sovereign) | Series D | Likely positive |

**Key dynamic:** Lime's 2020 funding at $510M was effectively a distressed round (down 79% from $2.4B). Uber and others who bought that dip got the best entry. If Lime IPOs at $1.7-2.1B, that's a 3-4x in 6 years for the 2020 investors.

### Lyft / Motivate ($251M acquisition)

[[Lyft]] paid $251M for Motivate (Citi Bike, [[Divvy]], Bay Wheels) in 2018. Explored selling in 2023, then reversed course. Now "Lyft Urban Solutions" — small revenue contributor (~3-5% of Lyft total) but growing 60% YoY. Hard to value as standalone; Crain's estimated Citi Bike operator could be worth up to $500M.

### [[Ather Energy]] investors (modest wins)

| Investor | Entry | Return at IPO |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **IIT Madras incubators** | ₹25 lakh seed (2014) | 200x+ |
| **[[Tiger Global]]** | Series A ($12M, 2015) | ~8.3x |
| **Hero MotoCorp** | Series B-C (2016-2020) | 38% stake; strategic value |

### Lessons

1. **First movers lost.** Bird (Sep 2017) is bankrupt. Lime (Jan 2017) survived by being slower and more disciplined
2. **Buying the dip worked.** Uber's 2020 entry at $510M will likely 3-4x. The 2018-2019 peak investors got crushed
3. **Pension funds shouldn't play VC.** CDPQ co-leading Bird's 2019 round is a cautionary tale
4. **Winner-takes-all was wrong.** The VC thesis assumed ride-hailing dynamics. Scooters have no network effects. Overcapital → oversupply → value destruction

## Why most operators failed

The core problem: **unit economics were underwater at scale.**

| Cost driver | Early reality | What it takes to survive |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Vehicle lifespan** | <6 months (vandalism, weather, cheap hardware) | 2+ years (modular design, better materials) |
| **Daily utilization** | <2 rides/day in many markets | 4+ rides/day |
| **Ops cost per ride** | $2-3 (collection, charging, rebalancing) | <$1 (swappable batteries, contractor networks) |
| **Regulatory cost** | Permits revoked, fines, fleet caps | Long-term city relationships |
| **CAC** | High (app downloads, promotions) | Near-zero (Uber/Maps integration) |

**Bird's specific failure:** Went public via SPAC (2021) at $2.5B. Never achieved positive EBITDA. Spent on marketing and expansion while vehicles lasted <1 year. Filed Ch. 11 in Dec 2023.

## Operating realities

### The injury crisis

Micromobility injuries spiked 450% in the US between 2017 and 2021 (CPSC data). 360,800 ER visits from micromobility devices (2017–2022). Deaths rose from 5 (2018) to 30 (2021). Head injuries account for 40-45% of all e-scooter accidents; <5% of riders wear helmets.

This wasn't just a PR problem — it fueled the political backlash that led to bans. Every ER visit generated local news coverage, every death a city council hearing.

### The "juicer" gig economy

Before swappable batteries, scooter companies outsourced their entire logistics to gig workers:

| Role | Pay | Hours | Process |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Lime "Juicers"** | $5-12/scooter | 9pm–7am | Find dead scooters via app → load into car → charge at home overnight → return to "hubs" by 7am |
| **Bird "Chargers"** | $3-20/scooter (variable bounty) | Nocturnal | Similar; later shifted to "fleet managers" ($1,500/week, managing 50 scooters) |

**Economics:** Electricity cost was negligible (~$0.12-0.45/scooter). The real cost was the worker's time, vehicle, and gas. Juicers are independent contractors — no minimum wage, no benefits. Typical earnings: $50-100/night for committed workers.

**Problems:** Hoarding (juicers hiding scooters to collect higher bounties later), safety (lured to sketchy locations at night), and the fundamental absurdity of paying humans to drive cars around collecting scooters in order to... reduce car trips.

Swappable batteries eliminated this entire model — and with it, 43% of the lifecycle carbon footprint.

### "Deploy first, apologize later"

Bird's founding playbook: drop scooters on city streets with no permits, no city approval, no warning. Let consumer demand create political pressure for legalization. The Uber model applied to hardware.

**Where it worked:** Created instant consumer demand. Proved the concept in weeks. Generated massive press coverage.

**Where it failed:** Unlike Uber (which had powerful rider/driver constituencies), scooters antagonized more people than they pleased. Sidewalk clutter, injuries, river dumping, and noise complaints meant cities had political cover to ban rather than legalize. The guerrilla strategy generated its own antibodies.

**Result:** Every city that matters now requires permits. The "ask forgiveness" window closed by 2019. Regulatory relationships became the moat — exactly what Bird's culture couldn't build.

### Who actually rides: tourism vs. commuting

The "replacing car trips" narrative operators sold to cities doesn't match usage data:

| Use case | Share of rides | Characteristics |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Leisure/recreation** | 50-65% | Weekends, midday, tourists, "just for fun" |
| **Commuting** | 13-20% | Weekdays, regular users, first/last-mile |
| **Tourism** | 25-65% (varies by city) | Longer trips (~30 min vs. 15 min for locals), no peak-hour pattern |
| **Errands** | ~14% | Irregular |

**The problem:** Only commute trips reliably displace car trips. Leisure/tourism rides mostly displace walking or would not have happened at all. This undermines both the environmental case and the "essential transport" political argument cities need to justify permitting.

**Paris specifically:** 42% of riders were non-residents. Easy for local voters to ban something primarily used by tourists.

### City permit economics

Cities extract significant revenue from shared scooter operators — and it creates a regulatory moat:

| Fee type | Range | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Annual operator permit | $0 – $20,000 | Santa Monica: $20K/year |
| Per-vehicle fee | $0 – $420/year | Portland: $420/scooter/year |
| Per-ride fee | $0.15 – $0.25 | Boulder: $0.15/ride |
| Application fee | $50 – $325 | DC: $325 |

**Key finding (Portland State study, 2024):** Taxes and fees on shared micromobility average **$0.70/mile** — vs. $0.13/mile for ride-hail and $0.03/mile for private cars. **23x higher per mile than driving.** Cities are taxing the thing they claim to want more of.

**Why it matters for investors:** Permit fees are a cost floor that small operators can't absorb. Combined with fleet caps and multi-year permitting cycles, this creates a barrier to entry that benefits incumbents ([[Lime]], [[Bird]] under Third Lane). The regulatory regime that nearly killed the industry now protects the survivors.

## The Paris precedent

On Apr 2, 2023, Paris held a referendum on shared scooters. 90% voted to ban them. The ban took effect Sep 1, 2023.

**Context:** 15,000 shared scooters operated by Lime, Dott, and Tier. Paris was one of the world's largest shared mobility markets.

**Why it passed:**
- <10% voter turnout (103K of 1.[[3M]] eligible) — older, anti-scooter demographic overrepresented
- No electronic voting (young riders couldn't/didn't vote)
- Mayor Hidalgo positioned against scooters (safety, short battery life, public space conflicts)
- Injuries and sidewalk riding created visceral opposition

**Aftermath:** Paris invested €250M in cycling infrastructure instead. Tourists shifted to shared bikes.

**Investment implication:** Regulatory risk is existential. Any city can ban shared scooters via referendum or council vote. Lime mitigates by operating in 280+ cities (no single-city dependency) and building long-term city relationships.

## The green paradox

Micromobility was marketed as sustainable urban transport. The reality is more complicated — and in the early era, the environmental claims were largely false.

### Lifecycle emissions breakdown

| Source | Share of CO2 footprint |
|--------|----------------------|
| Manufacturing (especially lithium-ion batteries) | ~50% |
| Collection/redistribution (diesel vans) | ~43% |
| Electricity for charging | ~5% |

Average: 202g CO2-eq/passenger-mile (NC State, 2019). **Worse than buses, bikes, walking, and mopeds.** Only better than private cars — and only if the scooter actually replaces a car trip.

### The displacement problem

Research found that only **34% of e-scooter rides replace car trips**. The other 49% replace walking or cycling — meaning those rides are *adding* emissions to the system, not reducing them. The remaining ~17% are new trips (tourism, recreation) that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

### The lifespan problem

Bird's inaugural fleet in Louisville lasted an average of **28.8 days** before destruction. At that lifespan, the manufacturing emissions are never amortized — each scooter is essentially disposable electronics. The math only works if vehicles last 2+ years:

| Lifespan | Emissions vs. car | Environmental verdict |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 28 days (Bird Louisville 2018) | Far worse | Net polluter |
| 3-6 months (early shared era) | Worse | Net polluter |
| 6,500+ km / ~2 years | -46% vs car trips | Net benefit *if replacing cars* |

### The collection van problem

**The old model (2018–2020):** Every night, diesel vans drove city streets collecting dead scooters → trucked them to a warehouse → plugged in overnight → vans redistributed charged scooters the next morning. Hundreds of van-miles per city per night. This generated 50-100g CO2 per scooter per day — nearly half the total lifecycle emissions.

**The fix — swappable batteries:** A worker on an e-cargo bike carries a bag of charged battery packs. They pop out the depleted battery, snap in a fresh one (seconds per scooter), and move on. The scooter never leaves the street. Only small, lightweight battery packs get transported — many per trip. This eliminates the collection fleet entirely: no van, no warehouse, no nightly scooter-hauling. The scooter also stays available more hours per day (better utilization) and takes less physical damage (no tossing in/out of vans nightly).

### Industry improvements (2022–present)

Operators have addressed the worst issues:

| Improvement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Swappable batteries (no collection needed) | -43% of footprint eliminated |
| Vehicle lifespan 2+ years (vs. 28 days) | Manufacturing amortized |
| Electric collection vehicles | -80% redistribution emissions |
| Lime claims | -84% CO2/pkm over 5 years |
| Voi claims | -77% emission intensity since 2019 |

**Bottom line:** Early micromobility was greenwashing — short-lived scooters collected by diesel vans, mostly replacing walking. Modern operations (2+ year vehicles, swappable batteries, electric logistics) can be genuinely lower-carbon than cars, but only when they actually displace car trips. The environmental case is real now but was fraudulent in 2018-2019.

## Unit economics (solved)

Lime's path to profitability:

| Lever | 2019 (loss era) | 2024 (profitable) |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Vehicle cost | ~$500, lasted 6 months | ~$1,000, lasts 2+ years |
| Cost per ride | >$3 ops | <$1.50 fully loaded |
| Revenue per ride | ~$3-4 | ~$4-5 (dynamic pricing) |
| Utilization | Low (oversupply) | Optimized (AI rebalancing) |
| Charging model | Gig workers collect nightly | Swappable batteries, fewer touches |

**The math works when:** vehicle lasts 2+ years × 4+ rides/day × $4+ revenue/ride × <$1.50 cost/ride = ~$3,500+ lifetime profit per vehicle.

---

## The e-bike shift

The sector started as kick scooters but is increasingly **e-bikes** — and the economics are better.

### Why e-bikes are winning

| Metric | Kick scooter | E-bike |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Avg trip length | 1.3 mi / 14 min | 1.3 mi / 15.5 min |
| Revenue per ride | ~$3-4 | ~$4-6 (longer rides, higher willingness to pay) |
| Rides per vehicle/day | 1.8-5 | 0.5-2.5 (lower, but higher revenue per ride) |
| Vehicle durability | Fragile (small wheels, exposed) | Sturdier frame, less vandalism-prone |
| User demographic | Younger, recreational | Commuters, higher-value trips |
| City acceptance | Controversial (sidewalk conflict) | Welcome (replaces cars, uses bike lanes) |
| Weather resilience | Very seasonal | More all-weather capable |

### Market data

- **157M trips** on US/[[Canada]] shared bikes and scooters in 2023 — all-time record, surpassing 2019 peak
- Dockless e-bike trips nearly **quadrupled** in [[Canada]] and grew ~50% in the US (2023)
- Lyft reported **47% global surge** in e-bike trips across 57 cities (2025)
- Lime now derives ~60% of revenue from international markets, particularly cities with bike-friendly infrastructure
- Global bike-sharing market: $9.3B (2024) → $16.4B (2030), 10.2% CAGR

### Key operators

| Operator | E-bike model | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **[[Lime]]** | Mixed fleet (scooters + e-bikes) | Investing heavily in e-bike expansion |
| **Citi Bike** ([[Lyft]]) | Docked + dockless e-bikes | NYC's system; 41M Lyft rides in US cities (2024); Lyft exploring divestment |
| **Capital Bikeshare** | Docked | Washington DC; Lyft-operated |
| **[[Divvy]]** | Docked + e-bikes | Chicago; Lyft-operated |
| **Bay Wheels** | Docked + e-bikes | San Francisco; Lyft-operated |
| **Vélib'** | Docked | Paris; 20K+ bikes, city-owned |

### Docked vs. dockless

Docked systems (Citi Bike, Vélib') avoid the vandalism and collection problems entirely — bikes return to fixed stations. But they're less flexible and require city infrastructure investment. The trend is toward hybrid models: docked stations in dense areas + dockless e-bikes for last-mile coverage.

---

## TAM and penetration

Global shared micromobility is a small fraction of the broader [[Electric Scooters]] market ($49B). Shared segment estimated at ~$5-7B in gross bookings (2024). Upside comes from:

1. **First/last-mile transit integration** — cities increasingly view scooters/bikes as public transit complement
2. **E-bike growth** — higher revenue per ride than kick scooters, 47% trip growth in 2025 (Lyft data)
3. **[[Emerging markets]]** — Latin America, [[Southeast Asia]] still underpenetrated
4. **Subscription models** — monthly passes improve predictability
