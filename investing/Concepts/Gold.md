**Gold** — Precious metal and monetary asset. Safe haven, inflation hedge, central bank reserve. At record highs (Jan 2026) driven by Fed independence concerns and central bank accumulation.

## Current status (Jan 28, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price | **$5,300+/oz** (record high Jan 28) |
| YTD return | **+22%** |
| 2025 return | +65% (best since 1979) |
| 2024 return | +27% |
| Silver | $93.75/oz ATH (Jan 15), now ~$88 |

**Jan 2026 catalysts:**
1. DOJ investigation of [[Jerome Powell]] (Jan 14) — Fed independence crisis
2. NY Fed "rate check" (Jan 24) — market interpreted as coordinated dollar weakening
3. Trump endorsed dollar decline (Jan 28) — "I think it's great"

Gold surged +3% on Jan 28 alone as [[US dollar]] hit 4-year lows (DXY 96.16).

## Price drivers

| Driver | Current status | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Real rates** | Falling (Fed cutting) | Bullish |
| **USD strength** | Weakening on Fed concerns | Bullish |
| **Fed independence** | Crisis mode (Jan 2026) | Very bullish |
| **Central bank buying** | 1,000+ tonnes/year (3 years) | Structural bullish |
| **Geopolitical risk** | [[Iran]] sanctions, tariffs | Bullish |
| **Inflation** | Cooling but sticky | Neutral |

## Central bank accumulation

**Historic shift:** For first time since 1996, gold now accounts for larger share of central bank reserves than US [[Treasuries]].

| Year | CB net purchases | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| 2022 | 1,082 tonnes | Post-sanctions surge |
| 2023 | 1,037 tonnes | Continued accumulation |
| 2024 | 1,000+ tonnes | Third consecutive year |
| 2025 | ~1,000 tonnes | Estimate |
| 2026E | ~755 tonnes | Forecast |

**Key buyers:**
- Poland — largest European buyer, approved additional 150 tonnes (Jan 2026)
- Turkey — diversifying from USD
- Uzbekistan — regional leader
- [[China]] — strategic reserves (under-reported), long-term Treasury holdings at record low (Oct 2025)
- [[India]] — gold reserves ~$25B (2019) → **~$100B** (2025), [[Treasuries]] cut 26% from 2023 peak to $174B (five-year low)
- [[Brazil]] — long-term Treasury holdings at record low (Oct 2025)

**Why they're buying:**
- De-dollarization post-[[Russia]] sanctions (2022 freeze was catalyst)
- Geopolitical hedging (tariffs, sanctions weaponization)
- Reserve diversification
- No counterparty risk

**OMFIF survey (Nov 2025):** ~60% of central banks plan to seek alternatives to dollar in next 1-2 years.

## Fed independence correlation

| Scenario | Gold response |
|----------|---------------|
| Fed independence threatened | Rally (safe haven) |
| Political pressure on rates | Rally (credibility concerns) |
| Dovish Fed chair appointed | Rally (inflation fears) |
| Fed credibility restored | Consolidation |

**Julius Baer (Jan 2026):**
> "We see increased interference with the Fed as a key bullish wildcard for the precious metals in 2026."

**El-Erian (Jan 2026):**
> "Price of gold indicates at the margin, people are reducing their exposure to the U.S. dollar."

## 2026 forecasts (stale)

**Note:** These targets set pre-Jan selloff are now obsolete — gold already at $5,300+.

| Source | [[Target]] | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| J.P. Morgan | $4,800 | **Exceeded** |
| [[State Street]] | $5,000 | **Exceeded** |
| [[Bank of America]] | $5,000 | **Exceeded** |
| Bull case | $6,000 | In play |

Forecasts will likely be revised up given rate check/dollar weakness.

---

## Bull case

**Central bank buying:**
- Non-aligned central banks diversifying from dollar assets
- [[China]], [[Russia]], emerging markets accumulating
- Structural shift in reserve composition
- Post-sanctions world ([[Russia]] 2022) accelerated trend

**De-dollarization thesis:**
- Weaponization of dollar reserves raises hedging demand
- [[BRICS]] seeking alternatives
- Gold = neutral reserve asset

**Macro hedges:**
- [[BlackRock]]: "Long-dated [[Treasuries]] no longer provide ballast; prefer gold"
- JPM Wealth: Gold hedges geopolitical/currency volatility

---

## Bear case / Risks

**Opportunity cost:**
- Real yields matter — high real rates historically negative for gold
- Fed staying higher-for-longer delays rally

**Not portfolio hedge:**
- [[BlackRock]]: "Tactical play; not long-term portfolio hedge"
- Volatility can be high

**Patience testing:**
- Evercore ISI: "Wide-ranging frustration; testing patience"
- Contrarian indicator if sentiment too bullish

## Historical context

| Period | Price | Driver |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 1970s | $35 → $850 | Nixon shock, inflation |
| 1980-2000 | $850 → $250 | Volcker, disinflation |
| 2001-2011 | $250 → $1,900 | GFC, QE, [[Euro]] crisis |
| 2012-2019 | $1,200-1,500 | Consolidation |
| 2020-2024 | $1,500 → $2,700 | COVID, inflation, CB buying |
| 2025-2026 | $2,700 → $5,300+ | Fed independence, de-dollarization, rate check |

## Mining stock outperformance (Jan 2026)

**Miners beating metal:**

| Asset | 2025 Return | 2026 YTD |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Spot gold | ~65% | +6.9% |
| [[Newmont]] | **+100%+** (doubled) | — |
| [[Agnico Eagle]] | **+100%+** (doubled) | — |
| NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index | — | **+12%** |
| S&P 500 | — | +0.7% |

**Why miners outperform:** Costs lag metal price increases → operating leverage. Both Newmont and Agnico expected to see EPS climb 85%+ YoY.

**Risk:** Previous boom cycles marred by rising costs and bad acquisitions. If miners buy other miners at expensive valuations at top of cycle, could weigh on shares.
