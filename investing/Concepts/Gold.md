## 2026 outlook

**2025 drivers:**

- Fed rate cut expectations
- Geopolitical tensions (Venezuela, Russia-Ukraine)
- Central bank buying (de-dollarization)
- ETF inflows resuming

---

## Bull case

**Central bank buying:**
- Non-aligned central banks diversifying from dollar assets
- China, Russia, emerging markets accumulating
- Structural shift in reserve composition
- Post-sanctions world (Russia 2022) accelerated trend

**De-dollarization thesis:**
- Weaponization of dollar reserves raises hedging demand
- BRICS seeking alternatives
- Gold = neutral reserve asset

**Macro hedges:**
- BlackRock: "Long-dated Treasuries no longer provide ballast; prefer gold"
- JPM Wealth: Gold hedges geopolitical/currency volatility
- UBS: Quality bonds AND gold for stability

**Retail demand:**
- SocGen: "Retail investors have continued to diversify their assets and pile into gold"
- "Buy the dips" recommendation

---

## Bear case / Risks

**Opportunity cost:**
- Real yields matter — high real rates historically negative for gold
- Fed staying higher-for-longer delays rally

**Patience testing:**
- Evercore ISI: "Wide-ranging frustration; testing patience"
- Contrarian indicator if sentiment too bullish

**Not portfolio hedge:**
- BlackRock: "Tactical play; not long-term portfolio hedge"
- Volatility can be high
