# AI Agents

Autonomous AI systems that can execute multi-step tasks, use tools, and interact with external systems. Emerging paradigm beyond chatbots.

---

## Definition

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Core idea | AI that takes actions, not just generates text |
| Key capability | Tool use, planning, execution loops |
| Distinction | Chatbot answers questions; agent completes tasks |

---

## Architecture patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| ReAct | Reasoning + Acting loop | Chain-of-thought with tool calls |
| Function calling | LLM invokes structured APIs | OpenAI function calling |
| Multi-agent | Multiple specialized agents collaborate | AutoGen, CrewAI |
| Orchestrator | Central planner delegates to sub-agents | Devin (Cognition) |

## Key players

| Company | Agent product | Focus |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| [[Anthropic]] | [[Claude]] computer use | General-purpose |
| [[OpenAI]] | GPT-4 + tools, Operator | General-purpose |
| [[Cognition]] | Devin | Software engineering |
| [[Adept]] | ACT-1 | Enterprise workflows |
| [[Google]] | [[Gemini]] + extensions | [[Consumer]]/enterprise |
| [[Microsoft]] | Copilot agents | M365 integration |
| [[Salesforce]] | Agentforce | CRM automation |
| [[ServiceNow]] | AI agents | IT workflows |

## Vertical applications

| Sector | Use case | Players |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **[[Cybersecurity]]** | SOC automation, triage | [[Torq]], Tines |
| **Software dev** | Coding, debugging | [[Cognition]], [[Cursor]], Replit |
| **Sales** | Outbound, qualification | 11x, Artisan |
| **Customer support** | Ticket resolution | Intercom, Zendesk AI |
| **Data analysis** | Query, report generation | [[Databricks]], [[Glean]] |
| **Legal** | Document review, research | [[Harvey]], Casetext |

---

## Investment implications

| Thesis | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Infrastructure picks | LLM providers, cloud (compute demand) |
| Vertical [[SaaS]] disruption | Agents replace workflows, not just assist |
| Labor automation | Knowledge work more exposed than expected |
| Security concerns | Agents with credentials = new attack surface |

---

## Risks and limitations

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Reliability | Agents fail on edge cases, need human oversight |
| Hallucination | Actions based on wrong reasoning |
| Security | Credential access, prompt injection |
| Cost | Long agentic loops expensive (token usage) |
