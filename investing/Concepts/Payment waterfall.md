# Payment Waterfall

**Who gets paid first** — the contractual order in which creditors receive proceeds from asset sales, cash flows, or liquidation. Higher in the waterfall = paid first. Lower = paid only if something remains.

---

## How it works

```
Proceeds from assets/operations
    ↓
Administrative claims (lawyers, advisors)
    ↓
DIP financing (if bankruptcy)
    ↓
First Lien / First Out (1O)
    ↓
Second Lien / Second Out (2O)
    ↓
Third Out (3O)
    ↓
Unsecured creditors
    ↓
Preferred equity
    ↓
Common equity
```

**Key principle:** Each level must be satisfied in full before the next level receives anything (the "absolute priority rule").

---

## Within the same lien: First Out / Second Out / Third Out

Creditors with the **same lien** on collateral can still have different payment priority:

| Position | Abbreviation | When paid |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **First Out** | 1O | First from proceeds |
| **Second Out** | 2O | After 1O fully satisfied |
| **Third Out** | 3O | After 2O fully satisfied |

**Why this exists:** In [[Distressed debt exchange]]s, new money lenders demand senior "first out" position. Existing holders get pushed to 2O/3O in exchange for avoiding immediate bankruptcy.

## Case study: [[Saks Global]]

The [[Saks bankruptcy]] illustrates a multi-tier waterfall:

| Position | Instrument | Amount | Recovery |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| **1O** | SPV Notes (SGUS) | $762M | ~25 cents |
| **2O** | Second Out Notes | $1.4B | <5 cents |
| **3O** | Third Out Notes | $441M | <5 cents |
| **Unsecured** | Old notes, vendors | — | Pennies |
| **Equity** | [[Amazon]], [[Salesforce]] | $475M+ | Zero |

New money (summer 2025) got the senior SPV position. Original bondholders who exchanged got 2O/3O. Those who didn't exchange got wiped.

## Waterfall mechanics

### Triggers

| Event | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Asset sale** | Proceeds flow through waterfall |
| **Bankruptcy liquidation** | All assets sold, distributed by priority |
| **Cash sweep** | Excess cash applied to debt by priority |
| **Refinancing** | Payoffs follow waterfall |

### Negotiations

Waterfall position is heavily negotiated:

| Party | Wants |
|-------|-------|
| New money lenders | First out, best collateral |
| Existing secured | Maintain position, avoid dilution |
| Unsecured | Any recovery, seat at table |
| Equity | Survival (usually gets nothing) |

## Investment implications

**For credit investors:**
- Waterfall position determines recovery in distress
- "First out" isn't foolproof — Saks 1O still lost 75%
- New money typically extracts best terms

**For equity investors:**
- Equity is last — often worthless in restructuring
- Even preferred equity (Amazon) sits below all debt
- Consent rights don't change waterfall position
