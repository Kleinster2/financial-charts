**EU-China EV tariffs** — The EU's response to Chinese EV imports. Originally punitive tariffs (7.8-35.3%), now transitioning to minimum price floor mechanism. Deal announced Jan 2026.

---

## Background

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| **Oct 2024** | EU imposes countervailing tariffs on Chinese EV imports |
| **Dec 2025** | EU initiates individual review for [[Volkswagen]] (Cupra Tavascan) |
| **Jan 12, 2026** | EU-China agree on minimum price mechanism framework |

---

## Original tariff structure (Oct 2024)

| Component | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Base import duty | 10% |
| Additional countervailing duty | 7.8% - 35.3% |
| **Combined max** | **45.3%** |
| Duration | 5 years |

**Tariff rates by company:**

| Company | Additional duty | Combined |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| [[BYD]] | 17.0% | 27.0% |
| Geely | 18.8% | 28.8% |
| SAIC | 35.3% | 45.3% |
| [[Volkswagen]] (China-built) | 20.7% | 30.7% |

## Minimum price mechanism (Jan 2026)

**The deal:** Replace tariffs with minimum import prices per model. Chinese OEMs commit to price floors; EU drops punitive duties.

### Two pricing methods

| Method | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **CIF-based** | Exporter's cost + countervailing duty margin |
| **EU comparables** | Match price of comparable EU-built EVs (incl. SG&A + profit) |

### Key requirements

- Specific minimum prices required **per model and configuration**
- EU encourages additional commitments:
  - Annual shipment volumes
  - Planned EU investments
- Applications submitted to EU Commission

## Volkswagen individual review

**Special case:** VW broke from other European OEMs to negotiate individually.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Model affected | **Cupra Tavascan** |
| Factory | VW Anhui (Hefei, China) |
| Original tariff | 30.7% combined |
| VW commitment | Limit models exported, set minimum prices |
| Expected outcome | 20.7% additional duty dropped |

**Strategic significance:** VW prioritized protecting its China-built EV exports over solidarity with European OEM lobby.

## Winners and losers

### Winners

| Actor | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Chinese OEMs** (BYD, Geely, etc.) | Keep price difference as profit instead of paying to EU |
| **Chinese exporters** | Stable, predictable market access |
| **EU consumers** (partial) | Prices likely flat, not rising further |

### Losers

| Actor | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **European OEMs** | Still face cost/tech disadvantage |
| **EU budget** | Loses tariff revenue |
| **Consumers hoping for price cuts** | Chinese OEMs already absorbed tariffs |

**Key insight:** Most Chinese manufacturers had already absorbed the tariffs into margins. This deal likely boosts their profits rather than lowering consumer prices.

---

## Market context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China-built cars share of EU sales (H1 2025) | **6%** (up from 5% H1 2024) |
| Projected Chinese OEM EU share by 2030 | **~10%** (AlixPartners) |
| Key Chinese exporters | BYD, SAIC (MG), Geely (Polestar), NIO |
| European OEMs building in China | VW, BMW, Mercedes |

**Note:** European brands building EVs in China (VW, BMW) face same rules — origin matters, not brand.

---

## Contrast with US approach

| Policy | EU | US |
|--------|----|----|
| Initial tariff | 7.8-35.3% | **100%** (Section 301) |
| Base duty | 10% | 2.5% |
| Mechanism shift | Minimum prices | No change |
| Market access | Yes (with conditions) | **Effectively blocked** |

**Implication:** EU chose managed trade; US chose protectionism. Chinese OEMs can grow in Europe, not US.

---

## Investment implications

**For Chinese EV makers:**
- Europe remains accessible (unlike US)
- Margins may improve (keep tariff equivalent)
- Volume growth path preserved

**For European OEMs:**
- No relief from Chinese competition
- Cost/tech gap persists
- VW's individual deal may disadvantage others

**For [[BYD]] specifically:**
- Bear case "European tariff risk" reduced
- Growth path in EU preserved
- Must maintain minimum prices per model
