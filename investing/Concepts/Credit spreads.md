# Credit spreads

The yield premium investors demand to hold corporate bonds over risk-free [[Treasuries]]. Widening spreads signal rising risk aversion; tightening signals confidence.

## Key metrics

### Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)

The standard measure. Accounts for embedded options in bonds. Expressed in basis points over [[Treasuries]].

**Primary indices (ICE BofA):**
- **HY OAS** (BAMLH0A0HYM2) — high-yield / junk bonds
- **IG OAS** — investment-grade corporates
- **CCC OAS** (BAMLH0A3HYC) — lowest-rated junk

### Typical ranges

| Spread    | Normal     | Elevated   | Crisis     |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| HY OAS    | 3-4%       | 5-6%       | > 8%       |
| IG OAS    | 0.8-1.2%   | 1.5-2%     | > 3%       |
| HY - IG   | 2-3%       | 3-4%       | > 5%       |

## How to read it

**Tightening (risk-on):** Investors confident in corporate health, willing to accept less premium for credit risk. Often coincides with equity rallies.

**Widening (risk-off):** Investors demand more compensation for default risk. Can precede or accompany equity selloffs.

**HY-IG differential:** Rising spread between junk and investment-grade shows stress concentrated in weaker credits—often an early warning.

## 2025 context

Credit spreads reached historic tights in late 2024:
- **HY OAS:** ~2.56% (Feb 2025)—only seen in May 2007 (pre-GFC), July 2021
- **IG OAS:** ~0.80% (Jan 2025)

This extreme tightness signaled:
1. Strong corporate fundamentals / earnings
2. Abundant liquidity chasing yield
3. Potential complacency / asymmetric risk

Spreads widened modestly through 2025 but remained historically tight, suggesting confidence despite tariff chaos.

## Why spreads matter

### Leading indicator

Credit markets often lead equities. Spread widening can precede stock selloffs as bond investors—typically more conservative—react first to deteriorating conditions.

### Capital flow driver

Kansas City Fed research found credit spreads drive the majority of EM capital flow effects—more than [[VIX]]. When spreads widen, capital flees risk assets globally.

### HY-IG spread vs S&P 500

Strong inverse correlation: when HY-IG spread rises, S&P 500 falls. Tightening spreads with rising equities = confirmed risk-on.

## Historical extremes

| Event                 | HY OAS    | Date       |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 2008 financial crisis | > 20%     | Dec 2008   |
| COVID crash           | ~11%      | Mar 2020   |
| 2011 Europe/debt      | ~8%       | Oct 2011   |
| 2016 energy crisis    | ~8%       | Feb 2016   |
| Late 2024 tights      | ~2.5%     | Nov 2024   |

## Interpreting current tights

At ~2.5-3% HY OAS, historical distribution suggests:
- Limited room for further tightening
- Higher probability of widening than compression
- Asymmetric return profile: modest upside, meaningful downside

This doesn't mean imminent crisis—spreads can stay tight for years—but risk/reward favors caution in credit.
