# Real Business Cycle theory

#concept #macro #economics #nobel

**Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory** — Macroeconomic framework arguing that business cycles are driven primarily by real (supply-side) shocks — especially technology and productivity changes — rather than monetary or demand-side factors. Developed by [[Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward Prescott]] (1982), part of their 2004 Nobel Prize.

## Core idea

Before RBC, the dominant view was that recessions were caused by insufficient demand (Keynesian) or monetary policy mistakes (Monetarist). Kydland and Prescott showed that **rational responses to productivity shocks** could generate realistic business cycle patterns without any market failures or policy errors.

| Traditional view | RBC view |
|-----------------|----------|
| Cycles = market failures | Cycles = optimal responses to shocks |
| Demand-driven | Supply-driven |
| Policy can smooth cycles | Policy may worsen cycles |
| Sticky prices/wages | Flexible prices/wages |
| Involuntary unemployment | Intertemporal labor substitution |

## How it works

1. **Productivity shock** — Technology improves (or worsens)
2. **Rational response** — Firms and workers adjust optimally
3. **Propagation** — "Time to build" spreads shock over time
4. **Business cycle** — Aggregate fluctuations emerge from micro decisions

| Shock type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Positive technology shock** | Higher productivity → higher wages → more work → expansion |
| **Negative technology shock** | Lower productivity → lower wages → less work → contraction |

**Key mechanism:** Workers choose when to work. They work more when wages are temporarily high (good productivity) and less when wages are temporarily low (bad productivity). This "intertemporal substitution of labor" amplifies shocks into cycles.

## The 1982 paper

**"Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations"**
Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott, *Econometrica*, 1982

**Innovation:** Built a calibrated quantitative model — not just theory, but numbers that matched US data.

| Feature | Why it mattered |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Calibration** | Used measured parameters, not arbitrary assumptions |
| **Matching moments** | Model output matched real GDP, consumption, investment volatility |
| **Microfoundations** | Aggregate behavior derived from individual optimization |
| **Dynamic** | Captured persistence and propagation of shocks |

## DSGE legacy

RBC pioneered **Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)** models — now the standard framework at central banks and academic macro.

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Dynamic** | Forward-looking, multi-period optimization |
| **Stochastic** | Random shocks drive uncertainty |
| **General Equilibrium** | All markets clear, all agents optimize |

**Who uses DSGE today:**
- [[Federal Reserve]] — policy analysis and forecasting
- ECB, BOE, BOJ — monetary policy
- IMF, World Bank — country analysis
- Academic macro — core research tool

## Criticisms and evolution

| Criticism | Response/Evolution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **No role for monetary policy?** | New Keynesian models add sticky prices, money matters |
| **Technology shocks too volatile?** | Later work added demand shocks, financial frictions |
| **Recessions as optimal?** | Politically uncomfortable but logically coherent |
| **Failed in 2008?** | Spurred "macro-finance" integration |

**Modern synthesis:** "New Keynesian DSGE" models combine RBC's methodology with Keynesian frictions (sticky prices, imperfect competition). These are now standard at central banks.

## Investment implications

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Supply-side recessions** | Not all downturns are demand shortfalls — oil shocks, pandemics, AI displacement |
| **Policy limits** | Stimulus can't fix productivity problems |
| **AI productivity** | If AI is a positive technology shock → RBC predicts expansion |
| **Secular stagnation** | Slow productivity growth = structural headwind |
| **Sector rotation** | Productivity shocks hit sectors unevenly |

**Current relevance:** The AI productivity debate is fundamentally an RBC question — are we seeing a technology shock that will drive real GDP growth?

## Technology shocks through history

| Period | Shock | RBC interpretation |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 1870-1900 | Electrification | Positive productivity → long expansion |
| 1973-74 | Oil embargo | Negative supply shock → stagflation |
| 1995-2000 | Internet/IT | Positive productivity → 90s boom |
| 2020 | COVID | Negative supply (lockdowns) + demand shock |
| 2023-? | AI/LLMs | Potential positive productivity shock (TBD) |

---

## Key equations (simplified)

**Production function:**
Y = A × K^α × L^(1-α)

Where:
- Y = output
- A = total factor productivity (TFP) — the shock
- K = capital
- L = labor
- α ≈ 0.3 (capital share)

**The insight:** Changes in A (productivity) propagate through the economy as firms and workers optimize.
