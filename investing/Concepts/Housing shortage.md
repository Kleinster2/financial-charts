**Housing shortage** — Structural deficit from post-2008 underbuilding. Estimates range 2.5–7.2 million units. Would take 7.5 years of steady building to close gap. Root cause of [[Housing affordability crisis]].

---

## How big is the shortage?

| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| [[Zillow]] | **4.7 million** (all-time high) |
| [[Freddie Mac]] | 3.7 million |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | 3–4 million |
| Realtor.com (SFH only) | 7.2 million |
| Realtor.com (incl. MF) | 2.5 million |
| NMHC (apartments by 2035) | 4.3 million needed |

**Consensus range:** 2.5–5.5 million units short.

---

## What caused it?

**The post-2008 collapse:**

| Year | Annual housing starts |
|------|----------------------|
| 2005 (peak) | 2.26 million |
| 2009 (trough) | **0.5 million** |
| 2010s average | Below historical norms |
| 2024 | ~1.4 million |

**A full decade of underbuilding** — from 2009 through most of 2010s, construction stayed well below historical averages while population grew.

---

## Why it persists

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Labor shortage | Construction workforce didn't recover |
| Land costs | Buildable land prices up |
| Zoning/NIMBYism | Restricts new development |
| Material costs | Lumber, concrete inflation |
| Interest rates | Higher financing costs |
| Permitting delays | Regulatory friction |

**Despite adding 5.8 million units over ~4 years, demand increased by almost the same amount** — very little progress closing the gap.

---

## How long to fix?

**Realtor.com estimate:** ~7.5 years of steady building just to close the gap.

**Challenge:** Current construction (~1.4M/year) barely keeps pace with new household formation, let alone closes the backlog.

---

## Regional variation

**Shortage is not uniform:**

| Market type | Situation |
|-------------|-----------|
| Coastal metros | Severe shortage, zoning constraints |
| Sunbelt growth markets | High demand, construction catching up |
| Midwest/rural | Less acute, population stable/declining |

---

## Who benefits from shortage

| Beneficiary | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Existing homeowners** | Asset appreciation |
| **Landlords** | Rent pricing power |
| **[[Single-family rental]]** | Structural demand |
| **[[Build-to-rent]]** | Growth runway |
| **Homebuilders** | Volume + pricing |

---

## Who's hurt

| Affected group | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| First-time buyers | Priced out |
| Renters | Rent inflation |
| Young households | Delayed family formation |
| Employers | Workforce mobility constrained |
| Economy | Reduced labor market flexibility |

---

## Policy responses

| Approach | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Zoning reform | TX, FL state-level reforms |
| Permitting streamlining | Austin, Houston local reforms |
| Density bonuses | CA ADU laws |
| Affordable housing mandates | Inclusionary zoning |
| Public construction | Limited federal role |

**Challenge:** Housing is local — federal policy has limited direct impact on supply.

## Investment implications

**Structural tailwind for:**
- Homebuilders ([[DR Horton]], [[Lennar]], [[PulteGroup]], [[Toll Brothers]])
- SFR [[REITs]] ([[Invitation Homes]], [[American Homes 4 Rent]])
- Building materials (lumber, cement, fixtures)
- Construction labor/equipment

**The shortage is structural, not cyclical** — even rate cuts won't fix a 4+ million unit deficit quickly.
