**Rare earth leverage** — China's dominance in rare earth elements and critical minerals gives it asymmetric power in technology conflicts. A key tool in [[China retaliatory toolkit]].

---

## China's dominance

| Stage | China share | Rest of world |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Mining | ~60% | Australia, Myanmar, US |
| Processing | ~90% | Minimal alternatives |
| Magnet production | ~90% | Japan (small) |

The processing bottleneck is the real chokepoint. Even ore mined elsewhere often goes to China for refining.

## Key elements

| Element | Use case | China control |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Neodymium | EV motors, wind turbines | ~90% |
| Dysprosium | High-temp magnets | ~99% |
| Terbium | Solid-state devices | ~90% |
| Gallium | Semiconductors, 5G | ~98% |
| Germanium | Fiber optics, IR | ~60% |

## Historical precedent

### Japan dispute (2010)

China cut rare earth exports to Japan during Senkaku Islands dispute:
- Prices spiked 10x
- Japan scrambled for alternatives
- Triggered long-term diversification efforts

### Gallium/germanium controls (2023)

In response to [[Export controls]] on semiconductors:
- Export licenses required for gallium, germanium
- Targeted chip-related materials
- Signal of escalation capability

### 2024-2025 escalation

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Dec 2024 | Banned germanium, gallium, antimony sales to US |
| Apr 4, 2025 | Restricted 7 REEs (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) — response to Trump tariffs |
| Oct 9, 2025 | Added 5 more REEs (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) + [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] retaliation |
| Oct 2025 | First Chinese use of FDPR (foreign direct product rule) — extraterritorial controls |
| Nov 7, 2025 | Suspended controls for 1 year (pause, not reversal) |
| Dec 1, 2025 | Military-affiliated companies denied all export licenses |
| Dec 2025 | Announced silver export controls starting 2026 |

**Key escalation**: October 2025 marked China's first use of FDPR — the same extraterritorial mechanism the US uses for semiconductors. Products made outside China now require licenses if they contain Chinese-origin materials.

**Impact**: European rare earth prices reached 6x Chinese domestic prices. US automakers cut production. No US heavy rare earth separation capacity exists.

## Why it matters

### Asymmetric power
- West needs rare earths for clean energy transition
- EVs, wind turbines, defense systems all depend on them
- No short-term substitutes

### Time advantage
- Western mines take 10-15 years to develop
- Processing capacity takes even longer
- China can impose costs faster than West can adapt

### Escalation risk
- Full embargo would be economic warfare
- But partial restrictions create uncertainty
- Market anticipates and front-runs

---

## Western response

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| US rare earth mining (MP Materials) | Small scale |
| Australia processing | Early stage |
| EU Critical Raw Materials Act | Policy phase |
| Recycling programs | Nascent |
| Magnet redesign (less rare earth) | R&D |

Timeline to reduce dependence: 10+ years minimum.

## Investment implications

**Beneficiaries of diversification:**
- Non-China rare earth miners
- Processing technology companies
- Recycling and urban mining
- Magnet alternatives research

**At-risk sectors:**
- EV manufacturers (supply chain vulnerability)
- Wind turbine producers
- Defense contractors
- **Semiconductor equipment** ([[ASML]] High-NA EUV needs Dy/Tb magnets)
- Any company with rare earth-intensive products

---

## Semiconductor equipment vector

A less obvious but critical dependency:

| Equipment | REE role |
|-----------|----------|
| [[ASML]] High-NA EUV | Dy/Tb magnets for wafer/reticle stage positioning |
| Precision actuators | Nanometer-scale motion control |

**The chain**: China REE controls → ASML production bottleneck → [[1.4nm race]] delays → AI chip supply constrained

**Mitigation (Dec 2025)**: REAlloys $21M SRC deal to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027 — specifically for semiconductor equipment magnets.
