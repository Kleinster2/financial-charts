**Rare earth leverage** — China's dominance in rare earth elements and critical minerals gives it asymmetric power in technology conflicts. A key tool in [[China retaliatory toolkit]].

---

## China's dominance

| Stage | China share | Rest of world |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Mining | ~60% | Australia, Myanmar, US |
| Processing | ~90% | Minimal alternatives |
| Magnet production | ~90% | Japan (small) |

The processing bottleneck is the real chokepoint. Even ore mined elsewhere often goes to China for refining.

## Key elements

| Element | Use case | China control |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Neodymium | EV motors, wind turbines | ~90% |
| Dysprosium | High-temp magnets | ~99% |
| Terbium | Solid-state devices | ~90% |
| Gallium | Semiconductors, 5G | ~98% |
| Germanium | Fiber optics, IR | ~60% |

## Historical precedent

### Japan dispute (2010)

China cut rare earth exports to Japan during Senkaku Islands dispute:
- Prices spiked 10x
- Japan scrambled for alternatives
- Triggered long-term diversification efforts

### Gallium/germanium controls (2023)

In response to [[Export controls]] on semiconductors:
- Export licenses required for gallium, germanium
- Targeted chip-related materials
- Signal of escalation capability

### Nexperia retaliation (2025)

After [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]]:
- Tightened rare earth export controls (Oct 9)
- Part of broader retaliatory package

## Why it matters

### Asymmetric power
- West needs rare earths for clean energy transition
- EVs, wind turbines, defense systems all depend on them
- No short-term substitutes

### Time advantage
- Western mines take 10-15 years to develop
- Processing capacity takes even longer
- China can impose costs faster than West can adapt

### Escalation risk
- Full embargo would be economic warfare
- But partial restrictions create uncertainty
- Market anticipates and front-runs

---

## Western response

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| US rare earth mining (MP Materials) | Small scale |
| Australia processing | Early stage |
| EU Critical Raw Materials Act | Policy phase |
| Recycling programs | Nascent |
| Magnet redesign (less rare earth) | R&D |

Timeline to reduce dependence: 10+ years minimum.

## Investment implications

**Beneficiaries of diversification:**
- Non-China rare earth miners
- Processing technology companies
- Recycling and urban mining
- Magnet alternatives research

**At-risk sectors:**
- EV manufacturers (supply chain vulnerability)
- Wind turbine producers
- Defense contractors
- Any company with rare earth-intensive products
