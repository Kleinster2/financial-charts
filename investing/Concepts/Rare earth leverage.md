#concept #geopolitics #china #commodities

**Rare earth leverage** — [[China]]'s dominance in rare earth elements and critical minerals gives it asymmetric power in technology conflicts. A key tool in [[China retaliatory toolkit]].

---

## [[China]]'s dominance

| Stage | [[China]] share | Rest of world |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Mining | ~70% | [[Australia]], Myanmar, US |
| Processing | ~90% | Minimal alternatives |
| Magnet production | ~90% | [[Japan]] (small) |

**Production (2024):**

| Country | Output | Reserves |
|---------|--------|----------|
| [[China]] | 270,000 tons | 44M tons (\#1) |
| US | 45,000 tons | 1.9M tons (\#7) |
| [[Australia]] | — | \#4 globally |

[[China]] doubled output over 5 years. US has just 4% of [[China]]'s reserves.

**Deng Xiaoping (1992):** "The Middle East has oil, [[China]] has rare earths."

The processing bottleneck is the real chokepoint. Even ore mined elsewhere often goes to [[China]] for refining.

---

## Myanmar: The hidden chokepoint

**Myanmar = 3rd largest rare earth source, critical for heavy REEs:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global rank | **\#3** (after [[China]], US) |
| Dy/Tb share | **~50% of global mining** |
| [[China]] import share | **50% by value** |
| Processing | **100% goes to [[China]]** |

**[[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA):**
- Rebel group captured Pangwa (major mining area) **Oct 2024**
- Now controls **nearly all** Myanmar rare earth mines
- No capacity to process — must ship to [[China]]
- [[China]] closed border after capture → imports dropped **90%**
- Rebounded **April 2025** (~5,000 tons) — suggests [[China]]-KIA deal

**Supply chain exposure (Global Witness):**
- [[Ford]], [[Hyundai]], [[Siemens]], [[Tesla]], Vestas, VW all linked to Myanmar rare earth supply chains
- Only [[Siemens]] responded with due diligence claims

**Ryan Castilloux (Adamas Intelligence):** "Five years from now, we will look back on this and say, 'Oh, I can't believe that happened.'"

**Nabeel Mancheri (ex-Global Rare Earth Industry Association):** Chinese magnet manufacturers "always say, 'No, we are not using any heavy rare earths coming from Myanmar.' That is a lie and cannot be possible. You don't have any other option."

**Implication:** Even if US builds domestic light REE capacity (MP Materials), heavy REEs (Dy, Tb) flow through Myanmar → [[China]]. No alternative path exists.

## Key elements

| Element | Use case | [[China]] control |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Neodymium | EV motors, wind turbines | ~90% |
| [[Dysprosium]] | High-temp magnets | ~99% |
| [[Terbium]] | Solid-state devices | ~90% |
| [[Gallium]] | [[Semiconductors]], [[5G]] | ~98% |
| [[Germanium]] | Fiber optics, IR | ~60% |

## April 2025 controlled elements (refined output share)

*Source: Project Blue*

| Element | [[China]] | Vietnam | Other |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Samarium | ~97% | ~3% | — |
| Gadolinium | ~98% | ~2% | — |
| [[Terbium]] | ~99% | ~1% | — |
| [[Dysprosium]] | ~97% | ~3% | — |
| Lutetium | ~96% | ~2% | [[Japan]] ~2% |
| Yttrium | ~90% | ~5% | [[Japan]], [[Russia]] |
| Scandium | ~80% | — | [[India]] ~10%, [[Russia]] ~10% |

**Key insight:** Vietnam is only meaningful alternative for 6 of 7 elements. Scandium has more diversified supply ([[India]], [[Russia]]).

## Historical precedent

### [[Japan]] dispute (2010)

[[China]] cut rare earth exports to [[Japan]] during Senkaku Islands dispute:
- Prices spiked 10x
- [[Japan]] scrambled for alternatives
- Triggered long-term diversification efforts

### [[Gallium]]/germanium controls (2023)

In response to [[Export controls]] on semiconductors:
- Export licenses required for gallium, germanium
- Targeted chip-related materials
- [[Signal]] of escalation capability

### 2024-2025 escalation

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Dec 2024 | Banned germanium, gallium, antimony sales to US |
| Apr 4, 2025 | Restricted 7 REEs (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) — response to Trump tariffs |
| Oct 9, 2025 | Added 5 more REEs (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) + [[Dutch seizure of Nexperia]] retaliation |
| **June 2025** | Framework agreement — [[China]] said would "review and approve eligible export applications" |
| Oct 2025 | First Chinese use of FDPR — **0.1% threshold**: products overseas need [[China]] approval if ≥0.1% value from controlled REEs |
| Nov 7, 2025 | Suspended controls for 1 year (pause, not reversal) |
| Dec 1, 2025 | Military-affiliated companies denied all export licenses |
| Dec 2025 | Announced silver export controls starting 2026 |

**Key escalation**: October 2025 marked [[China]]'s first use of FDPR — the same extraterritorial mechanism the US uses for semiconductors. Products made outside [[China]] now require licenses if they contain Chinese-origin materials.

**Impact**: European rare earth prices reached 6x Chinese domestic prices. US automakers cut production. No US heavy rare earth separation capacity exists.

**[[Ford]] Chicago shutdown (May 2025):** [[Ford]] closed Chicago plant for several days — couldn't get rare earth magnets for electric motors. First major US production disruption from REE controls.

**[[EU]] impact:** European firms reported several production stoppages from rare earth constraints.

## Why it matters

### Asymmetric power
- West needs rare earths for clean energy transition
- EVs, wind turbines, defense systems all depend on them
- **F-35 requires 900 lbs rare earths** per aircraft
- No short-term substitutes

### Time advantage
- Western mines take 10-15 years to develop
- Processing capacity takes even longer
- [[China]] can impose costs faster than West can adapt

### Escalation risk
- Full embargo would be economic warfare
- But partial restrictions create uncertainty
- Market anticipates and front-runs

## Western response

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| US rare earth mining ([[MP Materials]]) | Small scale |
| **US gallium (ATALCO)** | **$150M Pentagon equity (Jan 2026)** |
| [[Australia]] processing | Early stage |
| [[EU]] Critical Raw Materials Act | Policy phase |
| Recycling programs | Nascent |
| Magnet redesign (less rare earth) | R&D |
| **[[Japan]] deep-sea mining** | Testing (Jan 2026) |

**US permitting reality:** Average 29 years from mineral discovery to production start — longest in world except Zambia.

Timeline to reduce dependence: 10+ years minimum.

---

## Trump administration response (2025-2026)

**Early 2025 actions:**

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **March 2025** | Executive order — wartime emergency powers for critical minerals |
| **April 2025** | Commerce probe launched (270 days to report) |
| **April 2025** | Ukraine critical minerals deal signed |

**National security proclamation (Jan 15, 2026):**

| Policy | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Minimum price guarantees** | Government floor prices for US producers |
| **Allied coordination** | Working with partners on alternative supply chains |
| **Supply chain directive** | Part of broader critical minerals push |

---

## US venture capital surge (2025)

**Record $628M invested in US rare earth startups:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 VC investment | **$628M** |
| Share of global | **90%** |
| vs 2024 | **+2,900%** |

*Source: PitchBook*

**Notable deals (not counting government):**
- [[MP Materials]] — $400M DoD equity (July 2025), $500M [[Apple]] deal
- [[Phoenix Tailings]] — $76M Series B (recycling, zero [[China]] reliance)
- [[Alta Resource Technologies]] — [[DCVC]]-backed (AI + biochemistry separation)

**Key investors:**

| Investor | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| [[DCVC]] | Backed 2 rare earth startups |
| [[Builders Vision]] | [[Phoenix Tailings]] backer (Lukas Walton) |
| [[Khosla Ventures]] | Passed — early stage, high valuations |

**Zachary Bogue ([[DCVC]]):** "Rare earths are top of mind right now. There's geopolitical tensions. The US can no longer rely on [[China]] for rare earths and critical minerals."

---

## Allied coordination (late 2025)

**Trump administration ally deals:**

| Partner | Deal | Timing |
|---------|------|--------|
| **[[Australia]]** | $1B initial + up to $8.5B total potential | Oct 2025 (Trump-PM meeting) |
| **Saudi Arabia** | Pentagon-financed processing site | Nov 2025 |

**Gracelin Baskaran (CSIS):** "It's clear we can't go it alone. The only way to do this is by leaning on our allies."

**Reality:** US geological endowment insufficient — must partner with allies for heavy REEs.

**James Lindsay ([[Builders Vision]]):** Compared to US oil/gas 2005→2015 transformation — "a 15-year cycle has been done before."

---

## Emerging US players

| Company | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[MP Materials]] | Mining, magnets | Only US mine at scale |
| [[Phoenix Tailings]] | Recycling | NH refinery (200 tons/yr), zero [[China]] inputs |
| [[Alta Resource Technologies]] | AI-assisted separation | Targeting cost-competitive by 2027 |

**[[Phoenix Tailings]]:** Producing terbium and dysprosium metals for defense — heavy REEs that US has no other domestic capacity for.

---

## [[Japan]] domestic sourcing attempt

**[[Japan Chikyu rare earth mission 2026-01]]** — World's first attempt to mine rare earths from 6km deep seabed.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Minamitori Island (1,900 km SE of Tokyo) |
| Depth | ~6 km (unprecedented) |
| Investment | 40B yen ($250M) since 2018 |
| Timeline | Test Jan-Feb 2026; full trial Feb 2027 |

**Why it matters**: [[Japan]]'s only path to domestic rare earth production. Would reduce dependence on [[China]] (currently 60%, down from 90% in 2010).

**Challenge**: Previously uneconomical, but [[China]] weaponization of supply may change calculus.

**[[China]] response**: Naval fleet observed near island during June 2025 surveys. Beijing watching closely.

---

## [[Japan]] supply chain impact (Jan 2026)

**Kihara (Chief Cabinet Secretary):** "[[China]]'s export control measures on rare earths and other materials have been ongoing for some time and are having a serious impact on the global supply chain."

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Neodymium magnet lead times | **3-4 months** (from usual 1-2) |
| Customs processing | Lengthened since end of 2025 |
| Japanese firm response | Securing 6+ months inventory |
| Status | Export applications still processing, but slower |

**[[Japan]] allied outreach:** Finance Minister Katayama meeting G7 counterparts on critical minerals; PM Takaichi hosting South Korea's Lee and Italy's Meloni.

See [[China-Japan relations]] for full escalation timeline.

## Investment implications

**Beneficiaries of diversification:**
- Non-[[China]] rare earth miners
- Processing technology companies
- Recycling and urban mining
- Magnet alternatives research

**At-risk sectors:**
- EV manufacturers (supply chain vulnerability)
- Wind turbine producers
- [[Defense]] contractors
- **Semiconductor equipment** ([[ASML]] High-NA EUV needs Dy/Tb magnets)
- Any company with rare earth-intensive products

---

## Semiconductor equipment vector

A less obvious but critical dependency:

| Equipment | REE role |
|-----------|----------|
| [[ASML]] High-NA EUV | Dy/Tb magnets for wafer/reticle stage positioning |
| Precision actuators | Nanometer-scale motion control |

**The chain**: [[China]] REE controls → ASML production bottleneck → [[1.4nm race]] delays → AI chip supply constrained

**Mitigation (Dec 2025)**: REAlloys $21M SRC deal to scale North American heavy REE output 300% by 2027 — specifically for semiconductor equipment magnets.
