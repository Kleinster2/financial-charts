# Samsung memory vs SK Hynix: which is the better memory play?

---

## The tension

Both benefit from [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]], but different exposures:

| Factor | [[Samsung]] | [[SK Hynix]] |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| HBM position | #2, catching up | #1, NVIDIA locked |
| General DRAM | Higher share | Lower share (HBM-centric) |
| Near-term margins | May benefit more from DDR5 | HBM margins may be capped |
| Foundry | Drag on earnings | N/A (pure memory) |
| Execution | Mixed (foundry struggles) | Strong (M15X 2 months early) |

## The Samsung problem

Memory earnings bundled with foundry losses:
- Foundry at 6.8% share, losing money
- Conglomerate discount
- Hard to get pure memory exposure

Even if Samsung memory outperforms, stock may not reflect it.

## The SK Hynix risk

All-in on HBM:
- If general DRAM margins exceed HBM (UBS view), SK Hynix misses upside
- HBM has structural cost issues (foundry base die, packaging, yields)
- Less flexibility than Samsung's mix strategy

But: HBM leadership has strategic value beyond near-term margins.

## Current view

**Not a clean pair trade.** Both win in memory shortage. The question is relative outperformance:

- **Near-term (2025-2026)**: Samsung may have more earnings leverage from general DRAM
- **Long-term**: HBM leadership (SK Hynix) probably matters more for AI era
- **Stock expression**: Samsung's foundry drag complicates the memory thesis

If forced to choose pure memory exposure: **SK Hynix** for HBM leadership, accept the concentration risk.

If want diversified + value angle: **Samsung** memory earnings may surprise, but foundry drag is real.
