**Status**: Open

## The question

Can any competitor realistically challenge [[TSMC]]'s dominance in advanced logic foundry within 10 years?

## Arguments for durability

- [[Customer lock-in via co-design]] creates multi-year switching costs
- [[Yield as competitive moat]] — accumulated learning is hard to replicate
- ~60% market share generates cash for continued R&D leadership
- [[Why TSMC can afford patience]] — positional advantage compounds

## Arguments against durability

- [[Taiwan concentration risk]] could trigger forced customer diversification
- [[CHIPS Act]] subsidies artificially boost competitors
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] or [[Samsung]] could achieve breakthrough execution
- Geopolitical pressure may override pure economics

## What to watch

- [ ] Arizona yields — do they match Taiwan within 2 years?
- [ ] Major customer defection to Samsung/Intel
- [ ] Intel 18A execution
- [ ] China tensions escalation

## Current view

Durable for 5+ years absent Taiwan disruption. 10-year outlook depends on geopolitics more than competition.
