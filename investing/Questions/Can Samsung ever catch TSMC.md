**Status**: Open

## The question

Is there any realistic path for [[Samsung]] foundry to achieve parity with [[TSMC]]?

## Paths that could work

1. **Taiwan disruption** — exogenous shock revalues Samsung's U.S. capacity
2. **Sustained yield improvement** — 70%+ at 2nm by mid-2026 would validate the bet
3. **Major customer win** — landing Apple/NVIDIA/AMD volume would signal credibility
4. **TSMC stumbles** — Arizona execution problems or Taiwan grid failures

## Paths that probably won't work

- Incremental improvement from #2 position (see [[Why TSMC can afford patience]])
- Cost competition (similar equipment costs)
- Subsidies alone (TSMC gets them too)

## What the [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] tells us

Samsung is betting on path #1 or #2. The pivot is either:
- A catastrophic self-inflicted wound, OR
- Rational asymmetric betting (see [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]])

## Current view

Unlikely without exogenous shock. Samsung's best realistic outcome is "credible #2" that captures geopolitically-constrained customers.
