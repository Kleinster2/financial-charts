**Status**: Open

## The question

Can [[Intel Foundry Services]] become a credible third force in advanced foundry?

## What success looks like

- Intel 18A launches on schedule with competitive yields (2025)
- Major external customer win (Qualcomm, AMD, or NVIDIA volume)
- $20B+ foundry revenue by 2030
- Stock re-rates as strategic asset

## What failure looks like

- Continued node delays
- No major customer wins by 2027
- Activist pressure forces spinoff/shutdown
- Foundry remains a cost center subsidized by legacy business

## Key uncertainties

- **Cultural transformation**: Can an IDM become customer-service oriented?
- **Internal vs external tension**: Will Intel's own products cannibalize foundry attention?
- **Subsidy dependency**: Do economics ever work without government support?

## What to watch

- [ ] Intel 18A timeline and yields
- [ ] First major external customer announcement
- [ ] Ohio/Arizona fab ramp progress
- [ ] Activist investor activity

## Current view

More likely to fail than succeed. But if it works, it's transformational for Intel and for U.S. semiconductor sovereignty.
