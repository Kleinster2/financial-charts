## The question

What are the second-order effects of a Taiwan semiconductor disruption (blockade, invasion, infrastructure destruction)?

## Immediate effects

- ~90% of advanced chip production halted
- Global electronics supply chain collapses
- [[TSMC]] potentially existential (see [[Taiwan concentration risk]])

## Who benefits

- [[Samsung]] — U.S. capacity suddenly strategic
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] — domestic production premium
- Any fab outside Taiwan Strait

## Who loses

- [[TSMC]] — core assets at risk
- Apple, NVIDIA, AMD — supply concentration backfires
- Global economy — severe recession likely

## Mitigation status

| Actor | Mitigation | Adequacy |
|-------|------------|----------|
| TSMC | [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] | ~5% of capacity — inadequate |
| Samsung | [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] | Potentially first U.S. 2nm — valuable |
| Intel | Ohio/Arizona fabs | Still ramping |

## Current view

This is underpriced tail risk. Arizona fabs are "insurance" but the coverage is thin. A real disruption revalues Samsung and Intel dramatically.
