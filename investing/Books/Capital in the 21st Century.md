# Capital in the Twenty-First Century

**Author:** Thomas Piketty
**Published:** 2013 (French), 2014 (English)
**Awards:** Global bestseller, sparked international debate on inequality

Piketty's thesis: when the return on capital (r) exceeds economic growth (g), wealth concentrates inexorably. This is capitalism's default state—the relative equality of the mid-20th century was an aberration caused by wars and policy, not a natural tendency. Without intervention (global wealth taxes), democracy itself is threatened.

## Central thesis: r > g

**The fundamental force for divergence.**

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **r** | Return on capital (profits, dividends, interest, rents) |
| **g** | Economic growth rate (income/output) |

When r > g persistently, wealth accumulates faster from capital ownership than from labor. The rich get richer automatically; workers fall behind.

**Historical rates:**
- r has averaged 4-5% for most of human history
- g hovered near 0% until the Industrial Revolution
- g spiked to ~4% mid-20th century, now falling back toward 1-2%

As g falls (aging populations, slower productivity), r > g widens.

## Key arguments

### 1. Mid-century equality was an exception

The relatively equal period (1914-1980) resulted from:
- Two world wars destroying capital
- High taxes on wealth and inheritance
- Strong unions and labor share
- Rapid growth (catching up after wars)

This was not capitalism's natural state—it was a historical anomaly.

### 2. Wealth concentration is returning

Without the "shocks" of war and Depression-era policy, capitalism reverts to 19th-century inequality patterns. We are witnessing this reversion now.

### 3. Inheritance dominates

As r > g persists, inherited wealth matters more than earned income. Piketty calls this "patrimonial capitalism"—a return to Balzac's world where marrying well beats working hard.

### 4. Democracy is threatened

Extreme wealth concentration undermines democratic governance. The wealthy capture political processes, further entrenching inequality.

## Proposed solution

**Global progressive wealth tax.**

Piketty acknowledges this is utopian but argues it's the only structural solution. Income taxes are insufficient because wealth compounds untaxed.

## Critiques

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Matthew Rognlie (MIT)** | Most of the capital share increase is housing/land, not productive capital |
| **Carlos Góes (IMF)** | Empirical test found r > g didn't predict inequality in 75% of countries |
| **Piketty's response** | Critics measured income inequality, not wealth; used wrong r proxy |

The housing critique is significant: if rising wealth concentration is mostly house prices, policy implications differ (land value tax vs wealth tax).

## Investment relevance

| Implication | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| Capital outperforms labor long-term | Own assets, not just earn wages |
| Real estate as wealth driver | Housing exposure matters |
| Policy risk to wealth | Wealth taxes increasingly discussed |
| Inheritance matters | Dynastic wealth persists |
| Political instability | Inequality → populism → policy volatility |

## Data contribution

Piketty's lasting contribution may be the **World Inequality Database** (wid.world)—comprehensive historical data on wealth and income distribution across countries. This infrastructure enables ongoing research.
