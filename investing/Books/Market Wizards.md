# Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders

**Author:** Jack D. Schwager
**Published:** 1989
**Series:** First of four Market Wizards books

The book that defined trader interviews as a genre. Schwager talked to the most successful traders of the 1980s—futures traders, stock traders, discretionary and systematic—and extracted their principles. The result is a mosaic of different approaches united by common psychological traits.

## Core thesis

> "There is no single formula for trading success. But there are common traits among winners: discipline, risk management, independence, and the ability to learn from mistakes."

The key finding:
- Trading styles vary enormously (trend-following, contrarian, fundamental, technical)
- Psychological traits are consistent (discipline, emotional control, self-awareness)
- Risk management is universal (all protect capital first)
- No one approach works for everyone (find what fits your personality)

## Notable interviews

### Ed Seykota

The most philosophical trader. Pioneered computerized trend-following in the 1970s.

> "The elements of good trading are: (1) cutting losses, (2) cutting losses, and (3) cutting losses."

> "Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. Some people seem to like to lose."

### Bruce Kovner

Macro trader who went from cab driver to billionaire. Founded Caxton Associates.

> "Michael Marcus taught me one thing: if you're not sure, don't trade. Wait for the fat pitch."

> "Risk control is the most important thing in trading."

### Paul Tudor Jones

Macro legend who called the 1987 crash.

> "Don't focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have."

> "At the end of the day, the most important thing is how good you are at risk control."

### Richard Dennis

Trend-following legend who made $200M+ from a $400 start. Famous for the Turtle experiment.

> "I always say you could publish trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them."

The Turtle experiment: Dennis bet he could teach trading. He trained 23 people with specific rules. They made $175M in five years.

## The psychology

### What separates winners from losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| Accept losses as cost of business | Fight losses; hold hoping |
| Follow their system | Override rules emotionally |
| Size positions conservatively | Bet too big |
| Learn from mistakes | Repeat mistakes |
| Patient; wait for opportunities | Overtrade |

### The emotional challenge

> "The market is designed to fool most of the people most of the time." —Jesse Livermore (quoted by Schwager)

| Emotion | Danger |
|---------|--------|
| Fear | Miss opportunities; cut winners early |
| Greed | Overtrade; hold too long |
| Hope | Don't cut losses |
| Regret | Chase missed moves |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk management first** | Survival enables compounding |
| **Find your style** | No universal approach; fit personality |
| **Discipline > intelligence** | Execution beats analysis |
| **Independence required** | You can't follow others to success |
| **Process over outcome** | Right process with bad outcome beats wrong process with good outcome |

### For non-traders

Even long-term investors can learn:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cut losses | Don't hold losers hoping |
| Size appropriately | Don't bet too big on any position |
| Have a plan | Know your buy/sell criteria |
| Control emotions | Don't panic sell or FOMO buy |
