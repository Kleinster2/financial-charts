# Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger

**Editor:** Peter D. Kaufman
**Published:** 2005 (expanded editions 2006, 2008)
**Format:** Collection of speeches, talks, and commentary

Charlie Munger's worldview distilled—part investment philosophy, part life manual, part intellectual toolkit. The book collects Munger's famous speeches and adds extensive commentary on his "mental models" approach to thinking. More than an investment book, it's a guide to rational decision-making.

## Core thesis

> "You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models."

Munger's approach:
- Build a "latticework" of mental models from multiple disciplines
- Use them to see reality more clearly than specialists
- Avoid psychological biases that distort judgment
- Think independently; ignore conventional wisdom when wrong

---

## The mental models

### The latticework concept

| Discipline | Key models |
|------------|------------|
| **Mathematics** | Compound interest, probability, inversion |
| **Physics** | Critical mass, equilibrium, feedback loops |
| **Biology** | Evolution, natural selection, adaptation |
| **Psychology** | Cognitive biases, incentives, social proof |
| **Economics** | Opportunity cost, marginal utility, moats |
| **Engineering** | Redundancy, margin of safety, breakpoints |

**The insight:** Reality doesn't respect academic boundaries. To understand it, you need tools from everywhere.

### Key models explained

#### Inversion

> "Invert, always invert."

| Forward thinking | Inverted thinking |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "How do I succeed?" | "How would I fail?" |
| "What should I do?" | "What should I avoid?" |
| "How do I get rich?" | "How do I go broke?" |

**Application:** Avoid stupidity rather than seeking brilliance.

#### Circle of competence

| Inside circle | Outside circle |
|---------------|----------------|
| What you truly understand | What you think you understand |
| Where you have edge | Where others have edge |
| Where to bet big | Where to avoid |

**The key:** Know the boundaries. Most mistakes come from straying outside.

#### Incentives

> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

| Principle | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| People respond to incentives | Sales commissions drive behavior |
| Incentives can corrupt | Auditors paid by clients they audit |
| Design systems for good incentives | Munger's first question about any business |

#### Opportunity cost

| Every choice | Has a cost |
|--------------|------------|
| Buying stock A | Means not buying stock B |
| Holding cash | Means missing returns |
| Time on project X | Means not doing project Y |

**Munger's use:** Every investment competes against the best alternative.

## The psychology of misjudgment

Munger's famous speech identifies 25 cognitive biases:

| Bias | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Incentive-caused bias** | Self-interest distorts perception |
| **Liking/loving tendency** | We favor what we like |
| **Disliking/hating tendency** | We disfavor what we dislike |
| **Doubt-avoidance** | Rush to decision to eliminate uncertainty |
| **Inconsistency-avoidance** | Resist changing views |
| **Curiosity tendency** | We seek novelty |
| **Kantian fairness** | We expect reciprocity |
| **Envy/jealousy** | We compare ourselves to others |
| **Reciprocation** | We return favors (and slights) |
| **Social proof** | We follow the crowd |
| **Contrast-caused distortion** | We judge by comparison, not absolute |
| **Stress-induced irrationality** | Pressure impairs judgment |
| **Availability bias** | We overweight easily recalled info |
| **Authority bias** | We defer to perceived authorities |
| **Twaddle tendency** | We generate noise to seem active |
| **Reason-respecting** | We want explanations, even bad ones |
| **Lollapalooza effects** | Multiple biases combine catastrophically |

## The investment philosophy

### Munger vs. Graham

| Graham | Munger |
|--------|--------|
| Quantitative | Qualitative |
| Cheap cigar butts | Wonderful businesses |
| Diversify | Concentrate |
| Trade | Hold forever |

**Munger's influence on Buffett:** Shifted Berkshire from buying cheap mediocrities to owning great businesses.

### What Munger looks for

| Quality | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Durable competitive advantage** | Pricing power, moat |
| **Able management** | Capital allocation skill |
| **Good economics** | High returns on capital |
| **Reasonable price** | Margin of safety |
| **Simple business** | Understandable |

### What Munger avoids

| Red flag | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Complexity | Can't understand = can't value |
| High debt | Fragility |
| Bad management | Can't fix |
| Outside circle of competence | No edge |
| Fashionable investments | Likely overpriced |

## Life philosophy

### On reading

> "In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time—none, zero."

| Habit | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| Read constantly | Multiple hours daily |
| Read broadly | Not just finance |
| Read history | "The best teacher" |
| Read biographies | "Learn from others' lives" |

### On avoiding stupidity

> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

| Smart approach | Munger approach |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Find great ideas | Avoid terrible ideas |
| Hit home runs | Don't strike out |
| Be brilliant | Be rational |

### On patience

> "The big money is not in the buying and the selling, but in the waiting."

---

## Famous quotes

> "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome."

> "A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price."

> "Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom."

> "Take a simple idea and take it seriously."

> "The iron rule of nature is: you get what you reward for."

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mental models** | Build cross-disciplinary toolkit |
| **Psychology awareness** | Know your biases |
| **Quality over cheapness** | Great businesses compound |
| **Patience** | Wait for fat pitches |
| **Circle of competence** | Stay where you have edge |
| **Inversion** | Avoid mistakes first |

## The Munger checklist

Before any investment:

1. Can I understand this business?
2. Does it have durable competitive advantages?
3. Is management able and honest?
4. Is the price reasonable?
5. What could go wrong? (Inversion)
6. Is this within my circle of competence?
7. What's the opportunity cost?
