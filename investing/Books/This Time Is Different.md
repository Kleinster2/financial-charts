# This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly

**Authors:** Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff
**Published:** 2009
**Recognition:** Definitive empirical study of financial crises

The most comprehensive study of financial crises ever compiled—covering 66 countries over 800 years. Reinhart and Rogoff's thesis: financial crises follow predictable patterns, yet each generation believes "this time is different." It never is. The data shows debt crises, banking panics, and sovereign defaults recur with depressing regularity.

## Core thesis

> "The essence of the this-time-is-different syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times; crises do not happen to us, here and now."

The patterns:
- Debt builds up during good times
- Everyone believes the boom is permanent
- Crisis arrives; everyone is shocked
- Amnesia sets in; cycle repeats

## The database

| Coverage | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| Countries | 66 |
| Time span | 800 years (1200s-2000s) |
| Crises catalogued | Hundreds |
| Data series | Debt, defaults, banking crises, inflation, exchange rates |

**The achievement:** No one had compiled this data before. The book created the empirical foundation for studying financial crises.

## Types of crises

### 1. Sovereign debt crises

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Serial defaulters exist | Spain defaulted 13 times; Latin America repeatedly |
| "Graduation" is rare | Few countries permanently escape default risk |
| Debt thresholds matter | Crisis risk rises sharply above certain debt/GDP levels |

**The 90% threshold:** Rogoff and Reinhart found growth slows significantly when government debt exceeds 90% of GDP. (This finding was later controversial—see critiques below.)

### 2. Banking crises

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Precede or follow sovereign crises | Banking stress and government stress feed each other |
| Asset bubbles precede | Real estate and equity bubbles common |
| Credit booms warn | Rapid credit growth is the best predictor |
| Recovery is slow | Average: 4-6 years to recover pre-crisis output |

### 3. Currency crises

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Often linked to debt crises | Default → devaluation |
| Contagion spreads | Regional clustering is common |
| Inflation follows | Printing money to pay debts |

### 4. Inflation crises

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Debt erosion tool | Inflation reduces real debt burden |
| Politically easier | Than explicit default |
| Eventually ends badly | Hyperinflation destroys economies |

## Key findings

### The "this time is different" syndrome

| Claimed difference | Historical reality |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "We have better institutions" | Said before every crisis |
| "Financial innovation reduces risk" | Often increases it |
| "Our debt is sustainable" | Until it isn't |
| "We're not like those other countries" | Data says otherwise |

### Warning signs

| Indicator | What it predicts |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Rapid credit growth | Banking crisis |
| Current account deficits | Currency crisis |
| High government debt | Sovereign crisis |
| Asset price bubbles | All of the above |

### Recovery patterns

| Crisis type | Average recovery time |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Banking crisis | 4-6 years |
| Severe banking crisis | 7-10 years |
| Sovereign default | Varies widely |

## The 2008 crisis in context

Reinhart and Rogoff published in 2009, just after the financial crisis:

| 2008 parallel | Historical precedent |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Housing bubble | Japan 1990s, Nordic 1990s, US 1930s |
| Banking collapse | 1930s, 1907, countless others |
| Credit freeze | Standard banking crisis pattern |
| Government response | Bailouts recur throughout history |

**Their prediction (correct):** Recovery would be slow—more like post-banking-crisis pattern than typical recession.

---

## The controversy

### The Excel error (2013)

Graduate student Thomas Herndon found:

| Error | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Excel formula excluded data | Some high-debt/high-growth countries omitted |
| Coding mistake | Affected the 90% threshold finding |

**The fallout:**
- The specific "90% threshold" claim was weakened
- Core findings (crises recur, debt matters) remained valid
- Became a case study in research replication

### Austerity debate

| Critics said | Reinhart/Rogoff said |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Book justified austerity | We never prescribed policy |
| 90% threshold was misused | Politicians oversimplified |
| Causation unclear | We showed correlation; others assumed causation |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Crises recur** | Don't assume "this time is different" |
| **Debt levels matter** | Watch government and private debt/GDP |
| **Credit booms warn** | Rapid lending growth precedes crises |
| **Recovery is slow** | Plan for multi-year drawdowns |
| **Contagion happens** | Regional crises spread |

### Indicators to monitor

| Signal | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Private credit/GDP growth | >10% annual increase |
| Current account deficit | >5% of GDP |
| Real estate prices | >50% above trend |
| Government debt/GDP | Rising trajectory |

## The data legacy

The book's real contribution is the database:

| Resource | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Sovereign default dates | Emerging market risk |
| Banking crisis dates | Financial cycle research |
| Debt/GDP series | Historical comparisons |
| Exchange rate regimes | Currency analysis |

Researchers still use this data for crisis studies.
