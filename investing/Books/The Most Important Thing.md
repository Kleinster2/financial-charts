# The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor

**Author:** Howard Marks
**Published:** 2011
**Origin:** Compiled from Marks's client memos at Oaktree Capital

Howard Marks distills decades of investing wisdom into a single book. Each chapter covers something that is "the most important thing"—because everything is the most important thing at some point. The book is particularly valuable for its framework on risk, market cycles, and the psychology of contrarian investing.

## Core thesis

> "There's no single most important thing—investing requires simultaneous attention to many factors. But risk control is always paramount."

Marks's framework:
- Risk comes from paying too much, not from volatility
- Markets are cyclical; position accordingly
- Second-level thinking separates winners from losers
- Being contrarian is necessary but not sufficient

---

## Second-level thinking

| First-level thinking | Second-level thinking |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "It's a good company, let's buy" | "It's a good company, but everyone knows it, so it's overpriced" |
| "Economy is weak, sell" | "Economy is weak, everyone's panicking, prices are too low" |
| "Earnings will fall, sell" | "Earnings will fall less than feared, the stock is cheap" |

**The insight:** First-level thinking gets you average returns. Second-level thinking—asking "what do others think, and why are they wrong?"—is required for outperformance.

## The chapters

### 1. Second-level thinking (above)

### 2. Understanding market efficiency

| Market | Efficiency |
|--------|------------|
| Large-cap US stocks | Very efficient |
| Small-caps, emerging markets | Less efficient |
| Distressed debt | Inefficient |
| Private markets | Very inefficient |

**Marks's view:** Markets are "efficient enough" that beating them requires either superior insight or willingness to look where others don't.

### 3. Value

> "For a value investor, price has to be the starting point."

| Intrinsic value | Market price |
|-----------------|--------------|
| What something is worth | What you pay |
| Relatively stable | Highly volatile |
| Your estimate | The market's estimate |

**The opportunity:** When price diverges far from value.

### 4. The relationship between price and value

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price << value | Buy aggressively |
| Price < value | Buy |
| Price ≈ value | Hold |
| Price > value | Sell |
| Price >> value | Sell aggressively |

### 5. Understanding risk

> "Risk means more things can happen than will happen."

| Common view | Marks's view |
|-------------|--------------|
| Risk = volatility | Risk = probability of permanent loss |
| Measured by beta | Measured by margin of safety |
| Backward-looking | Forward-looking |

**The key insight:** Risk is highest when everyone thinks it's lowest (prices are high) and lowest when everyone thinks it's highest (prices are low).

### 6. Recognizing risk

| When risk is high | Signs |
|-------------------|-------|
| Prices are elevated | High multiples |
| Optimism prevails | "This time is different" |
| Credit is loose | Anyone can borrow |
| Skepticism is absent | Bears are mocked |

### 7. Controlling risk

> "Risk control is invisible in good times but essential in bad times."

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Margin of safety | Don't pay too much |
| Diversification | Don't concentrate too much |
| Avoid leverage | Don't borrow too much |
| Skepticism | Don't believe too much |

### 8. Being attentive to cycles

> "Rule number one: most things are cyclical. Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities come when people forget rule number one."

| Cycle phase | Investor behavior |
|-------------|------------------|
| Bottom | Despair; best time to buy |
| Recovery | Skepticism; still good to buy |
| Expansion | Optimism; hold |
| Peak | Euphoria; time to sell |
| Decline | Denial, then panic; hold cash |

### 9. Awareness of the pendulum

Markets swing between:

| Extreme | Extreme |
|---------|---------|
| Euphoria | Depression |
| Greed | Fear |
| Risk tolerance | Risk aversion |
| Credulous | Skeptical |

**The pendulum:** It spends little time at the midpoint. Most of the time it's swinging toward one extreme or the other.

### 10-21. Additional chapters

| Topic | Key point |
|-------|-----------|
| Combating negative influences | Control your emotions |
| Contrarianism | Necessary but not sufficient |
| Finding bargains | Look where others won't |
| Patient opportunism | Wait for fat pitches |
| Knowing what you don't know | Humility |
| Having a sense for where we stand | Cycle awareness |
| Appreciating the role of luck | Distinguish skill from fortune |
| Investing defensively | Focus on not losing |
| Avoiding pitfalls | Don't force it |
| Adding value | Alpha is hard |
| Reasonable expectations | Don't expect miracles |

---

## On contrarianism

> "To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward."

| Being contrarian | Is not enough |
|------------------|---------------|
| Buying when others sell | Must be right about value |
| Going against consensus | Consensus is often correct |
| Being different | Must be different AND better |

---

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Second-level thinking** | Ask what others think, then why they're wrong |
| **Risk ≠ volatility** | Risk is permanent loss, not price fluctuation |
| **Cycles are inevitable** | Position for where we are in the cycle |
| **Contrarianism is necessary** | But not sufficient |
| **Margin of safety** | The best risk control |
| **Know what you don't know** | Humility prevents disasters |
