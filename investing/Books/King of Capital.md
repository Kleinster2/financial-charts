## Core thesis

> "Private equity went from being a cottage industry of deal makers to a systematic asset class managing trillions of dollars—and Blackstone led that transformation."

The evolution:
- 1980s: LBOs as corporate raids
- 1990s: Operational improvement focus
- 2000s: Institutional acceptance, mega-funds
- 2007: Blackstone IPO—PE becomes permanent

## The founders

### Steve Schwarzman

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Relentless ambition | "I want war, not a series of skirmishes" |
| Detail-oriented | Reviews every deal memo personally |
| Networker | Built relationships across business and politics |
| Insecurity-driven | Fear of failure as motivation |

### Pete Peterson

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Gravitas | Former Commerce Secretary, Lehman CEO |
| Credibility | Opened doors Schwarzman couldn't |
| Different focus | Policy, public issues, fiscal responsibility |
| Exit | Sold stake, focused on Peterson Foundation |

**The partnership:** Peterson provided credibility and access; Schwarzman provided drive and deal-making. They complemented perfectly—until they didn't need each other.

---

## The founding (1985)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Origin | Schwarzman and Peterson left Lehman |
| Initial capital | $400,000 of their own money |
| First office | Tiny space; just the two of them |
| Strategy | Advisory fees → build fund → do deals |

**The key insight:** Start with advisory work (no capital required), build relationships, then raise a fund.

## Key deals

### Landmark transactions

| Year | Deal | Innovation |
|------|------|------------|
| **1989** | CNW Railroad | First major Blackstone-led buyout |
| **1995** | Six Flags | Theme parks; operational turnaround |
| **2004** | Celanese | $3B deal; returned 2.6x |
| **2006** | Equity Office Properties | $39B—largest LBO ever at time |
| **2007** | Hilton Hotels | $26B; poorly timed but eventually profitable |

### Equity Office Properties (2006-2007)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Price | $39B (largest PE deal ever) |
| Timing | Peak of real estate bubble |
| Schwarzman's move | Sold half the assets within months |
| Result | Avoided disaster through rapid asset sales |

**The lesson:** Even at the peak, brilliant execution matters.

### Hilton (2007)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Price | $26B |
| Timing | Just before 2008 crisis |
| Initial result | Stock crashed; deal looked disastrous |
| Long-term | Restructured, improved operations, IPO'd profitably |

**The lesson:** PE's long holding period allows recovery from bad timing.

## The business model

### How PE makes money

| Fee type | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Management fee | 1.5-2% of committed capital | Pay salaries, overhead |
| Carried interest | 20% of profits above hurdle | Alignment with investors |
| Transaction fees | Variable | Deal origination, monitoring |

### The value creation playbook

| Lever | How it works |
|-------|-------------|
| **Leverage** | Debt amplifies equity returns |
| **Operational improvement** | Cut costs, grow revenue |
| **Multiple expansion** | Buy cheap, sell expensive |
| **Financial engineering** | Dividend recaps, tax optimization |

---

## The IPO (2007)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Date | June 2007 |
| Valuation | $33B |
| Schwarzman's stake | ~$8B |
| Criticism | Timing (peak of cycle), tax treatment |

**The controversy:**
- Critics said PE shouldn't be public (misaligned incentives)
- Carried interest taxed as capital gains, not income
- IPO price crashed in 2008; took years to recover

---

## The 2008 crisis

| Impact | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Portfolio company values crashed | Renegotiate debt, inject capital |
| Fund returns turned negative | Wait for recovery |
| Public stock collapsed | Long-term holders eventually profited |
| Industry scrutiny intensified | Schwarzman became political target |

**The survival:** Blackstone survived because:
- Diversified across asset classes
- Long-term capital (locked up for years)
- Operational expertise to fix troubled companies

---

## The transformation

| Old PE (1980s-1990s) | New PE (2000s+) |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Deal-by-deal | Platform companies |
| Financial engineering | Operational improvement |
| Boom-bust | Permanent capital |
| Controversial raiders | Institutional asset class |
| Billions | Trillions |

**Blackstone's expansion:**

| Business | AUM |
|----------|-----|
| Private equity | Core business |
| Real estate | Largest in the world |
| Credit | Major player |
| Hedge fund solutions | Fund of funds |
| Infrastructure | Growing |

---

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Permanent capital wins** | Long lock-ups enable patient investing |
| **Operational value creation** | Financial engineering alone isn't enough |
| **Diversification across strategies** | Blackstone isn't just PE anymore |
| **Relationships compound** | Schwarzman's network is a moat |
| **Timing matters less with patience** | Hilton looked disastrous, then wasn't |

### The PE return question

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "PE beats public markets" | After fees, debatable |
| "PE creates operational value" | Sometimes; sometimes just leverage |
| "PE alignment is better" | Carry creates alignment, but also risk-taking |

---

## Schwarzman today

| Metric | Scale (as of 2024) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Blackstone AUM | $1+ trillion |
| Schwarzman net worth | ~$40B |
| Philanthropy | Schwarzman Scholars, buildings, donations |
| Political influence | Both parties; controversial |
