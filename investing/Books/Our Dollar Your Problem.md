# Our Dollar, Your Problem: An Insider's View of Seven Turbulent Decades of Global Finance, and the Road Ahead

**Author:** Kenneth Rogoff
**Published:** May 2025
**Publisher:** Yale University Press
**Recognition:** National Bestseller; FT "Best Summer Books 2025: Economics"

Rogoff's insider account of the dollar's postwar dominance—and warning that it may be ending. Drawing on his experience as IMF chief economist and decades of research, he argues the dollar's rise involved more luck than commonly acknowledged, and that a convergence of forces now threatens its primacy.

## Core thesis

> "America's currency might not have reached today's lofty pinnacle without a certain amount of good luck."

The argument:
- Dollar dominance wasn't inevitable—it beat out competitors through circumstance as much as design
- The era of low inflation, low rates, and low volatility is ending
- Multiple challenges are converging simultaneously
- Dollar hegemony will diminish, though not disappear

## The dollar's postwar run

### Competitors it defeated

| Challenger | Era | Why it failed |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| **Soviet ruble** | Cold War | Command economy collapsed |
| **Japanese yen** | 1980s | Plaza Accord, lost decade, demographics |
| **Euro** | 2000s-2010s | Eurozone crisis; no fiscal union |
| **SDR** | Various | No real constituency |

### Why the dollar won

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| US economic size | Largest economy post-WWII |
| Deep capital markets | Treasury market liquidity |
| Rule of law | Contract enforcement, property rights |
| Military dominance | Security umbrella for allies |
| Network effects | Once dominant, hard to displace |
| Luck | Competitors self-destructed |

## The challenges ahead

### 1. Chinese yuan / renminbi

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Economic size | China approaching US GDP |
| Capital controls | Still significant barrier |
| Rule of law | Markets don't trust CCP |
| BRICS push | Dedollarization rhetoric |
| Rogoff's view | Threat is real but yuan not ready |

### 2. Cryptocurrency

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bitcoin as reserve | Too volatile currently |
| Stablecoins | Dollar-backed (reinforces dollar) |
| CBDCs | Could fragment system |
| Long-term | Wildcards that could disrupt |

### 3. End of low rates/inflation

| Old regime | New regime |
|------------|------------|
| Low inflation | Higher, more volatile |
| Low rates | Structurally higher |
| Stable dollar | More volatility |
| Easy funding | Fiscal constraints matter |

### 4. Political instability

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Weaponization of dollar | Sanctions push rivals away |
| Fiscal dysfunction | Debt ceiling crises |
| Fed independence threats | Credibility questions |
| Isolationism | Allies seek alternatives |

### 5. Fracturing of dollar bloc

| Traditional bloc | Erosion |
|------------------|---------|
| Europe, Japan, allies | Still in bloc |
| Gulf states | Hedging toward China |
| Global South | BRICS, local currency trade |
| Russia | Forced out by sanctions |

## Rogoff's insider perspective

Drawing from his career:

| Experience | Insight |
|------------|---------|
| IMF chief economist (2001-03) | Saw currency crises firsthand |
| Policymaker access | Understands decision-making |
| Academic research | *This Time Is Different* data |
| Chess grandmaster | Strategic/game theory lens |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dollar dominance not permanent** | Don't assume USD always safe haven |
| **Transition will be gradual** | No sudden collapse; slow erosion |
| **Volatility returning** | FX risk matters again |
| **Alternatives limited** | Yuan not ready; euro flawed; crypto immature |
| **Sanctions have costs** | Weaponization accelerates dedollarization |

### Portfolio implications

| Scenario | Positioning |
|----------|-------------|
| Dollar erosion | Diversify currency exposure |
| Higher rate volatility | Duration risk matters |
| Yuan rise | EM exposure, but with hedges |
| Crypto disruption | Small allocation as option |

## The title's origin

"Our dollar, your problem" — a twist on Treasury Secretary John Connally's famous 1971 quip to European finance ministers:

> "The dollar is our currency, but it's your problem."

Rogoff's inversion suggests the dollar's problems are becoming America's problems too.

## Critical reception

| Reviewer | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Martin Wolf** (FT) | "In this brilliant book, Rogoff warns that the primacy of the dollar is at risk" |
| **Fareed Zakaria** (WaPo) | "worries that we are jeopardizing the dollar's pivotal role" |
