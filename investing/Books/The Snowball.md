## Core thesis

> "Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill."

Buffett's success comes from:
- Starting early (first stock at age 11)
- Compounding relentlessly (never stopping)
- Finding the right environment (wet snow = good opportunities)
- Time (the long hill)

## The early years

### The numbers kid

| Age | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| 6 | Sold Coca-Cola door to door |
| 11 | Bought first stock (Cities Service) |
| 13 | Filed first tax return; deducted bicycle as business expense |
| 14 | Bought 40 acres of farmland |
| 16 | Had saved $5,000 (~$70,000 today) |

**The insight:** Buffett was obsessed with numbers and money from childhood. Not for spending—for accumulating.

### The formative influences

| Person | Lesson |
|--------|--------|
| **Howard Buffett** (father) | Integrity, independence, Republican values |
| **Benjamin Graham** | Value investing; margin of safety |
| **Charlie Munger** | Quality over cheapness; mental models |
| **Susie Buffett** (wife) | Emotional intelligence; philanthropy |

## The investing evolution

### Graham phase (1950s-1960s)

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| "Cigar butts" | Buy cheap companies; extract one last puff |
| Net-net investing | Buy below liquidation value |
| Quantitative | Spreadsheet-driven; ignore management |

**The partnership:** Buffett Partnership Ltd. (1956-1969) compounded at 29.5% annually vs. 7.4% for the Dow.

### Munger phase (1970s+)

| Old Buffett | New Buffett |
|-------------|-------------|
| Buy fair companies at wonderful prices | Buy wonderful companies at fair prices |
| Liquidation value | Franchise value |
| Ignore management | Management matters |
| Trade actively | Hold forever |

**The shift:** Munger convinced Buffett that paying up for quality beats buying cheap mediocrity.

### The Berkshire model

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Insurance float | Free leverage from premiums |
| Cash generation | Operating companies fund acquisitions |
| Decentralization | Managers run their businesses |
| Permanent capital | No redemptions; infinite time horizon |
| Tax efficiency | Hold, don't sell; defer gains |

## Key deals

| Year | Deal | Lesson |
|------|------|--------|
| **1965** | Berkshire Hathaway | Mistake—textiles were dying |
| **1967** | National Indemnity | Insurance float model begins |
| **1972** | See's Candies | First "wonderful company" at fair price |
| **1988** | Coca-Cola | $1B → $25B+; brand as moat |
| **1998** | Gen Re | Giant insurance; problematic integration |
| **2009** | Burlington Northern | Bet on America; $34B |
| **2016** | Apple | Largest position ever; $35B → $150B+ |

## The personal life

### The contradictions

| Public image | Private reality |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Folksy Omaha guy | Intensely competitive |
| Simple lifestyle | Obsessive about money |
| Happy marriage | Unconventional arrangement |
| Generous philanthropist | Accumulated for decades before giving |

### Susie and Astrid

| Relationship | Dynamic |
|--------------|---------|
| Susie (wife) | Married 1952; separated 1977; never divorced |
| Astrid (companion) | Moved in after Susie left; married after Susie's death (2006) |
| The arrangement | Susie approved; all three were close |

**Schroeder's insight:** Buffett is emotionally dependent but avoidant—brilliant at business, awkward at intimacy.

## The philosophy

### On investing

> "Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Circle of competence** | Only invest in what you understand |
| **Margin of safety** | Buy well below intrinsic value |
| **Economic moats** | Durable competitive advantages |
| **Long-term holding** | "Our favorite holding period is forever" |
| **Concentrated bets** | Few positions, high conviction |

### On life

> "The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken."

| Value | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Reputation | "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it" |
| Inner scorecard | Care about self-judgment, not others' opinions |
| Rational thinking | Avoid emotional decisions |
| Reading | 5-6 hours daily |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start early** | Compounding needs time |
| **Never stop** | Buffett still works at 93 |
| **Quality over cheapness** | Good businesses compound |
| **Temperament > intellect** | Emotional control matters most |
| **Concentrated positions** | If you're right, bet big |
| **Permanent capital** | Structure matters |

### The Berkshire returns

| Period | Berkshire CAGR | S&P 500 CAGR |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 1965-2023 | ~20% | ~10% |
| Cumulative | 4,384,748% | 31,223% |

**The gap:** 140x better than the market over 58 years.

## The critiques

| Criticism | Schroeder's view |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Hagiography | Book reveals flaws (emotional distance, contradictions) |
| Too long | Comprehensive by design |
| Buffett controlled narrative | He later regretted some revelations |

**The falling out:** Buffett distanced himself from Schroeder after publication—some truths were too personal.
