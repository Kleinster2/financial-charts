# More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite

**Author:** Sebastian Mallaby
**Published:** 2010
**Awards:** FT/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year finalist

The definitive history of the hedge fund industry, from Alfred Winslow Jones's invention in 1949 through the 2008 crisis. Mallaby's thesis: hedge funds aren't the villains of popular imagination—they're sophisticated risk managers whose innovations improved markets, even when individual funds spectacularly failed.

---

## Core thesis

> "Hedge funds have been among the most sophisticated actors in the financial system. Their incentive structure—performance fees and personal capital at risk—aligned managers with investors in ways traditional asset management never achieved."

Hedge funds pioneered:
- Long/short equity (Jones)
- Global macro (Soros)
- Quantitative strategies (Simons)
- Event-driven/activist (Icahn, Paulson)

## The pioneers

### Alfred Winslow Jones (1949)

| Innovation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Long/short structure | Hedged market risk |
| 20% performance fee | Aligned incentives |
| Manager co-investment | Skin in the game |
| Limited partnership | Legal structure adopted by industry |

**The insight:** You could make money from stock selection while being neutral to market direction.

### Key figures by era

| Era | Fund/Manager | Style | Key trade |
|-----|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **1960s** | A.W. Jones | Long/short equity | Market-neutral stock picking |
| **1970s** | Michael Steinhardt | Block trading | Information edge from order flow |
| **1980s** | Julian Robertson (Tiger) | Global equity | Long quality, short garbage |
| **1980s-90s** | George Soros (Quantum) | Global macro | Breaking the Bank of England |
| **1990s** | John Meriwether (LTCM) | Fixed income arb | Relative value (then blowup) |
| **1990s-00s** | Jim Simons (Renaissance) | Quantitative | Medallion's 66% annual returns |
| **2000s** | John Paulson | Event-driven | The greatest trade ever (housing) |

## The Soros chapter: Breaking the pound

September 1992 — Soros bet against sterling staying in the ERM:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Position size | $10B short sterling |
| Conviction | Reflexivity—the peg was unsustainable |
| Outcome | Made $1B in one day |
| Impact | Britain left ERM; Soros became famous |

**Mallaby's view:** This wasn't predatory—Soros identified a mispricing the market would eventually correct.

---

## The LTCM chapter: Hubris and disaster

| What went right | What went wrong |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Nobel laureates, PhDs | Leverage of 25:1 |
| Sophisticated models | Models assumed normal distributions |
| Years of strong returns | Russia default created correlation spike |
| **Result** | Lost $4.6B, Fed-brokered bailout |

**Lesson:** Brilliant doesn't mean infallible. Leverage kills.

## The Renaissance chapter: The black box

Jim Simons and the Medallion Fund:

| Metric | Medallion |
|--------|-----------|
| Annual returns (1988-2008) | ~66% before fees |
| After fees | ~39% (5/44 fee structure) |
| Sharpe ratio | ~2.0+ (extraordinary) |
| Transparency | Near zero |
| Edge | Signal processing, not financial theory |

**Key insight:** Simons hired mathematicians and physicists, not MBAs. They treated markets as data patterns, not economic stories.

---

## The Paulson chapter: The greatest trade ever

John Paulson's 2007 housing bet:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Thesis | Subprime was mispriced; housing would crash |
| Vehicle | Credit default swaps on subprime MBS |
| 2007 return | +590% |
| Dollar profit | ~$15B for the fund |

**Mallaby's observation:** Many saw the housing bubble. Paulson found the trade structure to profit massively from being right.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Incentive structures matter | 2/20 aligns managers; mutual funds don't |
| Leverage is the killer | Every blowup involves too much leverage |
| Edge erodes | Strategies get crowded; alpha decays |
| Diversification across styles | No single approach always works |
| Skin in the game | Manager co-investment is a positive signal |

### Hedge fund evolution

| Era | Dominant style | Edge source |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1950s-70s | Stock picking | Fundamental research |
| 1980s-90s | Global macro | Macro analysis + sizing |
| 1990s-00s | Quant | Computing power + data |
| 2010s-20s | Multi-strat | Diversification + risk management |

## The defense of hedge funds

Mallaby argues hedge funds:

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Improve price discovery | Shorts identify overvaluation |
| Provide liquidity | Step in during crises |
| Take risk others won't | Bear concentrated positions |
| Align incentives | Performance fees + co-investment |

**The nuance:** Individual funds blow up, but the industry improves market function.
