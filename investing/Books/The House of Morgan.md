# The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance

**Author:** Ron Chernow
**Published:** 1990
**Awards:** National Book Award for Nonfiction
**Length:** 800+ pages

The definitive history of the Morgan banking dynasty across four generations and 150 years—from J. Pierpont Morgan's rescue of the US economy in 1907 to the Glass-Steagall breakup and beyond. Chernow's thesis: the House of Morgan shaped American capitalism, and understanding the Morgans is understanding modern finance.

## Core thesis

> "The Morgans were the most powerful bankers in American history, and their story is inseparable from the story of American capitalism itself."

The Morgan influence:
- Financed the industrial revolution (railroads, steel, electricity)
- Created the modern corporation (US Steel, GE, AT&T)
- Served as de facto central bank (before the Fed existed)
- Defined the relationship between Wall Street and Washington

## The three ages

### The Baronial Age (1838-1913)

| Era | Character | Role |
|-----|-----------|------|
| Junius Morgan | Founder | London-based; financed US from abroad |
| **J. Pierpont Morgan** | Titan | "Jupiter"; dominated American finance |

**J.P. Morgan's power:**
- Rescued the US Treasury (1895) by organizing gold shipments
- Stopped the Panic of 1907 single-handedly
- Created US Steel ($1.4B—first billion-dollar corporation)
- Reorganized railroads, utilities, industrial companies
- Collected art; built institutions (Metropolitan Museum)

**The 1907 Panic:** Morgan locked bankers in his library until they agreed to a rescue plan. There was no Fed—Morgan *was* the lender of last resort.

### The Diplomatic Age (1913-1948)

| Era | Character | Role |
|-----|-----------|------|
| J.P. Morgan Jr. ("Jack") | Heir | Anglo-American finance; WWI loans |
| Thomas Lamont | Partner | Diplomat-banker; League of Nations |

**Key developments:**
- Federal Reserve created (1913)—reduced Morgan's central role
- WWI financing: Morgan became agent for British/French war loans
- 1929 crash: Morgan tried (and failed) to stabilize markets
- Glass-Steagall (1933): Forced split between commercial and investment banking
- Morgan chose commercial banking → Morgan Stanley spun off

### The Casino Age (1948-1990)

| Era | Firms | Character |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Post-split | Morgan Guaranty (commercial) | Conservative, wholesale |
| Post-split | Morgan Stanley (investment) | Aggressive, deal-making |

**The transformation:**
- Morgan Guaranty: Staid, relationship-based, declining relevance
- Morgan Stanley: Rose to prominence in M&A, trading
- Glass-Steagall erosion: Lines blurred; eventually repealed (1999)
- J.P. Morgan merger with Chase (2000): Created JPMorgan Chase

## The decline

| Glass-Steagall (1933) | Broke up universal banking |
| Rise of capital markets | Disintermediation—companies issued directly |
| Competition | Other banks caught up |
| Meritocracy | WASP exclusivity became liability |
| Regulation | Government oversight limited discretion |

## Investment relevance
