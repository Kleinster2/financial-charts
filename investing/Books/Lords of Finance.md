# Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World

**Author:** Liaquat Ahamed
**Published:** 2009
**Awards:** Pulitzer Prize for History (2010)

The definitive account of how four central bankers—through rigid adherence to the gold standard and catastrophic policy errors—turned a recession into the Great Depression. Ahamed's thesis: the Depression wasn't inevitable; it was man-made, the product of decisions by a small group of powerful men who misunderstood the monetary system they controlled.

## Core thesis

> "The Great Depression was not some act of God or the result of some deep-rooted contradictions of capitalism but the direct result of a series of misjudgments by economic policymakers."

The four central bankers—each brilliant, each convinced of his rectitude—collectively engineered the worst economic catastrophe in modern history.

## The four protagonists

| Banker | Institution | Fatal flaw |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Montagu Norman** | Bank of England | Obsessed with restoring British prestige; returned to gold at overvalued rate |
| **Benjamin Strong** | NY Federal Reserve | The one who understood; died too soon (1928) |
| **Émile Moreau** | Banque de France | Hoarded gold; weaponized monetary policy |
| **Hjalmar Schacht** | Reichsbank | Managed reparations; later enabled Nazi rearmament |

**The tragedy:** Strong was the only one who grasped that the gold standard required international cooperation. His death in 1928 removed the one voice of reason.

## The gold standard trap

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Fixed exchange rates | No monetary flexibility |
| Gold flows dictated policy | Deflation when gold left |
| Beggar-thy-neighbor | Countries hoarded gold competitively |
| Credibility obsession | Prevented necessary devaluation |

**The vicious cycle:**
1. Economic weakness → gold outflows
2. Gold outflows → forced to raise rates
3. Higher rates → deeper contraction
4. Deeper contraction → more gold outflows

**Britain's original sin:** Returning to gold in 1925 at the pre-war parity ($4.86/£) when the economy warranted $4.40. Churchill, as Chancellor, later called it "the greatest mistake of my life."

## Key episodes

### 1. The 1927 secret meeting

Strong invited Norman, Moreau, and Schacht to New York. They agreed to lower US rates to ease pressure on sterling. It worked temporarily but fueled the stock bubble.

### 2. Strong's death (1928)

Benjamin Strong died of tuberculosis. The Fed's leadership fragmented. No one with his stature remained to coordinate international policy.

### 3. The crash and response (1929-31)

| What should have happened | What did happen |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Monetary expansion | Contraction |
| Lender of last resort | Bank failures |
| Fiscal stimulus | Austerity |
| International cooperation | Competitive devaluation |

### 4. Britain leaves gold (1931)

When Britain finally abandoned gold in September 1931, the world didn't end. Sterling fell 30%, exports recovered, the economy improved. The "unthinkable" turned out to be the cure.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Central bankers can be catastrophically wrong | Don't assume policy competence |
| Ideology can override evidence | Gold bugs, inflation hawks repeat the pattern |
| International coordination is fragile | Watch for beggar-thy-neighbor dynamics |
| The "unthinkable" option often works | Currency devaluation, QE, deficit spending |
| Credibility obsession is dangerous | ECB austerity in 2010s echoed 1930s errors |

## Modern parallels

| 1930s | 2010s |
|-------|-------|
| Gold standard rigidity | Euro straitjacket |
| Deflation spiral | Eurozone deflation |
| Austerity as cure | Greek austerity |
| Delayed devaluation | No devaluation option for Greece |
| US finally reflated (1933) | US QE worked; Europe lagged |
