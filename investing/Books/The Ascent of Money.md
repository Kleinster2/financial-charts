# The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World

**Author:** Niall Ferguson
**Published:** 2008
**Adapted:** PBS/Channel 4 documentary series

Ferguson's sweeping history of finance from ancient Mesopotamia to the 2008 crisis. His thesis: financial innovation has been as important to human progress as scientific or technological innovation—money, bonds, stocks, insurance, and real estate are technologies that enabled the modern world.

## Core thesis

> "Money is not metal. It is trust inscribed. And it does not seem to matter much where it is inscribed: on silver, on clay, on paper, on a liquid crystal display."

Finance as technology:
- Each innovation (banking, bonds, insurance, stocks) solved a problem
- Innovations enabled new forms of organization and risk-taking
- Financial crises are the price of financial innovation
- Understanding financial history is essential to understanding history

## The six innovations

### 1. Money and banking (Chapters 1-2)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Money** | Store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account |
| **Credit** | Mesopotamian clay tablets; lending enables investment |
| **Banking** | Medici invented modern banking; concentrated capital |
| **Central banking** | Bank of England (1694); lender of last resort |

**Key insight:** Money is a relationship—a claim on future resources. The Medici understood that controlling credit meant controlling power.

### 2. Bonds (Chapter 3)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Government bonds** | Italian city-states funded wars with debt |
| **Bond markets** | Dutch Republic created liquid sovereign debt |
| **Rothschilds** | Internationalized bond trading; funded nations |

**Key insight:** The bond market is the most powerful force in economics. Governments that can't borrow cheaply can't function.

### 3. Stocks (Chapter 4)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Joint-stock company** | Dutch East India Company (1602); pooled capital |
| **Limited liability** | Enabled risk-taking without personal ruin |
| **Stock exchanges** | Amsterdam, London, NYSE; liquid ownership |

**Key insight:** Equity allows risk to be shared and enterprises to outlive founders. The corporation is a revolutionary technology.

### 4. Insurance (Chapter 5)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Marine insurance** | Lloyd's of London; enabled trade |
| **Life insurance** | Scottish clergy invented actuarial math |
| **Welfare state** | Risk-pooling at national scale |

**Key insight:** Insurance is humanity's answer to the future's uncertainty. Without it, risk-taking is suicidal.

### 5. Real estate (Chapter 6)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Property rights** | Collateral enables borrowing |
| **Mortgages** | Transformed housing from expense to investment |
| **Securitization** | Spread risk (and, eventually, created new risks) |

**Key insight:** Property ownership creates wealth and political stake. The mortgage democratized wealth-building—and its abuse caused crises.

### 6. Globalization and empire (interwoven)

| Theme | Ferguson's view |
|-------|-----------------|
| Finance followed empire | British capital built global infrastructure |
| Finance enabled empire | Rothschilds funded wars and railroads |
| Globalization isn't new | 19th century was highly integrated |
| It can reverse | WWI ended first globalization |

---

## The crises

Ferguson shows financial innovation produces crises:

| Crisis | Innovation that enabled it |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Mississippi Bubble (1720) | Paper money, stock speculation |
| South Sea Bubble (1720) | Joint-stock mania |
| Panics of 1800s | Banking without regulation |
| 1929 | Margin lending, speculation |
| 2008 | Securitization, CDOs, leverage |

**His view:** Crises are the cost of progress. The alternative—no financial innovation—would be worse.

---

## The 2008 crisis

Ferguson wrote as the crisis unfolded:

| Element | Historical parallel |
|---------|-------------------|
| Housing bubble | Mississippi, South Sea |
| Leverage | Every major crisis |
| Contagion | 1907, 1929, 1997 |
| Bailouts | Lender of last resort (1694+) |

**His prediction:** History suggests recovery, but the timeline depends on policy response.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Financial innovation is powerful** | New instruments create opportunity and risk |
| **Crises recur** | Don't assume "this time is different" |
| **Institutions matter** | Rule of law, property rights enable finance |
| **Global finance isn't new** | 1870-1914 was also highly integrated |
| **Reversals happen** | WWI ended first globalization; could happen again |

### The hierarchy of financial returns

Ferguson suggests historical ordering:

| Asset class | Long-term real return |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Equities | Highest |
| Real estate | High |
| Bonds | Moderate |
| Cash | Low/negative (inflation) |

---

## Ferguson's perspective

| View | Controversy |
|------|-------------|
| Empire had benefits | Critics call this apologia |
| Markets mostly work | More optimistic than critics |
| Crises are inevitable | Not an argument for passivity |
| West's rise was financial | Not just military or industrial |
