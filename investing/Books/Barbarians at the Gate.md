# Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco

**Authors:** Bryan Burrough and John Helyar
**Published:** 1989
**Based on:** Wall Street Journal reporting
**Adapted:** HBO film (1993)

The definitive account of the largest leveraged buyout in history (at the time). The $31 billion battle for RJR Nabisco became a symbol of 1980s excess—corporate raiders, junk bonds, and management greed colliding in a spectacle that reshaped American capitalism.

## The deal

## The title's origin

Ted Forstmann, disgusted by KKR's use of junk bonds, declared:

> "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

He called Kravis's money "phoney junk bond crap" and positioned himself as using "real money." The authors adopted his framing.

## Key themes

### Corporate excess

Johnson epitomized a new CEO type:
- Corporate jets ("RJR Air Force")
- Celebrity friends (athletes, entertainers)
- Lavish perks for executives
- Focus on deal-making over operations

### The LBO machine

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Junk bonds (Drexel/Milken) | Enabled massive debt financing |
| Commercial banks | Provided senior debt |
| Management equity | Aligned incentives |
| Asset sales | Paid down debt post-deal |

### Greed as driver

> "From the title, we understand that the authors feel greed is the overriding force... not about products, technology, or services, but rather about money itself."

## Why it matters

### For private equity

RJR Nabisco established the template for mega-LBOs:
- Management can be bidder or target
- Strategic buyers compete with financial buyers
- Junk bonds enable scale previously impossible
- Public companies are acquirable

### For corporate governance

The deal sparked debate about:
- CEO compensation and perks
- Board fiduciary duties
- Shareholder vs stakeholder interests
- Debt-fueled financial engineering

## Investment lessons

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Scale attracts competition | Mega-deals invite rival bidders |
| Management conflicts | Buyers aligned with management face governance risk |
| Debt is a tool and a risk | LBO returns depend on deleveraging |
| Timing matters | 1980s debt markets enabled deals impossible before/after |
