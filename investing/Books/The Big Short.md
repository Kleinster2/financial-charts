# The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine

**Author:** Michael Lewis
**Published:** 2010
**Adapted:** 2015 film (Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay)

Lewis tells the 2008 crisis through the eyes of the contrarians who saw it coming and bet against the housing market. The book exposes how subprime mortgages were bundled into toxic securities, blessed by clueless rating agencies, and sold to investors who didn't understand the risks—while a handful of outsiders made fortunes betting on collapse.

## The protagonists

| Investor | Background | The trade |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Michael Burry** | Hedge fund manager, former neurology resident, glass eye | First to buy credit default swaps on subprime MBS; made $700M+ |
| **Steve Eisman** | Brash fund manager at FrontPoint Partners | Called out Wall Street stupidity directly; massive short position |
| **Jamie Mai & Charlie Ledley** | Two guys in a garage (Cornwall Capital) | Turned $110K into millions via mispriced options |
| **Greg Lippmann** | Deutsche Bank trader | Sold CDS to shorts while his own bank held toxic assets |

**Common thread:** Outsiders, often socially awkward, who bothered to read the loan-level data when no one else did.

## The machine

### How it worked

```
Subprime loans → bundled into MBS → sliced into CDOs → rated AAA → sold to investors
```

| Layer | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Lenders** | Gave mortgages to anyone; paid on volume, not quality |
| **Banks** | Packaged loans and passed risk along |
| **Rating agencies** | Gave AAA ratings to garbage; paid by issuers |
| **Investors** | Trusted ratings; didn't read prospectuses |
| **Regulators** | Asleep |

### Why no one noticed

- Complexity obscured risk
- Everyone was making money
- "Housing prices always go up"
- Incentives aligned toward denial

## The trade

**Credit default swaps (CDS):** Insurance against bond default. Pay a small premium; receive huge payout if bonds fail.

**Why it was mispriced:** Banks thought subprime bonds were safe. CDS premiums were cheap. The shorts paid pennies for dollars of protection.

**The catch:** Had to wait. Burry faced investor revolt as his fund bled premiums for two years before the collapse.

## Key scenes

| Scene | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| Eisman at CDO conference | Discovers bankers don't understand their own products |
| Vegas securitization conference (2007) | Shorts realize the entire industry is delusional |
| Burry reads loan tapes | Finds loans with no documentation, negative amortization |
| Cornwall discovers CDO² | CDOs of CDOs—leverage on leverage |

## Investment lessons

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Read the documents | Most people don't; edge exists in due diligence |
| Mispricing persists | Markets can be wrong for years |
| Incentives matter | Follow the money; who gets paid for what? |
| Outsiders see clearly | Industry insiders have blind spots |
| Conviction requires pain | Being early feels like being wrong |

## The aftermath

The shorts made billions. The banks that created the mess were bailed out. Few went to jail. Lewis's implicit thesis: the system that created 2008 was never truly fixed.
