# When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management

**Author:** Roger Lowenstein
**Published:** 2000
**Recognition:** BusinessWeek Best Book of the Year

The definitive account of Long-Term Capital Management's collapse in 1998. Lowenstein's thesis: even Nobel laureates with brilliant models can blow up when they ignore tail risk and human behavior. LTCM's implosion wasn't a one-off—it was a template for every subsequent quant crisis, from 2007's quant meltdown to 2008's broader crash.

## The cast

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| **John Meriwether** | Founder, legendary Salomon bond trader |
| **Myron Scholes** | Nobel laureate, Black-Scholes model |
| **Robert Merton** | Nobel laureate, options theory |
| **David Mullins** | Former Fed Vice Chair |
| **Eric Rosenfeld** | Head of risk |

The fund was designed to be the smartest room on Wall Street.

## The rise

| Year | Performance |
|------|-------------|
| 1994 | +28% (first partial year) |
| 1995 | +59% ($1.6B profit) |
| 1996 | +57% |
| 1997 | +25% |

LTCM became the darling of Wall Street. Banks competed to lend. At peak, the fund commanded **$100+ billion in assets**.

**The strategy:** Convergence trades—betting that similar securities would converge in price. Bond arbitrage, volatility arbitrage, merger arbitrage. Small edges, massive leverage.

## The leverage problem

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Assets | $100B+ |
| Equity | ~$4B |
| Leverage ratio | **25:1 to 28:1** |
| Notional derivatives exposure | $1+ trillion |

LTCM kept banks in the dark about total leverage. Each bank saw only its own exposure, not the aggregate picture.

## The collapse

**August 1998:** Russia defaults on domestic debt. Global flight to quality.

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Aug 17, 1998 | Russia defaults |
| Aug 21, 1998 | LTCM loses $553M in one day |
| Late Aug | Losses accelerate |
| Sep 23, 1998 | Fed-organized bailout |

**The model failure:** LTCM's models calculated maximum daily loss at $35 million. They lost **$553 million in a single day**—an event the models said shouldn't happen once in the lifetime of the universe.

> "Theoretically, the odds against a loss such as August 1998's had been prohibitive... an event so freakish as to be unlikely to occur even once over the entire life of the universe. But it still happened."

## The bailout

The [[Federal Reserve]] Bank of New York organized a private-sector rescue:

| Participant | Contribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| 14 major banks | $3.6B total |
| Fed role | Convener, not lender |
| Outcome | Orderly unwind over 2 years |

The Fed intervened not out of sympathy but fear: LTCM's thousands of derivative contracts were counterparty to nearly every major bank. Disorderly collapse risked systemic contagion.

## Key lessons

### 1. Models miss tail risk

Gaussian distributions underestimate extreme events. "Six sigma" events happen far more often than models predict.

### 2. Leverage kills

Small edges become existential risks at high leverage. No margin of safety.

### 3. Correlation spikes in crisis

Assets that seem uncorrelated become correlated when everyone runs for the exits simultaneously. Diversification fails when you need it most.

### 4. Genius is not immunity

Nobel Prizes don't prevent blowups. Intellectual confidence can become hubris.

### 5. Counterparty concentration matters

When one fund is counterparty to everyone, its failure threatens everyone.

---

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Tail risk is real | Fat tails, not normal distributions |
| Leverage limits matter | Position sizing > edge |
| Crowded trades unwind violently | Watch positioning data |
| Models are maps, not territory | Stress test assumptions |
| "Never happened before" isn't zero probability | Black swans exist |

---

## Legacy

LTCM became shorthand for quant hubris. Every subsequent crisis echoes it:
- 2007 quant meltdown
- 2008 AIG (same counterparty concentration)
- 2021 Archegos (same leverage opacity)

Lowenstein's afterword notes LTCM "should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability."
