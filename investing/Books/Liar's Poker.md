# Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street

**Author:** Michael Lewis
**Published:** 1989
**Context:** Semi-autobiographical account of Lewis's years at Salomon Brothers (1985-1988)

The book that defined 1980s Wall Street excess. Lewis chronicles his unlikely journey from Princeton art history major to bond salesman, exposing the culture of greed, machismo, and creative destruction that birthed the mortgage bond market—and planted seeds for 2008.

## The author's path

Lewis stumbled into finance through luck, not ambition:

| Step | What happened |
|------|---------------|
| Princeton | Art history major, no finance background |
| LSE | Economics degree |
| The break | Seated next to Salomon partner's wife at Queen Mother's banquet |
| Interview | Got job through connection, not merit |
| Training | Survived brutal "training program" hazing |
| Career | Rose to million-dollar producer in 3 years |

**The irony:** Lewis wrote the book as a cautionary tale; readers treated it as a how-to manual.

## Key figures

| Person | Role | Significance |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **John Gutfreund** | Salomon CEO | "King of Wall Street"; challenged subordinates to liar's poker for $1 million |
| **Lewis Ranieri** | Head of mortgage trading | Invented mortgage-backed securities; made Salomon rich |
| **John Meriwether** | Arbitrage head | Later founded [[LTCM]]; appears in [[When Genius Failed]] |

## The mortgage bond revolution

Salomon Brothers essentially created the mortgage-backed securities market:

| Innovation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Securitization | Bundled mortgages into tradeable bonds |
| Tranching | Sliced risk into different layers |
| Secondary market | Made mortgages liquid |
| Volume | Mortgage trading dwarfed other bonds by late 1980s |

**The shift that enabled it:** Volcker's 1979 decision to target money supply instead of interest rates → rates fluctuated wildly → bond prices moved → trading became profitable.

## The culture

### The game

"Liar's poker" was a gambling game played with serial numbers on dollar bills—bidding on how many of a digit appeared across all bills in play. It became a test of nerve and bluffing, symbolizing trading floor culture.

### The ethos

> "It was wonderful to be young and working on Wall Street in the 1980s: never before had so many twenty-four-year-olds made so much money in so little time."

| Trait | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Machismo | Screaming, intimidation, hazing |
| Greed | Bonus obsession, client exploitation |
| Cynicism | "Big swinging dick" as highest compliment |
| Anti-intellectualism | Traders mocked "geeks" and quants |

## Why it matters for 2008

*Liar's Poker* is the prequel to [[The Big Short]]:

| 1980s (Liar's Poker) | 2000s (Big Short) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Mortgage bonds invented | Mortgage bonds weaponized |
| Risk passed to investors | Risk hidden in CDOs |
| Salomon prints money | Everyone prints money |
| Regulators unaware | Regulators captured |

Lewis explicitly connects the two in *The Big Short*'s introduction: the culture and instruments he witnessed being born enabled the 2008 disaster.

## Investment lessons

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Innovation can be predatory | New products often exploit information asymmetry |
| Culture shapes risk-taking | Incentives + machismo = recklessness |
| Clients are counterparties | Wall Street serves itself first |
| Success can be random | Lewis's career was luck, not skill |
