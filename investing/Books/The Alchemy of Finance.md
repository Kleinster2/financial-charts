# The Alchemy of Finance

**Author:** George Soros
**Published:** 1987
**Updated:** 2003 (with new preface and commentary)

Soros's philosophical treatise on markets, introducing his theory of **reflexivity**—the idea that market participants' biased perceptions don't just reflect reality but actively shape it. The book combines abstract theory with a real-time trading diary from 1985-86, showing Soros's thought process during a period when he made over 100% returns.

## Core thesis: Reflexivity

> "Market prices are always wrong in the sense that they present a biased view of the future."

**Classical view:** Markets reflect fundamentals → prices discover truth
**Soros's view:** Perceptions affect fundamentals → prices create reality

### The feedback loop

```
Perceptions → Decisions → Reality → Perceptions (changed)
     ↑                                    ↓
     └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Markets aren't equilibrium-seeking mechanisms. They're reflexive systems where beliefs become self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies.

## Key concepts

### 1. Fallibility

Participants can never have complete knowledge. Their understanding is always partial, biased, flawed.

### 2. Reflexivity

| In natural science | In social science |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Observer separate from observed | Observer affects observed |
| Objective truth possible | Thinking participants distort reality |
| Equilibrium tends to restore | Disequilibrium can persist and amplify |

### 3. Boom-bust sequences

Reflexivity creates self-reinforcing cycles:

| Phase | Dynamic |
|-------|---------|
| **Inception** | Trend + bias emerge |
| **Acceleration** | Trend reinforces bias |
| **Testing** | Trend survives challenges |
| **Twilight** | Bias fully recognized but trend continues |
| **Reversal** | Trend reverses, bias collapses |
| **Crisis** | Self-reinforcing decline |

## The real-time experiment

The book includes Soros's trading diary from August 1985 to November 1986:

| Period | Key trades | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Aug 1985 | Long DM, Yen; Short $ | Plaza Accord vindicated |
| Late 1985 | Long US bonds, stocks | Bull market rode |
| 1986 | Long oil, short $ | Oil collapse hurt, recovered |
| **Total** | ~$1B → ~$2B | ~100% return |

**The value:** Seeing a master think in real-time—wrong sometimes, but showing how he adjusted.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Markets aren't efficient | Mispricings can persist and grow |
| Narratives move prices | Stories create feedback loops |
| Don't fight reflexive trends | Ride them, but know they'll reverse |
| Test your thesis constantly | Be ready to reverse |
| Uncertainty is the baseline | You're always working with imperfect info |

### When reflexivity matters most

| Condition | Reflexivity strength |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Credit expansion | Very high — lending creates collateral |
| Currency crises | Very high — confidence is self-fulfilling |
| Bubbles | Very high — prices validate narratives |
| Stable commodities | Lower — physical constraints bind |

---

## Criticisms

| Critique | Soros's response |
|----------|-----------------|
| Not falsifiable | Admits it's not science; it's a framework |
| Too vague | Specificity would make it tradeable by all |
| Just momentum dressed up | Reflexivity explains why momentum works |

## The Soros method

1. **Form a thesis** about how bias will affect reality
2. **Test it with a position** — find out if you're right
3. **Let winners run** — reflexive trends persist longer than expected
4. **Cut losers fast** — being wrong is information
5. **Reverse when wrong** — no ego attachment to positions

> "It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong."
