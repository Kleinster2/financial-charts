# The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing

**Author:** Benjamin Graham
**First Published:** 1949
**Current Edition:** Revised with commentary by Jason Zweig
**Endorsement:** Warren Buffett calls it "by far the best book on investing ever written"

The bible of value investing. Graham—the "father of value investing"—teaches that intelligent investing is not about IQ but discipline: buying undervalued securities with a margin of safety, ignoring market noise, and controlling your emotions. This book shaped Buffett, who read it at age 20 and built his career on its principles.

## Core thesis

**Value investing defined:**

> "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."

The intelligent investor:
- Analyzes thoroughly before buying
- Seeks margin of safety
- Thinks long-term
- Ignores market sentiment
- Controls emotions

## Three pillars

### 1. Margin of safety

> "The function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future."

Buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value. This cushion protects against:
- Analytical errors
- Unforeseen problems
- Bad luck

### 2. Mr. Market

Graham's famous allegory: imagine the market as a manic-depressive partner who daily offers to buy your shares or sell you his—at wildly varying prices.

| Mr. Market's mood | Your response |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Euphoric (high prices) | Consider selling |
| Depressed (low prices) | Consider buying |
| Neutral | Do nothing |

**The key insight:** Mr. Market is there to serve you, not guide you. His prices are offers, not valuations.

### 3. Investment vs speculation

| Investing | Speculating |
|-----------|-------------|
| Based on analysis | Based on prediction |
| Seeks safety of principal | Accepts risk of loss |
| Expects adequate return | Hopes for outsized gain |
| Long-term horizon | Short-term focus |

---

## Two types of investors

| Type | Approach | Time required |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Defensive** | Minimize effort and risk; buy diversified, high-quality stocks/bonds | Minimal |
| **Enterprising** | Active selection; seek undervalued securities | Significant |

Graham cautions: most people should be defensive investors. The enterprising path requires real work and emotional discipline.

## Key principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Price ≠ Value | Market price fluctuates; intrinsic value is more stable |
| Don't follow the crowd | Popularity often means overvaluation |
| Diversify | Don't put all eggs in one basket |
| Know yourself | Understand your risk tolerance and biases |
| Be patient | Good opportunities are rare; wait for them |

## The Buffett connection

Warren Buffett:
- Read *The Intelligent Investor* at age 20
- Studied under Graham at Columbia Business School
- Worked at Graham-Newman Corporation
- Calls Graham "the second most influential person in my life after my own father"

Buffett later evolved beyond pure Graham (adding qualitative factors), but the margin of safety concept remains central.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Margin of safety is paramount | Better to miss opportunities than lose capital |
| Ignore market noise | Daily prices are distractions |
| Temperament > IQ | Emotional discipline matters most |
| Do your homework | Never buy what you don't understand |
| Patience pays | Wait for the fat pitch |
