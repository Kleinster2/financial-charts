# Security Analysis

**Authors:** Benjamin Graham and David Dodd
**First Published:** 1934
**Current Edition:** 6th (2008)
**Sold:** Over 1 million copies across editions

The original value investing textbook. More technical than [[The Intelligent Investor]], *Security Analysis* provides the analytical framework for evaluating stocks and bonds based on fundamentals. Graham and Dodd's core insight—that securities have an intrinsic value separate from market price, and that careful analysis can identify discrepancies—launched a discipline.

## Core concepts

### Intrinsic value vs market price

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Intrinsic value** | True worth based on fundamentals (assets, earnings, dividends, prospects) |
| **Market price** | Current price determined by supply/demand, sentiment |
| **The opportunity** | When market price significantly differs from intrinsic value |

> "The essential function of security analysis is identifying substantial discrepancies between market valuation and prudent assessment of intrinsic value."

### Margin of safety

Graham and Dodd coined the term:

> Buy only when the market price is significantly below intrinsic value. The gap provides protection against errors, bad luck, and unforeseen problems.

## Analytical framework

### What to analyze

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Earnings** | EPS, earnings stability, growth trends |
| **Balance sheet** | Book value, working capital, debt levels |
| **Dividends** | Yield, payout ratio, consistency |
| **Valuation** | P/E, price-to-book, dividend yield |
| **Quality** | Competitive position, management, industry |

### The Graham approach

1. Start with quantitative screens (low P/E, below book value)
2. Dig into financials for quality
3. Estimate conservative intrinsic value
4. Require substantial margin of safety
5. Diversify across multiple positions

## Key principles

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Investment ≠ speculation** | Invest on analysis; speculate on prediction |
| **Stocks are businesses** | Buy ownership, not lottery tickets |
| **Price matters** | A great company at a bad price is a bad investment |
| **Be conservative** | Assume the worst; require margin of safety |
| **Think long-term** | Short-term prices are noise |

## Historical context

Published in 1934—depths of the Depression—the book was a response to the 1929 crash and the speculative excess that preceded it. Graham and Dodd sought to establish investing as a disciplined, analytical practice distinct from gambling.
