# Irrational Exuberance

**Author:** Robert J. Shiller
**First Published:** March 2000 (2nd ed. 2005, 3rd ed. 2015)
**Awards:** Commonfund Prize; Shiller won 2013 Nobel Prize partly for this work

Shiller's thesis: asset bubbles are driven by psychology, not fundamentals. Markets are not efficient—they're subject to narratives, herding, and feedback loops. Published at the exact peak of the dot-com bubble (March 2000), the book's predictive success made it legendary. The 2005 edition correctly identified the housing bubble before it burst.

## Central thesis

**Psychologically driven volatility is inherent to all asset markets.**

> "Speculative bubbles [are] an unsustainable increase in prices brought on by investors' buying behavior rather than by genuine, fundamental information about value."

Markets are not rational calculating machines. They're social phenomena driven by narratives and emotions.

## The CAPE ratio

Shiller developed the **Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE)** ratio—price divided by 10-year average real earnings. This smooths cyclical fluctuations and reveals long-term valuation.

| CAPE level | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| <15 | Historically cheap |
| 15-25 | Fair value range |
| >25 | Expensive, lower future returns |
| >30 | Bubble territory |

CAPE was ~44 in March 2000. It had never been higher.

## Predictive success

| Edition | Prediction | Outcome |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 1st (Mar 2000) | Stock market overvalued | Nasdaq peaked same month, fell 80%+ |
| 2nd (2005) | Housing bubble | Housing peaked 2006, crashed 2007-08 |
| 3rd (2015) | Bond market frothy | Low rates persisted but reversed 2022 |

The timing of the first edition—published at the exact dot-com peak—was either extraordinary luck or vindication of the methodology.

## Bubble anatomy

Shiller identifies three categories of bubble drivers:

### Structural factors
- Precipitating events (Internet, deregulation)
- Amplification mechanisms ("naturally occurring Ponzi processes")
- Feedback loops (rising prices → more buying → rising prices)

### Cultural factors
- Media amplification
- "New era" thinking ("this time is different")
- Investment culture spread

### Psychological factors
- Anchoring (arbitrary reference points)
- Herding (following others)
- Overconfidence
- Availability bias (recent events overweighted)

## Key arguments

### 1. Efficient markets are wrong

The efficient market hypothesis assumes prices reflect all information. Shiller's evidence: prices are far more volatile than dividends or earnings justify. The excess volatility is psychological.

### 2. Narratives drive markets

Stories matter more than spreadsheets. "New economy" narratives, housing-always-goes-up beliefs—these shared stories coordinate behavior.

### 3. Feedback loops are dangerous

Price increases attract buyers, which raises prices, which attracts more buyers. This is a Ponzi structure that requires ever-new entrants.

### 4. Policy should respond

Shiller argues regulators should consider asset prices, not just goods inflation. Letting bubbles inflate invites crashes.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| CAPE predicts long-term returns | High CAPE → lower 10-year returns |
| Narratives signal bubbles | "This time is different" = warning |
| Psychology > fundamentals (short-term) | Sentiment indicators matter |
| Mean reversion is slow | Bubbles can persist for years |
| Don't fight the narrative | But don't believe it either |

## The Shiller method

Shiller's approach combines:
1. **Long historical data** — 100+ year price/earnings series
2. **Behavioral economics** — psychology of investors
3. **Survey data** — asking investors what they believe
4. **Narrative analysis** — tracking stories in media

This multidisciplinary approach challenged finance orthodoxy.
