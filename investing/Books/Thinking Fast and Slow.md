# Thinking, Fast and Slow

**Author:** Daniel Kahneman
**Published:** 2011
**Recognition:** Kahneman won 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics (with Vernon Smith) for prospect theory

The definitive synthesis of decades of research on human judgment and decision-making. Kahneman's central framework: the mind operates via two systems—fast, intuitive System 1 and slow, deliberate System 2. Most errors in judgment come from System 1's biases operating unchecked.

## Core framework: Two systems

| System 1 | System 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Fast, automatic | Slow, effortful |
| Intuitive | Analytical |
| Always on | Lazy, easily depleted |
| Pattern-matching | Rule-following |
| Emotional | Logical |
| Makes most decisions | Thinks it makes most decisions |

**The key insight:** System 2 thinks it's in charge, but System 1 runs the show. Most of our judgments are intuitive, and System 2 often just rationalizes what System 1 already decided.

## Major biases and heuristics

### Availability heuristic

We judge probability by how easily examples come to mind.

| What's easy to recall | What we overestimate |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Plane crashes | Flying risk |
| Shark attacks | Shark danger |
| Recent market crash | Crash probability |

### Anchoring

Initial numbers bias subsequent estimates, even when irrelevant.

| Anchor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Is the Mississippi longer or shorter than 500 miles?" | Lower estimates |
| "Is the Mississippi longer or shorter than 5,000 miles?" | Higher estimates |
| First price in negotiation | Sets the range |

### Loss aversion

Losses hurt ~2x more than equivalent gains feel good.

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| $100 loss = $200 gain in emotional impact | Explains risk aversion for gains |
| People gamble to avoid sure losses | Explains risk-seeking when losing |
| Endowment effect | Selling price > buying price for same item |

### Overconfidence

We're systematically overconfident about our predictions.

| Calibration finding | Reality |
|--------------------|---------|
| "90% confident" forecasts | Right ~70% of time |
| "99% confident" forecasts | Right ~85% of time |
| Experts aren't better calibrated | Sometimes worse |

## Prospect theory

Kahneman and Tversky's Nobel-winning alternative to expected utility:

### Key features

| Classical economics | Prospect theory |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Absolute wealth matters | Changes from reference point matter |
| Linear value of money | Diminishing sensitivity |
| Risk aversion | Loss aversion (2x weight on losses) |
| Rational probability weighting | Overweight rare events, underweight likely ones |

### The fourfold pattern

| | Gains | Losses |
|-|-------|--------|
| **High probability** | Risk averse (take sure gain) | Risk seeking (gamble to avoid loss) |
| **Low probability** | Risk seeking (lottery tickets) | Risk averse (insurance) |

## What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI)

System 1 constructs the best story from available information—and doesn't know what it doesn't know.

| Consequence | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Jumping to conclusions | Making decisions with partial info |
| Coherence over completeness | A good story beats missing data |
| Overconfidence | We don't see our blind spots |

---

## Investment relevance

| Bias | Market implication |
|------|-------------------|
| **Overconfidence** | Excessive trading destroys returns |
| **Loss aversion** | Holding losers too long, selling winners too early |
| **Anchoring** | Price targets anchored to irrelevant levels |
| **Availability** | Recent events overweighted in forecasts |
| **WYSIATI** | Narratives trump incomplete data |
| **Hindsight bias** | "I knew it all along" after the fact |

### Kahneman's advice for investors

1. **Recognize your limitations** — you're not as good at forecasting as you think
2. **Use rules** — System 2 rules constrain System 1 impulses
3. **Outside view** — reference class forecasting beats inside view
4. **Pre-mortems** — imagine failure before it happens
5. **Checklists** — prevent overlooking known issues

---

## The planning fallacy

We systematically underestimate costs, time, and risks while overestimating benefits.

| Project type | Typical overrun |
|--------------|-----------------|
| IT projects | 50-100% |
| Construction | 30-50% |
| M&A synergies | Often never materialize |

**Solution:** Reference class forecasting—look at similar past projects, not your optimistic inside view.

---

## Replication concerns

Some findings from the broader "priming" literature Kahneman cites haven't replicated well. Core prospect theory and major biases remain robust.

| Status | Category |
|--------|----------|
| Robust | Prospect theory, loss aversion, anchoring, availability |
| Contested | Some priming effects, ego depletion |
