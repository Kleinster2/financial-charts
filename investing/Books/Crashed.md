# Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World

**Author:** [[Adam Tooze]]
**Published:** 2018
**Awards:** Lionel Gelber Prize, NYT Notable Book, Economist Book of the Year

The definitive history of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Tooze's central argument: this was not an American crisis that spread globally, but a **transatlantic financial crisis** rooted in the dollar-denominated balance sheets of European banks—with consequences that run directly through the eurozone crisis to Brexit, Trump, and the rise of illiberal populism.

## Central thesis

**Not a dollar crisis, but a dollar funding crisis.**

The conventional fear was a "dollar crisis"—everyone selling dollars, fleeing US assets. What actually happened was the opposite: a dollar *funding* crisis where everyone desperately needed dollars.

| Expected | Actual |
|----------|--------|
| Flight from dollars | Scramble for dollars |
| US isolated | Transatlantic implosion |
| National crisis | Global macro-financial crisis |

**Why this matters:** European banks had built massive dollar-denominated liabilities through the eurodollar market (run primarily through the City of London). When liquidity markets froze, they had no source of dollar funding. [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] estimated European banks' dollar funding gap at **$2+ trillion**.

## Key arguments

### 1. The Fed saved European banks

The [[Federal Reserve]] became the reserve bank for the entire world through bilateral swap lines—lending dollars to other central banks who then lent to their domestic institutions.

> "We became the thirteenth district of the Federal Reserve System." — European central banker

This was self-protection, not charity. Without dollar liquidity, European fire sales of dollar assets would have deepened the US crash.

### 2. The eurozone crisis was not separate

> "To view the 2008 crisis chiefly through its impact on America is to fundamentally misunderstand its significance... The Eurozone crisis follows directly from the shock of 2008."

The European response—objecting to fiscal expansion, slow to backstop markets, protracted bailouts, German reticence on debt mutualization—nearly collapsed the entire project.

**The austerity mistake:** In summer 2012, IMF staff discovered they had systematically underestimated fiscal multipliers. Cutting €1 of government spending reduced economic activity by *more* than €1. "Bad economics destroyed the economic prospects for a generation of young people in Southern Europe."

### 3. Political consequences were direct

Tooze traces a causal chain from 2008 to populism:

| Date | Event | Connection |
|------|-------|------------|
| Oct 2008 | EU fails to aid Hungary | Eastern Europe takes note |
| Apr 2010 | Orbán's Fidesz wins Hungary | First illiberal populist government |
| 2010s | Southern European youth unemployment | Generation lost to austerity |
| 2016 | Brexit, Trump | "More about 2008 than 2012 had been" |

## Key data points

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| European banks' dollar funding gap | $2+ trillion |
| Fed swap lines deployed | $600B+ at peak |
| Greek GDP decline | -25% (2008-2013) |
| Spanish youth unemployment | 50%+ (2013) |
| IMF fiscal multiplier error | Underestimated by ~2x |

---

## Analytical innovations

**Macro-financial vs macro-economic:** Tooze argues we need to look at bank balance sheets and funding flows, not just national income accounts. The "Chimerica" (China-America imbalances) story was macro-economic; the actual crisis was macro-financial (transatlantic bank funding).

**North Atlantic finance:** The critical system wasn't US-China but US-Europe, mediated through the City of London's eurodollar market.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Dollar funding crises recur | Watch cross-currency basis swaps, swap line activation |
| Fed is global lender of last resort | Fed actions affect non-US assets |
| Austerity during deleveraging is destructive | Fiscal multipliers higher in downturns |
| Political consequences lag economic | Crisis → populism pipeline takes years |
| European institutional weakness | ECB constrained vs Fed flexibility |

---

## Reception

Reviewers called it "the authoritative account" of the crisis. Praised for:
- Explaining Fed's alphabet soup of emergency facilities
- Detailing "byzantine political bargaining" in Europe
- Connecting financial mechanics to political outcomes
