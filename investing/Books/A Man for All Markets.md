# A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market

**Author:** Edward O. Thorp
**Published:** 2017

The autobiography of the original quant—the mathematician who first proved gambling could be beaten systematically, then applied the same principles to Wall Street. Thorp invented card counting, created the first wearable computer, pioneered convertible arbitrage, and achieved market-beating returns for decades. He did it all before Simons, before Black-Scholes, before quant was a word.

## Core thesis

> "The key to success in gambling and investing is the same: find situations where you have an edge, size your bets appropriately, and let mathematics do the rest."

Thorp's insight: both casinos and markets are beatable if you:
1. Find a mathematical edge
2. Manage risk with proper bet sizing
3. Execute systematically
4. Stay disciplined

## Part 1: Beating the casinos

### Blackjack and card counting

Thorp's 1962 book *Beat the Dealer* proved blackjack could be beaten:

| Discovery | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Cards have memory | High cards favor player |
| Counting works | Track the deck composition |
| Bet sizing matters | Bigger bets when edge is higher |

**The Kelly Criterion:** Thorp applied mathematician John Kelly's formula—bet a fraction of bankroll proportional to edge divided by odds. This maximizes long-term growth while avoiding ruin.

### Roulette and the first wearable computer

In 1961, Thorp and Claude Shannon (father of information theory) built a shoe-mounted computer to predict where a roulette ball would land:

| Innovation | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Device | Cigarette-pack sized, toe-operated |
| Method | Predicted ball sector from wheel speed |
| Edge | ~44% advantage |
| Outcome | Worked, but too fragile for casino conditions |

**Historical significance:** The first wearable computer, decades before smartphones.

## Part 2: Beating the market

### Convertible arbitrage (1967-1988)

Thorp founded Princeton Newport Partners with Jay Regan:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Annual return | ~20% (before fees) |
| Losing years | Zero |
| Sharpe ratio | ~2.0+ |
| Strategy | Convertible bond arbitrage |

**The strategy:** Buy underpriced convertible bonds, hedge with short stock positions. The mispricing was systematic; the math was clear.

### The warrant pricing formula

In 1967, Thorp derived what would become known as the Black-Scholes formula—years before Black and Scholes published:

| Thorp's timing | Black-Scholes |
|---------------|---------------|
| 1967 (derived privately) | 1973 (published) |
| Used for trading | Won Nobel Prize |
| Kept secret | Made famous |

**Thorp's choice:** He realized publishing would eliminate his edge. He traded instead.

### Statistical arbitrage

After Princeton Newport, Thorp consulted for various funds and developed statistical arbitrage strategies:

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Pairs trading | Long/short correlated stocks |
| Mean reversion | Bet on prices returning to historical relationships |
| Factor models | Systematic risk decomposition |

## Key principles

### The Kelly Criterion

> "Bet a fraction of your bankroll equal to your edge divided by the odds."

| Situation | Kelly bet |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1% edge, even odds | Bet 1% |
| 10% edge, even odds | Bet 10% |
| 1% edge, 2:1 odds | Bet 0.5% |

**Why it works:** Maximizes geometric growth rate. Bet too big → eventual ruin. Bet too small → suboptimal growth.

### The importance of edge

| Without edge | With edge |
|--------------|-----------|
| Gambling | Investing |
| Negative expected value | Positive expected value |
| House always wins | You can win |

**Thorp's test:** If you can't quantify your edge, you don't have one.

### Risk management

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Bet sizing** | Kelly or fractional Kelly |
| **Diversification** | Uncorrelated bets reduce variance |
| **Leverage limits** | Never risk ruin |
| **Liquidity** | Always be able to exit |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Quantify your edge** | If you can't measure it, it's not real |
| **Size matters** | Kelly Criterion for position sizing |
| **Secrets have value** | Thorp didn't publish his options formula |
| **Arbitrage erodes** | Edges get competed away |
| **Discipline beats genius** | Systematic > discretionary |

### Thorp vs. Simons

| Ed Thorp | Jim Simons |
|----------|------------|
| Started earlier (1960s) | Started later (1980s) |
| Smaller scale | Massive scale |
| Published *Beat the Dealer* | Total secrecy |
| Accessible explanations | Black box |
| Modest wealth (~$800M) | Billionaire (~$25B) |

**Thorp's advantage:** He explained his thinking. We can learn from him.

## The Princeton Newport raid

In 1987, Rudy Giuliani's prosecutors raided Princeton Newport:

| Event | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Charge | Tax fraud (disputed parking of stock) |
| Result | Firm closed; partners later acquitted on most charges |
| Thorp's view | Overzealous prosecution; the trades were legal |

**The lesson:** Even legal strategies can attract unwanted attention.

## Life lessons

Thorp's broader philosophy:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compound knowledge** | Learning builds on learning |
| **Think independently** | Conventional wisdom is often wrong |
| **Live below your means** | Wealth is optionality |
| **Health matters** | Exercise, diet, sleep |
| **Time with family** | Thorp prioritized this over more wealth |
