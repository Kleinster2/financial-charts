# Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike

**Author:** Phil Knight
**Published:** 2016
**Coverage:** 1962-1980 (founding through IPO)

Phil Knight's memoir of building Nike from a $50 loan to a global brand. Unlike typical business books, *Shoe Dog* is honest about the chaos, near-bankruptcies, and luck involved. Knight's thesis: building a company is less about strategy and more about persistence through constant crisis.

## Core thesis

> "The cowards never started and the weak died along the way. That leaves us."

Knight's lessons:
- Entrepreneurship is suffering punctuated by small victories
- Cash flow problems never end (until they do, suddenly)
- Relationships matter more than plans
- Belief in the product sustains you through everything else

## The origin story

### The "Crazy Idea" (1962)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Stanford MBA paper | Proposed importing Japanese running shoes |
| Trip to Japan | Knight, 24, visited Onitsuka Tiger |
| First deal | Became US distributor for Tiger shoes |
| Initial investment | $50 from his father |
| Company name | Blue Ribbon Sports (Nike came later) |

**The insight:** Japanese cameras had disrupted German cameras. Knight believed Japanese shoes could do the same to German shoes (Adidas, Puma).

### The early years

| Year | Revenue | Crisis |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1964 | $8,000 | Selling from car trunk |
| 1966 | $84,000 | First employee (Jeff Johnson) |
| 1969 | $300,000 | Onitsuka trying to cut them out |
| 1971 | $1.3M | Launched own brand: Nike |
| 1972 | $3.2M | Sued by Onitsuka |

**The constant:** Always out of money. Always one crisis from death.

## The team

### The "Buttfaces"

Knight's name for his inner circle of misfits:

| Person | Role | Background |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Bill Bowerman** | Co-founder, product | Track coach who invented the waffle sole |
| **Jeff Johnson** | First employee, soul | True believer; named the company "Nike" |
| **Bob Woodell** | Operations | Paralyzed athlete; managed chaos |
| **Del Hayes** | Finance | Kept them barely solvent |
| **Rob Strasser** | Marketing | Later architect of Air Jordan |

**Knight's insight:** He hired passionate people, not professionals. None had relevant experience. All believed.

### Bill Bowerman

| Contribution | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Waffle iron sole | Created Nike's first innovation |
| Athlete testing | Constant product improvement |
| Credibility | Oregon track coach gave legitimacy |
| "If you have a body, you are an athlete" | The Nike philosophy |

## The crises

### The Onitsuka betrayal

| What happened | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Onitsuka tried to find new US distributor | Knight discovered it during Japan visit |
| Could have destroyed the company | Accelerated plan to launch own brand |
| Lawsuit ensued | Nike won; launched independence |

### The FBI investigation

| Accusation | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Customs fraud (valuing imports too low) | Common industry practice, but still risky |
| Years of investigation | Enormous distraction |
| Resolution | Settled; company survived |

### The bank problems

| Pattern | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Growing too fast | Constantly |
| Banks pulling credit lines | Repeatedly |
| Finding new banks | Every few years |
| Living on the edge | Always |

**The lesson:** Growth requires capital. Banks don't like funding growth. This tension nearly killed Nike multiple times.

## Knight's philosophy

### On entrepreneurship

> "Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results."

### On failure

> "The better you get, the more you realize you still need to learn."

### On money

> "Money wasn't the point. It was never the point. But it was the score, and the score mattered."

### On competition

> "Life is growth. You grow or you die."
