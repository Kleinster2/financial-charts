# The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future

**Author:** Sebastian Mallaby
**Published:** 2022
**Recognition:** From the author of More Money Than God

The definitive history of venture capital, from its origins in the 1950s through the modern era of mega-funds and unicorns. Mallaby's thesis: VC's power-law returns—where a tiny fraction of bets generate nearly all profits—create a unique investment discipline that has funded the technologies reshaping the world.

## Core thesis

> "Venture capital is noteli about diversification. It's about finding the extreme outliers—the companies that return 100x or 1000x—because in a power-law distribution, everything else is noise."

The math:
- ~65% of VC investments lose money
- ~25% return 1-5x
- ~10% return 5x+
- ~1% return 50x+ (and drive fund returns)

**The implication:** VCs must swing for home runs. Base hits don't matter.

## The power law explained

| Normal distribution | Power law distribution |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Returns cluster around mean | Extreme outliers dominate |
| Diversification reduces risk | Concentration drives returns |
| Average matters | Only the best matters |
| Skill = consistency | Skill = finding the 100x |

### Fund math example

| Investment | Outcome | Return |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 9 companies | Fail | $0 |
| 1 company | 100x | $100M → $10B |
| **Fund total** | | $100M → $10B (100x) |

**The lesson:** One Google erases a hundred failures.

## The history

### Era 1: The pioneers (1950s-1970s)

| Figure | Firm | Innovation |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Arthur Rock** | Davis & Rock | Funded Fairchild, Intel; invented modern VC |
| **Tom Perkins** | Kleiner Perkins | Partnered with entrepreneurs; hands-on model |
| **Don Valentine** | Sequoia | Funded Atari, Apple, Cisco; market-first approach |

**Key insight:** Early VCs weren't just financiers—they were company builders who sat on boards and recruited executives.

### Era 2: The boom (1980s-1990s)

| Firm | Key investments | Style |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Kleiner Perkins** | Genentech, Amazon, Google | Technology visionaries |
| **Sequoia** | Yahoo, Google, PayPal | Rigorous, founder-friendly |
| **Benchmark** | eBay (100x) | Equal partnership, small fund |

**The eBay deal:** Benchmark's $6.7M investment returned $5B—the defining power-law outcome.

### Era 3: The mega-funds (2000s-2020s)

| Trend | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Larger funds | Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global |
| Growth equity blur | SoftBank Vision Fund ($100B) |
| Global expansion | DST (Russia), Sequoia China |
| Founder-friendly terms | Competition for deals |

## Key chapters

### Sequoia and the "prepared mind"

Don Valentine's philosophy: invest in markets, not just founders.

| Valentine's questions | What he's assessing |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "What's the market size?" | Opportunity scale |
| "Why now?" | Timing |
| "Why will you win?" | Competitive advantage |

**Sequoia's record:** Apple, Cisco, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Airbnb—arguably the best track record in VC history.

### Benchmark and equality

Benchmark's innovations:
- Equal partnership (no hierarchy)
- Small funds (~$500M)
- Focus on Series A
- One partner per deal (accountability)

**The eBay lesson:** Bob Kagle's $6.7M became $5B. One deal, one partner, one fund-maker.

### Andreessen Horowitz and the platform

Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz's 2009 innovation:

| Traditional VC | a16z model |
|---------------|------------|
| Partners + associates | 150+ person team |
| Board seats | Full-service platform |
| Advice | Recruiting, PR, sales help |
| Passive support | Active company-building |

**The bet:** Companies need more than money; VCs should be service providers.

### SoftBank and the mega-check

Masayoshi Son's Vision Fund:

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Fund size | $100B |
| Check size | $100M-$1B+ |
| Thesis | Fund the winners so aggressively they can't lose |

**The problem:** Power laws don't scale linearly. Larger checks don't guarantee larger outcomes.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Power law thinking** | Don't optimize for average; optimize for outliers |
| **Market size matters** | Small markets can't produce big outcomes |
| **Timing is critical** | "Why now?" is the key question |
| **Founder quality compounds** | The best founders attract the best people |
| **Concentration > diversification** | In power-law domains |

### For LPs (investors in VC funds)

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Top quartile persists | Returns are more persistent than other asset classes |
| Access matters | Best funds are oversubscribed |
| Vintage year matters | Entry point affects returns significantly |
| Fees compound | 2/20 over 10 years is expensive |

## China and globalization

Mallaby covers VC's expansion:

| Market | Key players | Notable investments |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **China** | Sequoia China, HongShan | Alibaba, ByteDance, Meituan |
| **India** | Sequoia India, Accel | Flipkart, Ola, Freshworks |
| **Europe** | Index, Accel | Spotify, Klarna, Revolut |

**The pattern:** American firms exported the model; local champions emerged.

## Critiques of VC

| Critique | Mallaby's view |
|----------|---------------|
| Funds the privileged | True, but expanding |
| Creates bubbles | Sometimes, but also funds real innovation |
| Encourages "blitzscaling" | Mixed—sometimes necessary, sometimes wasteful |
| Returns are declining | Unclear; more capital, but also more opportunities |
