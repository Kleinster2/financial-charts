# A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing

**Author:** Burton G. Malkiel
**First Published:** 1973
**Current Edition:** 13th (2023, 50th anniversary)
**Sold:** 1.5+ million copies

The case for passive investing. Malkiel argues that stock prices follow a "random walk"—future movements are unpredictable because current prices already reflect all known information. Since no one can consistently beat the market, the intelligent strategy is low-cost index funds held for the long term.

## Core thesis

**The random walk hypothesis:**

> Stock price movements are fundamentally unpredictable. Trying to forecast them is futile.

**Why?** The efficient market hypothesis (EMH): prices reflect all available information. New information—by definition—is unpredictable, so price changes are unpredictable.

**The implication:** Active management is a losing game after fees.

## Malkiel's position on EMH

Malkiel isn't naive about market efficiency:

> "The market's not perfectly efficient. The market makes mistakes. And sometimes it makes doozies of mistakes."

But:

> "It is extremely hard to beat."

| What EMH says | What EMH doesn't say |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Prices reflect available information | Prices are always correct |
| You can't consistently beat the market | Bubbles don't exist |
| Active management underperforms on average | No one ever outperforms |

---

## The evidence against active management

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Most funds underperform benchmarks | Stock picking doesn't work on average |
| Past performance doesn't predict future | Last year's winners become losers |
| Fees compound against you | 1% annually destroys returns over decades |
| Survivorship bias masks failures | You only see funds that didn't close |

**The famous line:**

> "A blindfolded chimpanzee throwing darts at the Wall Street Journal could select a portfolio that would do as well as the experts."

## The recommended strategy

### Core approach

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Buy index funds** | Low-cost, diversified exposure |
| **Hold for long term** | Don't try to time the market |
| **Keep costs low** | Expense ratios matter enormously |
| **Diversify broadly** | Stocks, bonds, international |
| **Rebalance periodically** | Maintain target allocation |

### Asset allocation by age

Malkiel suggests adjusting stock/bond mix with age:

| Age | Stocks | Bonds/Cash |
|-----|--------|------------|
| 20s | 90% | 10% |
| 40s | 70% | 30% |
| 60s | 50% | 50% |
| Retired | 30-40% | 60-70% |

## Critique of alternatives

| Strategy | Malkiel's view |
|----------|----------------|
| Technical analysis | Astrology for finance; no predictive power |
| Fundamental analysis | Works in theory, but everyone does it, so edge is arbitraged away |
| Factor investing | May work, but factors get crowded |
| Market timing | Impossible; missing best days devastates returns |

---

## The author's credibility

Malkiel isn't purely academic:
- Investment analyst on Wall Street
- Chaired insurance company investment committee
- Director of major investment firm
- Princeton economics professor

This blend of practice and theory gives the argument weight.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Index funds for core holdings | Vanguard, low-cost ETFs |
| Minimize fees | Every basis point matters |
| Stay the course | Don't panic sell in downturns |
| Time in market > timing market | Start early, stay invested |
| Humility about forecasting | You probably can't beat the market |

---

## The counterargument

Value investors ([[The Intelligent Investor]], [[Security Analysis]]) argue:
- EMH is wrong; markets are often irrational
- Patient analysis can identify mispricing
- Buffett, Lynch, and others beat the market for decades

Malkiel would respond: survivorship bias; they're the rare exceptions that prove nothing for the average investor.
