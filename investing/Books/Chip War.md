# Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology

**Author:** Chris Miller
**Published:** 2022
**Awards:** FT Business Book of the Year, CFR Arthur Ross Award, IEEE History Prize, NYT Bestseller

Miller's thesis: semiconductors are the new oil—the resource on which economic and military power depends. The book traces how the US built chip dominance, how [[TSMC]] made Taiwan indispensable, and why the US-China struggle for chip supremacy will define the 21st century.

## Core thesis

> "Microchips are the new oil—the scarce resource on which the modern world depends."

Everything runs on chips: smartphones, cars, missiles, AI, medical devices. Control over chip supply chains is now a matter of national security.

## The supply chain geography

| Segment | Dominant player | Concentration |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Design software (EDA)** | US (Cadence, Synopsys) | ~90% |
| **Advanced logic chips** | Taiwan ([[TSMC]]) | ~90% |
| **Memory** | South Korea (Samsung, SK Hynix) | ~70% |
| **EUV lithography** | Netherlands ([[ASML]]) | 100% |
| **AI/GPU design** | US ([[NVIDIA]], AMD) | ~90% |

**The bottleneck:** ASML is the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. Without EUV, cutting-edge chips are impossible.

## Taiwan's "silicon shield"

[[TSMC]] produces 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. This makes Taiwan:

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Indispensable to global tech | China can't afford to destroy fabs |
| Geopolitically protected | US has strong interest in Taiwan's security |
| Vulnerable to blockade | Supply disruption would cripple industries worldwide |

> "Taiwan's semiconductor industry serves as a strategic asset, often referred to as a 'silicon shield.'"

## The China challenge

China spends more on chip imports than oil. Its response:

| Initiative | Scale | Result so far |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Big Fund (2014) | $20B+ | Limited success |
| Made in China 2025 | National priority | Progress in mature nodes |
| Total investment | ~$150B | Still 5-10 years behind in advanced chips |

**The problem:** Chips require the entire supply chain—design tools, equipment, materials, know-how. China lacks each piece.

**US response:** Export controls on advanced chips and equipment to China; CHIPS Act subsidies for domestic production.

## Key historical moments

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **1950s-60s** | US invents transistor, integrated circuit |
| **1970s-80s** | Japan threatens US dominance; trade war |
| **1987** | Morris Chang founds TSMC; foundry model born |
| **1990s** | US refocuses on design; outsources manufacturing |
| **2000s** | TSMC becomes indispensable |
| **2010s** | China's chip push accelerates |
| **2020s** | US-China tech war; export controls |

## Investment relevance

| Theme | Positioning |
|-------|-------------|
| **TSMC dominance** | Foundry pricing power; but geopolitical risk |
| **Equipment scarcity** | [[ASML]], Applied Materials, Lam Research |
| **US reshoring** | Intel, GlobalFoundries; CHIPS Act beneficiaries |
| **China domestic** | SMIC, Huawei; limited by equipment access |
| **AI demand** | [[NVIDIA]], AMD; compute bottleneck |
