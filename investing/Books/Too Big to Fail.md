## Why Lehman failed

The book's central drama: why was Lehman allowed to fail when Bear Stearns and AIG were saved?

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| No buyer | Barclays walked away; Bank of America chose Merrill |
| Legal constraints | Treasury claimed it lacked authority without buyer |
| Fuld's denial | Refused to accept low valuations until too late |
| Moral hazard concern | Officials wanted to show they wouldn't bail out everyone |

**The irony:** Letting Lehman fail triggered the systemic crisis TARP was then needed to address.

## TARP's creation

The Troubled Asset Relief Program emerged from a weekend of panic:

1. Money market fund "broke the buck" (Sep 16)
2. Commercial paper market froze
3. Paulson and Bernanke warned Congress of Great Depression 2.0
4. First vote failed; markets crashed
5. Revised bill passed with $700B authorization

## Critique

Reviewers note the book is "incredibly light on analysis"—it documents what happened but not why the system was so fragile or what should change. It's journalism, not political economy.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Counterparty risk is systemic | One failure cascades |
| Government will intervene | But timing/form unpredictable |
| Weekend risk is real | Major decisions happen when markets closed |
| Liquidity evaporates instantly | Cash is king in crisis |
| Personality matters | Individual decisions shaped outcomes |
