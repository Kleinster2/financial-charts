# Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

**Author:** Philip A. Fisher
**Published:** 1958
**Status:** Continuously in print for 65+ years

The growth investing bible—the counterpart to Graham's value approach. Fisher argued that buying and holding outstanding companies is more profitable than buying cheap mediocre ones. Warren Buffett famously said he is "85% Graham and 15% Fisher"—but that 15% transformed his approach to quality.

## Core thesis

> "The greatest investment reward comes to those who by good luck or good sense find the occasional company that over the years can grow in sales and profits far more than industry as a whole."

Fisher's insight:
- A few great companies generate most of the wealth
- Quality matters more than cheapness
- Hold winners for years or decades
- Qualitative research beats quantitative screens

## The 15 points

Fisher's checklist for finding outstanding companies:

### Growth potential

| Point | Question |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Does the company have products with sufficient market potential for sizable sales growth for several years? |
| 2 | Does management have determination to develop new products when current ones mature? |
| 3 | How effective is R&D relative to company size? |

### Competitive position

| Point | Question |
|-------|----------|
| 4 | Does it have an above-average sales organization? |
| 5 | Does it have a worthwhile profit margin? |
| 6 | What is it doing to maintain or improve margins? |
| 7 | Does it have outstanding labor and personnel relations? |
| 8 | Does it have outstanding executive relations? |
| 9 | Does it have depth to management? |

### Management quality

| Point | Question |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | How good are cost analysis and accounting controls? |
| 11 | Are there other aspects of the business that give clues to competitive advantage? |
| 12 | Does the company have short-range or long-range outlook on profits? |
| 13 | Will growth require equity financing that dilutes existing shareholders? |
| 14 | Does management talk freely when things go well but clam up when problems arise? |
| 15 | Does management have unquestionable integrity? |

## The "scuttlebutt" method

Fisher's research approach:

| Source | What to learn |
|--------|---------------|
| Competitors | "What do you think of Company X?" |
| Suppliers | Payment practices, order trends |
| Customers | Product quality, service, loyalty |
| Former employees | Culture, management, problems |
| Industry experts | Competitive position, trends |
| Management | After all other research is done |

**The key:** Talk to management *last*. First, learn enough to ask intelligent questions and detect evasions.

## When to sell

Fisher's three reasons to sell:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| 1. You made a mistake | Original thesis was wrong |
| 2. Company no longer qualifies | Management deteriorated; competitive position weakened |
| 3. Better opportunity | Rare—requires overwhelming evidence |

**When NOT to sell:**

| Bad reason | Why it's wrong |
|------------|----------------|
| Stock went up a lot | Winners keep winning |
| Stock went down | Price ≠ value |
| Market is high | Can't time markets |
| To lock in gains | Taxes and missing future gains |

> "If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is—almost never."

## Fisher vs. Graham

| Graham | Fisher |
|--------|--------|
| Quantitative | Qualitative |
| Buy cheap | Buy quality |
| Margin of safety in price | Margin of safety in business |
| Diversify broadly | Concentrate in best ideas |
| Sell when fairly valued | Hold indefinitely |
| "Cigar butts" | "Growth stocks" |

**Buffett's synthesis:** Buy quality companies (Fisher) at reasonable prices (Graham) and hold forever (both).

## The holding period

> "I have already made up my mind that the only reason for selling a stock is if the company turns out not to be what you thought it was."

Fisher's famous holdings:

| Company | Held |
|---------|------|
| Motorola | 21 years |
| Texas Instruments | Decades |
| Dow Chemical | Long-term |

**The math:** A company that compounds at 15% for 20 years turns $1 into $16. Selling early to "lock in gains" destroys this compounding.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Quality over cheapness** | Great businesses compound |
| **Qualitative research** | Talk to people, not just spreadsheets |
| **Concentrated portfolios** | Own your best ideas |
| **Hold winners** | Don't sell just because stock rose |
| **Management matters** | Integrity and capability are essential |

### The Fisher checklist today

| Original question | Modern application |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| R&D effectiveness | Innovation pipeline |
| Sales organization | Go-to-market strength |
| Profit margins | Unit economics |
| Labor relations | Glassdoor, culture |
| Management depth | Succession planning |
| Integrity | Insider transactions, related parties |

## Buffett on Fisher

> "I'm 15% Fisher."

> "A wonderful company at a fair price is better than a fair company at a wonderful price."

**The evolution:** Young Buffett was pure Graham (cigar butts). Munger and Fisher converted him to quality.
