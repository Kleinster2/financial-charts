# The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power

**Author:** Daniel Yergin
**Published:** 1991
**Awards:** Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (1992)
**Adapted:** PBS/BBC television series

The definitive history of the oil industry from 1850s Pennsylvania to the 1991 Gulf War. Yergin's thesis: oil transformed from a commercial commodity into the strategic resource that shaped the 20th century—fueling wars, creating fortunes, and defining geopolitics.

## Core thesis

> "Oil—and all the struggles surrounding its discovery, acquisition, and distribution—created our modern world."

The book traces oil's transition:

| Era | Oil's role |
|-----|------------|
| 1860s-1900s | Commercial commodity (lighting, lubrication) |
| 1900s-1940s | Strategic military resource |
| 1950s-1970s | Foundation of industrial economy |
| 1970s-present | Geopolitical weapon |

## The title's origin

From Winston Churchill's *World Crisis* (1923), describing the British Admiralty's 1912 decision to convert the Royal Navy from coal to oil:

> "The 'great gamble' of the British Admiralty... in the absence of an assured supply."

Churchill called oil "the prize"—the resource worth risking everything for.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Energy is strategic | Geopolitics drives prices beyond supply/demand |
| Booms and busts recur | Oil has always cycled |
| Technology changes the game | Drilling innovation creates new supply |
| Cartels have limits | OPEC's power waxes and wanes |
| Substitution is slow | Transitions take decades |
