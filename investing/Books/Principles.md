# Principles: Life and Work

**Author:** Ray Dalio
**Published:** 2017
**Context:** Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund

Ray Dalio's attempt to codify the principles that guided his life and built Bridgewater into a $150B+ AUM juggernaut. The book covers both life principles (how to think and live) and work principles (how to build organizations). It's part autobiography, part management philosophy, part investment framework.

## Core thesis

> "Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life."

Dalio's approach:
- Write down your principles explicitly
- Apply them consistently
- Refine them based on results
- Systematize decision-making

## Part I: Where I'm coming from

### Dalio's journey

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1949 | Born in Queens, NY |
| 1975 | Founded Bridgewater in apartment |
| 1982 | Wrongly predicted depression; nearly went broke |
| 1991 | Developed "Pure Alpha" strategy |
| 2008 | Predicted financial crisis; positioned correctly |
| 2011 | Bridgewater becomes largest hedge fund |
| 2017 | Published Principles |

**The 1982 lesson:** Dalio went on TV predicting a depression. He was spectacularly wrong. This humiliation led to his core insight: radical open-mindedness and systematic thinking.

## Part II: Life principles

### 1. Embrace reality and deal with it

> "Truth—an accurate understanding of reality—is the essential foundation for any good outcome."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Be radically open-minded | Seek disconfirming evidence |
| Be radically transparent | Share information freely |
| Look at the machine from above | See patterns, not just events |

### 2. Use the 5-step process

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Set goals | Know what you want |
| 2. Identify problems | What's in the way? |
| 3. Diagnose problems | Root cause analysis |
| 4. Design solutions | Create a plan |
| 5. Execute | Do the work |

**The insight:** Most people are better at some steps than others. Know your weaknesses; get help.

### 3. Be radically open-minded

> "The greatest tragedy of mankind comes from the inability of people to have thoughtful disagreement."

| Closed-minded | Open-minded |
|---------------|-------------|
| Defensive about being wrong | Curious about being wrong |
| Statements | Questions |
| "I know" | "How do you know?" |
| Argues to win | Argues to learn |

### 4. Understand that people are wired differently

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Psychometric testing | Know yourself and others |
| Different strengths | Play to them |
| No "right" personality | Complementary teams |

Bridgewater uses personality assessments extensively to match people to roles.

## Part III: Work principles

### Idea meritocracy

> "An idea meritocracy is a system in which the best ideas win, no matter who they come from."

| Component | How it works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Radical truth | Say what you think |
| Radical transparency | Share information |
| Believability weighting | Better track record = more weight |
| Algorithmic decision-making | Systematize where possible |

### The "dot collector"

Bridgewater's meeting tool:

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Real-time ratings | Participants rate each other's contributions |
| Tracked over time | Builds credibility scores |
| Transparent | Everyone sees everyone's ratings |

**The goal:** Make implicit judgments explicit and data-driven.

### Hiring and culture

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Hire for values first | Skills can be taught |
| Match people to roles | Based on assessed capabilities |
| Train constantly | Systematic development |
| Fire quickly | When fit is wrong |

---

## The investment principles

Less detailed in the book, but Bridgewater's approach:

### All Weather portfolio

| Asset class | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Stocks | Growth exposure |
| Long-term bonds | Deflation protection |
| Commodities | Inflation protection |
| TIPS | Inflation protection |

**The insight:** Balance risk across economic environments, not just across assets.

### Pure Alpha

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Systematic | Rules-based |
| Diversified | Many uncorrelated bets |
| Global macro | Currencies, bonds, commodities, equities |
| Risk parity | Size positions by risk, not dollars |

---

## The controversies

| Criticism | Dalio's response |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Cult-like culture | "Radical transparency is uncomfortable but effective" |
| Surveillance | "Recording helps us learn and be accurate" |
| Harsh feedback | "Short-term pain for long-term gain" |
| Ego-driven | "The principles apply to me too" |

**Employee reactions:** Some thrive; many leave quickly. Bridgewater has high turnover but also fierce loyalty from those who stay.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Systematize decisions** | Write down your process |
| **Seek disconfirmation** | Find people who disagree |
| **Diversify across environments** | All Weather thinking |
| **Know yourself** | Play to your strengths |
| **Learn from mistakes** | Treat errors as data |

### For individual investors

| Dalio principle | Personal application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Radical open-mindedness | Seek out bear cases |
| Five-step process | Goals → problems → diagnosis → design → execute |
| Know your weaknesses | Get help where you're weak |
| Principles-based | Write down your investment rules |
