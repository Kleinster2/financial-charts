**Author:** Brad Stone

**Updated:** 2021 (new epilogue)
**Awards:** FT/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year

The definitive account of Amazon's rise from online bookstore to everything store to cloud computing giant. Stone's thesis: Jeff Bezos built Amazon through relentless customer obsession, long-term thinking, and a willingness to be misunderstood—creating a company that reshaped retail, technology, and expectations.

## Core thesis

> "Bezos built Amazon on a few core principles: customer obsession over competitor focus, willingness to invent, long-term thinking, and operational excellence. These weren't slogans—they were decisions that cost billions in the short term."

The Amazon way:
- Customer obsession (not competitor obsession)
- Long-term thinking (ignore quarterly pressure)
- Willingness to be misunderstood (for years)
- High-velocity decision making
- Frugality as virtue

## The origin story

### The 1994 decision

| Factor | Bezos's analysis |
|--------|-----------------|
| Internet growth | 2,300% per year |
| What to sell? | Books: huge selection, commoditized |
| Where to locate? | Seattle (tech talent, no sales tax, near book distributor) |
| Name? | Cadabra → Amazon (largest river; starts with A) |

**The regret minimization framework:** Bezos imagined himself at 80, looking back. Would he regret not trying? The answer was obvious.

### Early Amazon

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1994 | Founded in garage |
| 1995 | Launched; $20K/week in first month |
| 1997 | IPO at $18/share |
| 1999 | $1.6B revenue; still losing money |
| 2001 | First profit (barely) |

## The principles

### Customer obsession

> "We're not competitor obsessed, we're customer obsessed. We start with what the customer needs and work backwards."

| Example | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 1-Click ordering | Patented; reduced friction |
| Free shipping | Trained customers to expect it |
| Customer reviews | Transparency over sales |
| Prime | Changed shopping behavior |

### Long-term thinking

> "We are willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."

| Short-term pain | Long-term gain |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Negative margins for years | Market dominance |
| AWS investment before proven | $80B+ business |
| Prime free shipping losses | 200M+ subscribers |
| Kindle hardware at cost | Ecosystem lock-in |

### The flywheel

| Element | Feeds into |
|---------|------------|
| Lower prices | More customers |
| More customers | More sellers |
| More sellers | Better selection |
| Better selection | Better experience |
| Better experience | More customers |
| More volume | Lower costs |
| Lower costs | Lower prices |

## Key chapters

### The Kindle (2007)

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Publishers resistant | Paid advances for digital rights |
| No hardware experience | Hired team; acquired startups |
| Pricing | $9.99 for bestsellers (losing money) |

**Bezos's logic:** "If we don't cannibalize ourselves, someone else will."

### Amazon Web Services

| Origin | Internal infrastructure tools |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Insight | Others could use this |
| Launch | 2006 (S3, EC2) |
| Result | Created cloud computing industry |

**The surprise:** AWS wasn't the plan. It emerged from solving internal problems—then Bezos saw the bigger opportunity.

### The Marketplace

| First attempt | Auctions (failed—eBay too strong) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Pivot | Third-party sellers on Amazon |
| Result | >50% of sales now third-party |

**The tension:** Amazon competes with its own sellers. "Co-opetition" creates conflict but also selection.

## Bezos's methods

### The 6-pager

| Traditional meeting | Amazon meeting |
|--------------------|----------------|
| PowerPoint | 6-page narrative memo |
| Bullet points | Complete sentences |
| Presenter talks | Silent reading first |

**Why it works:** Forces clear thinking. Bullets hide fuzzy logic.

### Two-pizza teams

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Teams small enough to feed with two pizzas | Reduces coordination overhead |
| Autonomous | Own their roadmap |
| Metrics-driven | Clear accountability |

### "Disagree and commit"

| Traditional | Amazon |
|-------------|--------|
| Debate until consensus | Debate, decide, commit even if you disagree |
| Slow decisions | Fast decisions |
| Resentment | Alignment |

## The controversies

### Working conditions

| Criticism | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Warehouse conditions | Heat, pace, injuries |
| White-collar burnout | "Purposeful Darwinism" |
| High turnover | By design? |

**Stone's take:** Amazon is demanding by design. Bezos believes great people want to work hard.

### Market power

| Concern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Predatory pricing | Diapers.com acquisition |
| Seller data | Using sales data to compete |
| Monopoly power | Antitrust scrutiny |

---

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Customer obsession wins** | Focus on customers, not competitors |
| **Long-term thinking** | Ignore short-term earnings pressure |
| **Reinvestment > profits** | Amazon showed you can grow without profits |
| **Platform economics** | Marketplaces create moats |
| **Adjacent expansion** | AWS came from infrastructure investment |

### The Amazon model

| Metric | Traditional view | Amazon view |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Profit margin | Higher is better | Invest in growth |
| Free cash flow | Return to shareholders | Reinvest |
| Market share | Balance with profits | Maximize first |
