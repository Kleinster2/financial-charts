# Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World's Economy

**Author:** [[Adam Tooze]]
**Published:** 2021
**Awards:** Orwell Prize finalist

Real-time history of the COVID economic crisis and policy response. Tooze's thesis: the pandemic revealed that the neoliberal experiment has failed—markets cannot regulate existential risks—and central bankers (especially [[Jerome Powell]]) emerged as the unlikely heroes who prevented collapse through unprecedented intervention.

## Central thesis

**Neoliberalism's failure exposed.**

> "The idea that the natural envelope of economic activity could be ignored or left to markets to regulate was clearly out of touch with reality."

The pandemic was not just a health crisis but a convergence of biological, social, economic, and political risks—exactly the kind of systemic shock that market-driven governance cannot handle.

## Key arguments

### 1. The scale was unprecedented

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Global GDP contraction | -20% in weeks |
| Countries in simultaneous recession | 95% |
| Job losses | Hundreds of millions worldwide |

Never before had the entire world economy contracted so fast, nor had virtually all economies suffered simultaneously.

### 2. Central bankers as heroes

Tooze's protagonists are not healthcare workers but central bankers. [[Jerome Powell]] emerges as "pragmatic and decisive."

**March 2020 Fed actions:**
- Shored up Treasury market with collateralized short-term loans
- Dropped rates to zero
- Backstopped commercial paper
- Opened swap lines globally

These moves "paved the way for other reserve banks to act and for governments to approve emergency relief."

### 3. Fiscal response dwarfed 2008

| Stimulus | Amount | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CARES Act (2020) | $2.7 trillion | "Nigh on three times" Obama's 2009 stimulus |
| Speed of passage | Days | vs months of negotiation in 2008-09 |

The ease with which Congress passed CARES—compared to the grinding fight over 2009 stimulus—is evidence of neoliberalism's ideological collapse.

### 4. Geopolitical consequences

The book frames COVID as accelerating pre-existing fractures:
- US-China decoupling
- European institutional weakness
- Global South debt crises
- Populist politics

## Comparison to *Crashed*

| Dimension | *Crashed* (2018) | *Shutdown* (2021) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Crisis | 2008 financial | 2020 pandemic |
| Origin | Transatlantic bank funding | Biological shock |
| Fed role | Lender of last resort | Same, but faster/bigger |
| Political aftermath | Populism (delayed) | Populism (accelerated) |
| Written | 10 years after | Months after |

*Shutdown* applies the *Crashed* analytical framework in real-time.

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Central banks will intervene massively | Don't fight the Fed—applies globally |
| Fiscal constraints are political, not economic | "Anything we can afford to do, we can afford" |
| Systemic risks are underpriced | Tail risk hedging has value |
| Speed of policy response matters | Watch central bank reaction functions |
