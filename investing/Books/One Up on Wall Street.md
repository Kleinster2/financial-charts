# One Up on Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money in the Market

**Author:** Peter Lynch (with John Rothchild)
**Published:** 1989
**Context:** Written after Lynch's legendary run at Fidelity Magellan

The retail investor's bible—Lynch's argument that individual investors have advantages over professionals if they use them. His thesis: you encounter potential investments every day; the key is recognizing them, doing basic research, and having the patience to hold.

## Core thesis

> "The best stock to buy may be the one you already own."

Lynch's insight:
- Individual investors can spot trends before Wall Street
- You don't need complex models—you need common sense
- Know what you own and why you own it
- The stock market is full of opportunities if you look

## The six categories

Lynch classifies stocks into six types:

### 1. Slow growers

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Large, mature companies | Utilities |
| Grow at GDP rate (~2-4%) | Electric companies |
| Pay dividends | Stable but boring |
| Why own? | Income, safety |

### 2. Stalwarts

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Large companies, 10-12% growth | Coca-Cola, P&G |
| Solid performers | Won't double quickly |
| Good in recessions | Defensive |
| Expect | 30-50% gains, then sell |

### 3. Fast growers

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Small, aggressive companies | 20-25%+ growth |
| Lynch's favorites | High risk, high reward |
| Key question | Can they sustain growth? |
| Expect | Biggest winners come from here |

### 4. Cyclicals

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Earnings rise/fall with economy | Autos, airlines, steel |
| Timing is everything | Buy in recession |
| Easy to lose money | If you mistime |
| P/E is deceiving | Low P/E at peak earnings |

### 5. Turnarounds

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Troubled companies | Potential recovery |
| High risk | Can go to zero |
| High reward | If successful |
| Key question | Can they survive? |

### 6. Asset plays

| Characteristic | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Hidden assets | Real estate, patents, cash |
| Market ignores value | Not reflected in price |
| Patience required | May take years |
| Key question | What are assets worth? |

## "Buy what you know"

Lynch's famous advice:

| Observation | Potential investment |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Kids love a new toy | The toy company |
| Restaurant always packed | The restaurant chain |
| New product at work | The vendor |
| Mall store with lines | The retailer |

**The advantage:** You see trends before analysts write reports.

**The caveat:** This is the *starting point*, not the end. You still need to research the company.

## The two-minute drill

Before buying, know:

| Question | Why it matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Why am I interested? | The story |
| What must happen for success? | The thesis |
| What could go wrong? | The risks |

> "If you can't explain to a 10-year-old in two minutes or less why you own a stock, you shouldn't own it."

---

## The perfect stock

Lynch's checklist:

| Characteristic | Why it's good |
|----------------|---------------|
| Boring name/business | Analysts ignore it |
| Does something dull | Less competition |
| Does something disagreeable | Even less attention |
| Spinoff | Often mispriced |
| Institutions don't own it | Undiscovered |
| Insiders are buying | They know something |
| Company buys back shares | Management confident |
| Niche business | Hard to compete |
| People keep buying product | Recurring revenue |
| Technology user, not maker | Benefits without R&D risk |

---

## Warning signs

| Red flag | Why it's dangerous |
|----------|-------------------|
| Hot stock in hot industry | Everyone already owns it |
| "The next [famous company]" | Usually isn't |
| Diversification | "Diworsification" |
| Whisper stocks | If it's too secret to discuss... |
| Middleman company | Vulnerable to disintermediation |
| Customer concentration | One customer leaving = disaster |

---

## The P/E ratio

Lynch's favorite metric:

| P/E level | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| < growth rate | Potentially undervalued |
| = growth rate | Fairly valued |
| > growth rate | Potentially overvalued |

**The PEG ratio:** P/E divided by growth rate. Under 1.0 is attractive.

| Example | P/E | Growth | PEG |
|---------|-----|--------|-----|
| Company A | 20 | 25% | 0.8 (good) |
| Company B | 20 | 10% | 2.0 (expensive) |

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use your edge** | Your daily life reveals opportunities |
| **Know what you own** | Understand the story |
| **Categorize stocks** | Different types, different expectations |
| **Do basic research** | P/E, growth, balance sheet |
| **Be patient** | Winners take time |
| **Avoid hype** | Hot stocks are usually overpriced |

### For retail investors

| Advantage | How to use it |
|-----------|--------------|
| No benchmark pressure | Can hold cash, be patient |
| Small size | Can buy small-caps institutions can't |
| Time horizon | No quarterly performance pressure |
| Local knowledge | See trends in your community |

## Lynch's humility

> "I've always said that if you spend 13 minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 10 minutes."

> "Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market."

**His approach:** Ignore macro. Focus on individual companies.
