# Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

**Author:** Peter Thiel (with Blake Masters)
**Published:** 2014
**Origin:** Based on notes from Thiel's 2012 Stanford startup course

Thiel's contrarian manifesto on building transformative companies. His thesis: the best businesses create something entirely new ("0 to 1") rather than copying what exists ("1 to n"). Competition is for losers; monopoly is the goal. The book challenges conventional startup wisdom at every turn.

## Core thesis

> "Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."

The distinction:
- **0 to 1:** Creating something new (technology, vertical progress)
- **1 to n:** Copying what works (globalization, horizontal progress)

**Thiel's claim:** 0 to 1 creates exponentially more value.

## Competition is for losers

| Conventional wisdom | Thiel's view |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Competition makes you better | Competition destroys profits |
| Markets should be competitive | Monopoly is the goal |
| Compete to win | Don't compete at all |

### Why monopolies are good (for founders)

| Competitive market | Monopoly |
|-------------------|----------|
| Price = marginal cost | Price > marginal cost |
| Zero economic profit | Sustainable profits |
| Constant fighting | Build for long term |
| Commoditized | Differentiated |

**The insight:** In competitive markets, all value goes to consumers. In monopolies, creators capture value.

### The lies companies tell

| Monopolists say | Competitive companies say |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| "We're in a huge market" (to avoid antitrust) | "We're in a tiny market" (to seem dominant) |
| Google: "tech company" (not search monopoly) | Restaurants: "only British food in Palo Alto" |

## How to build a monopoly

### Start small, then monopolize

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Dominate a small market** | Better to own 100% of something than 1% of everything |
| **Expand concentrically** | Amazon: books → everything |
| **Don't disrupt** | Build something new; let incumbents ignore you |
| **Last mover advantage** | Be the last company in your category |

### Monopoly characteristics

| Advantage | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Proprietary technology** | Google's search algorithms |
| **Network effects** | Facebook's social graph |
| **Economies of scale** | Amazon's logistics |
| **Branding** | Apple's design premium |

**The 10x rule:** Proprietary technology must be 10x better than closest substitute to create real advantage.

---

## The contrarian question

> "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

| Good answer format | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| "Most people believe X, but the truth is the opposite of X" | "Most people think clean energy requires subsidies, but the best solar companies will be profitable without them" |

**Why it matters:** Great businesses are built on secrets—things that are true but not obvious.

### Where to find secrets

| Domain | Hidden knowledge |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Nature** | Scientific secrets (hard, getting harder) |
| **People** | What people don't know about themselves or won't say |

---

## The power law

> "The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined."

| Conventional diversification | Thiel's power law |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Spread bets to reduce risk | One company returns the fund |
| Many small wins | Focus on potential home runs |
| Portfolio approach | Concentrate on the best |

**Implication for founders:** Your company should be the best thing you could possibly be doing. If not, you're misallocating your most valuable resource (your time).

---

## Building the team

### Founding team

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Pre-existing relationship** | Founders need history together |
| **Complementary skills** | Technical + business |
| **Aligned vision** | Agreement on fundamentals |

### Early employees

> "A startup is a cult—or should be."

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "Why should the 20th employee join?" | You need a compelling answer |
| Not money (big companies pay more) | Not just equity |
| Not perks (big companies have better ones) | Mission + team |

---

## Investment relevance

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid competition** | Invest in monopolies, not competitors |
| **Power law** | One position can return the portfolio |
| **Technology > globalization** | 0 to 1 > 1 to n |
| **Small markets first** | Dominance in a niche beats presence in a big market |
| **Secrets** | The best companies know something others don't |

### Evaluating startups

| Question | What you're assessing |
|----------|----------------------|
| Can it be a monopoly? | Economics |
| What's the secret? | Proprietary insight |
| Does the team work? | Execution capability |
| Is timing right? | Market readiness |
| Is distribution solved? | Go-to-market |

---

## The future

Thiel's timeline:

| Scenario | Outlook |
|----------|---------|
| **Recurrent collapse** | Back to premodern cycles |
| **Plateau** | Stagnation at current level |
| **Extinction** | Self-destruction |
| **Takeoff** | Accelerating progress |

**His bet:** Definite optimism—the future will be better if we build it deliberately, not through incremental improvement.

## Critiques

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Monopoly is bad for society | Thiel: Creative monopolies create value; different from rent-seeking |
| "Secrets" is vague | Fair; the concept is more inspiring than actionable |
| Survivorship bias | He uses examples that worked; failures had secrets too |
| Contrarian for its own sake | Some conventional wisdom is actually right |
