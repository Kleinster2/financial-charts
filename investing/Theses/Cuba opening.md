## The thesis

Speculative thesis on US-Cuba normalization or regime change. Tourism, telecom, consumer sectors would benefit. 90 miles from Florida = unique proximity.

---

## Thesis summary

If Cuba opens to US business (via regime change, negotiated opening, or sanctions lift):

- 11M underserved consumers accessible
- Tourism boom (90 miles from Florida)
- [[Telecom]]/infrastructure buildout
- Remittance flows unrestricted
- Real estate development

**Catalyst watch:** [[Maduro capture 2026]] sets precedent + cuts Cuban oil subsidies.

## Why Cuba is different from Venezuela

| Factor | Venezuela | Cuba |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Prize | [[Oil]] (303B barrels) | Tourism, consumer market |
| US interest | Energy security | Diaspora politics, proximity |
| Distance | ~2,000 miles | 90 miles |
| Diaspora | Scattered | Florida (1.5M, politically active) |
| Resources | Massive oil | Limited (nickel, tourism) |
| Intervention likelihood | Happened (Jan 2026) | Lower (no oil prize) |

## Investment hierarchy

### Tier 1: [[Cruise]] lines (highest leverage)

| Company | Angle | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [[Carnival]] | Largest cruise operator | Had Cuba cruises (suspended) |
| [[Royal Caribbean]] | #2 cruise operator | Cuba-ready ships |
| Norwegian | #3 cruise operator | Caribbean focus |

**Why cruises:** 90 miles from Florida ports. Day trips possible. No hotel needed.

### Tier 2: Airlines/Hotels

| Company | Angle |
|---------|-------|
| [[American Airlines]] | Miami hub, had Cuba flights |
| JetBlue | Fort Lauderdale/Florida focus |
| Delta | Atlanta hub |
| Marriott | Had Havana hotel (first US brand) |
| Hilton | Development pipeline ready |
| [[Airbnb]] | Already operates (casa particulares) |

### Tier 3: [[Telecom]]/Infrastructure

| Company | Angle |
|---------|-------|
| [[AT&T]], [[Verizon]], [[T-Mobile]] | Cell/internet buildout |
| [[Starlink]] ([[Tesla]]) | Satellite internet |
| [[Caterpillar]] | Construction equipment |
| [[Deere]] | Agricultural equipment |

### Tier 4: Remittances/[[Fintech]]

| Company | Angle |
|---------|-------|
| Western Union | Traditional remittances |
| [[PayPal]] | Digital transfers |
| [[Block]] | Cash App for diaspora |
| Remitly, Wise | [[Fintech]] remittances |

### Tier 5: [[Consumer]]

| Company | Angle |
|---------|-------|
| [[Coca-Cola]] | Iconic (Cuba was early market) |
| [[PepsiCo]] | [[Consumer]] staples |
| [[Walmart]], [[Amazon]] | Retail entry |
| Procter & Gamble | [[Consumer]] goods |

## Bull case

- 90 miles from Florida = instant tourism demand
- 1.5M Cuban-Americans = built-in customer/investor base
- Pent-up demand (frozen since 1959)
- Venezuela precedent pressures regime
- [[Oil]] subsidies cut = economic pressure
- Infrastructure rebuild = multi-decade capex

---

## Bear case

- No regime change imminent
- US domestic politics (Florida voters)
- Embargo has survived 60+ years
- No oil = less US strategic interest
- [[China]]/[[Russia]] support regime
- Property claims messy (pre-Castro seizures)

---

## Signposts to watch

| [[Signal]] | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Cuban leadership | Dies, flees, negotiates | Consolidates |
| Venezuela oil | Cut off (pressure) | Continues somehow |
| US policy | Sanctions eased | Tightened |
| Protests | Grow (like 2021) | Suppressed |
| [[Cruise]] lines | Announce Cuba plans | Silence |
| Florida politics | Softens on Cuba | Hardline |

---

## Timeline

| Scenario | Probability | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Status quo | 60% | Indefinite |
| Gradual opening | 25% | 5-10 years |
| Rapid regime change | 10% | Unknown |
| US intervention (Venezuela-style) | 5% | Unlikely without oil |

**Key insight:** Unlike Venezuela, no oil means less US strategic urgency. Opening more likely from internal collapse than intervention.

## How to play it (speculative)

**If you believe opening likely:**
- Carnival, Royal Caribbean (cruise leverage)
- Marriott (first-mover in Havana)
- Western Union (remittance flow)

**Hedge approach:**
- These companies have Caribbean exposure anyway
- Cuba is optionality, not base case

---

## Evidence log

| Date | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 2026-01-05 | Maduro captured — Venezuela precedent set | Pressure on Cuban regime |
| 2026-01-05 | Venezuela oil subsidies at risk | Economic pressure on Cuba |
| — | No cruise line announcements yet | Thesis still speculative |
