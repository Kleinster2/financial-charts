# Long Broadcom

**Status**: New thesis — ASIC explosion underway
**Created**: 2025-12-30

## The thesis

Broadcom is the picks-and-shovels play on hyperscaler custom silicon. As AI labs and hyperscalers build proprietary chips to escape NVIDIA pricing, Broadcom captures design revenue regardless of who wins.

---

## The opportunity

### ASIC revenue explosion (Citi Research, Dec 2025)

| Fiscal Year | ASIC Revenue | Growth |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| F25 | $14.5B | — |
| F26E | $50.5B | +248% |
| F27E | $100B | +98% |

**Customer breakdown (F27E):**
- Google: $50B (TPUs)
- OpenAI: $20B (Titan)
- Anthropic: $4.4B
- xAI: $8B
- Others: $17.6B

This is a **7x revenue expansion** in 2 years.

## Why Broadcom wins

**Design expertise:**
- Decades of ASIC design experience
- Network switching silicon leadership
- Full-stack capability (compute + networking + memory integration)

**Customer relationships:**
- Google TPUs since v1
- OpenAI $10B deal (Oct 2025)
- Meta, Amazon, Apple, Softbank, ByteDance

**No alternatives at scale:**
- MediaTek emerging but small
- Marvell strong with Amazon only
- In-house design takes years to build

---

## Key risks

### Disintermediation

Hyperscalers want to cut out Broadcom's ~55% margins:
- **Google Zebrafish**: Sourcing wafers/memory directly, MediaTek for support chips
- **MediaTek wins**: TPUv7e, Maia 400, ByteDance APU
- **Meta RISC-V**: Building in-house with Rivos acquisition

If this accelerates, Broadcom loses ASP and margin.

### Customer concentration

| Risk | Exposure |
|------|----------|
| Top 5 customers | 40% of revenue |
| Google alone | Massive (TPU dependency) |
| Apple | $7B+ |

Google defection would be material.

### Non-AI weakness

- Non-AI semi down 30% from peak
- AI now 60%+ of semi revenue
- Dependency deepening

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] F26 ASIC revenue hits $50B+ guidance
- [ ] OpenAI Titan production on track (H2 2026)
- [ ] New hyperscaler design wins
- [ ] MediaTek disintermediation stays limited
- [ ] Networking revenue grows with AI clusters

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Google Zebrafish becomes majority of TPU volume
- [ ] MediaTek wins major new customers
- [ ] Hyperscalers bring design fully in-house
- [ ] AI capex slowdown
- [ ] Apple reduces orders materially

---

## Position sizing considerations

- Stock already up 50%+ YTD, $1.5T market cap
- High expectations = less room for error
- ASIC growth largely known — surprise must exceed current projections
- Consider waiting for pullback or expressing via options

**[[AI Race]]**: Broadcom benefits regardless of which AI lab wins

**[[Long memory]]**: Every ASIC needs HBM — Broadcom chips drive memory demand
