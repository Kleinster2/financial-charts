## The thesis

Wafer fab equipment makers benefit from the global fab buildout regardless of who wins the foundry wars. Picks and shovels for the construction phase.

---

## What is WFE?

Wafer Fab Equipment = the machines that build chips:

| Segment | What it does | Key players |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Lithography | Patterns circuits onto wafers | ASML (EUV monopoly) |
| Deposition | Deposits thin films | Lam Research, Applied Materials, [[ASM International]] (ALD) |
| Etch | Removes material to create structures | Lam Research, Applied Materials |
| Inspection | Checks for defects | KLA |
| Ion implant | Dopes silicon | Applied Materials |
| Dicing | Cuts wafers into individual dies | [[Disco]] (~80% share) |
| Die bonding | Attaches dies to substrates/packages | [[BESI]] (hybrid bonding leader) |

---

## Why it's a picks and shovels play

Every fab needs equipment regardless of:
- Who owns it (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Rapidus)
- Where it's built (Taiwan, Arizona, Texas, Korea, Japan)
- What it makes (logic, memory, AI chips)

Fab buildout = equipment orders. Simple.

---

## The players

### ASML (ASML)
- **Monopoly**: Only EUV lithography supplier
- **Moat**: 20+ years of R&D, no alternative
- **Exposure**: Leading edge logic (TSMC, Samsung, Intel)
- **Risk**: China restrictions limit TAM

### Lam Research (LRCX)
- **Segment**: Deposition and etch
- **Targets**: $25-27B revenue by CY2028, $30B at $1T semi industry
- **Exposure**: Memory (HBM buildout) + logic
- **Note**: Dep/etch intensity growing with advanced nodes

### Applied Materials (AMAT)
- **Segment**: Broadest portfolio — deposition, etch, implant
- **Exposure**: Memory + logic, most diversified
- **Scale**: Largest WFE company by revenue

### KLA (KLAC)
- **Segment**: Inspection and metrology
- **Moat**: Process control becomes more critical at smaller nodes
- **Exposure**: Yield improvement = more KLA tools

---

## Demand drivers

1. **CHIPS Act buildout**: Arizona (TSMC, Intel), Texas (Samsung, TI), Ohio (Intel)
2. **Japan resurgence**: Rapidus, TSMC Kumamoto
3. **Memory expansion**: HBM capacity, DRAM shortage response
4. **Leading edge race**: 2nm requires more equipment steps
5. **China domestic push**: Despite restrictions, building trailing edge

## Timing vs [[Long OSAT and test equipment]]

| Phase | Who benefits |
|-------|--------------|
| Construction (capex) | WFE — Lam, ASML, Applied, KLA |
| Production (opex) | OSAT/Test — ASE, Cohu |

WFE benefits first (fab construction), OSAT/test benefits later (production volume).

Current phase: Heavy construction — WFE tailwind.

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] Fab construction timelines hold (Arizona, Taylor, etc.)
- [ ] CHIPS Act funding flows
- [ ] Memory capacity expansion announcements
- [ ] WFE intensity continues rising with node complexity
- [ ] China continues domestic buildout despite restrictions

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Fab construction delays cascade
- [ ] AI capex pullback reduces urgency
- [ ] Memory overbuild leads to capex cuts
- [ ] WFE oversupply / pricing pressure
- [ ] China restrictions tighten further, reduce TAM

---

## Position sizing considerations

- ASML: premium valuation, monopoly, most defensive
- Lam/Applied: more cyclical, memory exposure
- KLA: yield-focused, benefits from complexity
- Consider basket approach — different exposures

## Price history

| Date | ASML (USD) | LRCX (USD) | AMAT (USD) | KLAC (USD) | Notes |
|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 2025-12 | | | | | |

**Hedge portfolio**: Short SMH, buy back WFE weights (ASML ~10%, AMAT ~5%, LRCX ~4%, KLAC ~3%). Isolates equipment capex cycle from chip demand cycle.
