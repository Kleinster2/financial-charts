## The thesis

Defense budgets are shifting from legacy platforms to AI-enabled systems. Autonomous drones, AI-powered intelligence, and software-defined warfare favor new entrants over legacy primes. Ukraine proving ground validates AI advantage.

> "Software is eating defense" — defense AI companies growing faster than legacy primes.

## Why defense AI

| Factor | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Ukraine validation** | AI drones, autonomous systems proven in combat |
| **Budget shift** | Pentagon pivoting from hardware to software |
| **Speed advantage** | AI decision loops faster than human |
| **Cost advantage** | $1K drone > $1M missile |
| **Talent flow** | Top AI engineers going to defense tech |

## Key players

| Company | Focus | Valuation | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| [[Anduril]] | Autonomous systems | ~$14B | Lattice platform, Fury drone |
| [[Palantir]] | AI/ML for defense | ~$150B | AIP platform, DOD contracts |
| [[Shield AI]] | Autonomous aircraft | ~$3B | V-BAT, Hivemind |
| [[Helsing]] | European defense AI | ~$5B | EU champion, German backing |

---

## Investment vehicles

| Category | Players | Access |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Public** | [[Palantir]] | PLTR — only large public pure-play |
| **Private** | [[Anduril]], [[Shield AI]], [[Helsing]] | Need secondary/pre-IPO access |
| **ETF exposure** | None | No defense AI ETF yet |

---

## Market dynamics

**Growing faster than legacy:**

| Company | Growth | Comparison |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Anduril | ~100% revenue CAGR | vs Lockheed ~3% |
| Palantir | ~30% revenue growth | vs Raytheon ~5% |
| Shield AI | Rapid contract wins | vs Boeing negative |

**Budget trends:**
- DOD Replicator initiative (autonomous systems)
- DARPA AI investments accelerating
- Ally nations (Japan, Australia, UK) following US lead

---

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] Anduril IPO (would create public pure-play)
- [ ] Major contract wins displacing primes
- [ ] Ukraine success stories continue
- [ ] DOD budget shift to software/AI accelerates
- [ ] More nations adopt autonomous systems

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Budget cuts to defense AI programs
- [ ] Legacy primes acquire AI capabilities
- [ ] Regulatory backlash on autonomous weapons
- [ ] Technology fails in combat conditions
- [ ] Talent exodus from defense tech

## Position sizing considerations

| Vehicle | Risk profile |
|---------|--------------|
| [[Palantir]] | Lower risk — public, diversified, profitable |
| [[Anduril]] | Medium risk — private, but strong contracts |
| [[Shield AI]] | Higher risk — earlier stage |
| [[Helsing]] | Higher risk — European, earlier stage |

---

## Geopolitical context

| Region | Driver |
|--------|--------|
| **Ukraine** | Proving ground for AI warfare |
| **Taiwan** | AI/autonomous systems for deterrence |
| **Middle East** | Drone warfare proliferation |
| **Europe** | NATO rearmament post-Ukraine |

---
