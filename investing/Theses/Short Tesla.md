# Short Tesla

**Core thesis:** Tesla trades at 100x+ P/E on declining fundamentals. The 4680 battery failure, missed FSD promises, and intensifying competition create asymmetric downside risk.

---

## Thesis summary

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Direction | Short |
| Timeframe | 12-18 months |
| Catalyst | Q1-Q2 2026 delivery misses, robotaxi delays |
| Key risk | FSD breakthrough or Musk narrative shift |

---

## Pillar 1: 4680 battery program failure

**The L&F contract collapse is the smoking gun.**

| Metric | Expectation | Reality |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| L&F contract | $2.9B | $7,386 (cancelled) |
| 4680 production | Industry standard | Only Cybertruck |
| Giga Texas utilization | 250K/year | 20-25K/year |
| $25K EV | 2024-2025 | No timeline |
| Range improvement | +54% | Not delivered |

**Why it matters:**
- Tesla's vertically-integrated battery strategy was core to cost leadership narrative
- Competitors (BYD, CATL) have scaled LFP/sodium-ion cheaper
- $25K EV now impossible without external cells (margin compression)

## Pillar 2: FSD perpetually "next year"

**Timeline of FSD promises:**

| Year | Promise | Delivered |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 2016 | Full autonomy "2 years" | No |
| 2019 | 1M robotaxis by 2020 | No |
| 2022 | FSD wide release | No |
| 2024 | Unsupervised 2025 | Partial (Austin only, safety drivers) |
| 2025 | Cybercab April 2026 | TBD |

**Current state (Jan 2026):**
- ~135 robotaxis in Austin (supervised)
- Unsupervised testing just started Dec 2025
- AI5 chip delayed to mid-2027
- Cybercab may launch on inferior AI4 hardware

**Bear view:** FSD has been promised for 9 years. Each delay erodes credibility. Waymo has actual unsupervised robotaxis operating today.

## Pillar 3: [[Automotive]] business declining

**2025: First annual delivery decline**

| Metric | 2025 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Deliveries | 1.64M | 1.79M | **-8.6%** |
| Q4 deliveries | 418K | 496K | **-16%** |

**US EV market contracting:**
- 2025: 1.5M units
- 2026 forecast: 1.1M units (-29%)
- Trump ended $7,500 tax credit

**Competition intensifying:**
- BYD passed Tesla as #1 globally (2025)
- Chinese EVs 30-50% cheaper
- Xiaomi SU7 profitable in 9 months
- European market slowing

---

## Pillar 4: Valuation disconnect

| Metric | Tesla | BYD | Legacy OEMs |
|--------|-------|-----|-------------|
| P/E | ~100x | ~20x | 5-10x |
| Revenue growth | Flat/declining | +30%+ | Flat |
| Deliveries | -8.6% YoY | +30%+ | Varies |

**What's priced in:**
- Successful robotaxi ($5T+ TAM)
- Energy business at scale
- Optimus commercialization
- Continued EV dominance

**What's happening:**
- Robotaxi perpetually delayed
- EV share declining
- 4680 program failed
- Competition widening

---

## Pillar 5: Musk distraction & political risk

**Musk's attention span:**
- Tesla (CEO)
- [[SpaceX]] (CEO)
- [[xAI]] (CEO)
- X/Twitter (owner)
- [[DOGE]] (government role)
- The [[Boring Company]]
- [[Neuralink]]

**Political polarization:**
- Boycotts from progressive consumers
- European regulatory scrutiny
- Brand damage measurable in delivery declines

---

## Pillar 6: FCF deficit & xAI capital drain (NEW)

**Evercore forecasts $5-7B cash burn in 2026:**

![[tsla-fcf-evercore.png]]
*FCF peaked at ~$8B in 2022, now projected to go deeply negative.*

| Metric | 2025 | 2026E | Swing |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Free cash flow | ~$6B | **-$5 to -$7B** | -$11-13B |
| Capex | ~$10B | **>$20B** | +$10B+ |

*Source: Bloomberg, Evercore ISI (Jan 2026)*

**Where the cash goes:**
- $2B committed to [[xAI]]
- Capex more than doubling (EV plants, batteries, robots, AI infra)
- Tesla selling Megapacks to xAI ($430M in 2024)

**The xAI entanglement:**
- xAI burning ~$1B/month (~$11B for 2025)
- X carrying ~$13B debt (interest = half of revenue)
- Merger speculation: Tesla/SpaceX/xAI combinations under discussion

**Ownership math:**

| Company | Musk stake |
|---------|------------|
| xAI | 51% |
| [[SpaceX]] | 42% |
| Tesla | **11%** |

A merger would increase Musk's combined stake. Tesla shareholders would be diluted while funding his AI ambitions.

**Bear thesis:** Tesla is becoming a piggy bank for Musk's AI empire while its core auto business declines

## Key risks to short

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| FSD breakthrough | Low | High |
| Robotaxi regulatory approval | Medium | High |
| Energy spinoff/rerating | Medium | Medium |
| Musk narrative pivot | Medium | Medium |
| Short squeeze | Medium | High |

**Mitigants:**
- Use options for defined risk
- Size position for volatility
- Monitor FSD progress closely

---

## Catalysts

**Near-term (Q1-Q2 2026):**
- Q1 delivery report (April)
- Cybercab production start (April target)
- FSD [[Europe]] supervised launch

**Medium-term:**
- AI5 chip delay confirmation
- Continued delivery declines
- Robotaxi regulatory setbacks

## How to play

| Approach | Instrument | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Direct short | Borrow TSLA | High conviction, unlimited risk |
| Put spreads | 6-month $350/$300 | Defined risk, lower cost |
| Pairs trade | Long BYD / Short TSLA | Sector-neutral exposure |
