# Long [[Japan]] [[Photoresists]]

**Status**: Active — structural chokepoint, EUV demand growing
**Created**: 2026-01-20

## The thesis

[[Japan]] controls ~90% of EUV photoresists — the light-sensitive chemicals that transfer circuit patterns onto silicon. No photoresist, no leading-edge chips. This is the "other chokepoint" alongside [[ASML]] equipment. As EUV adoption accelerates at 3nm/2nm nodes, photoresist demand grows 25%+ annually while supply remains concentrated in three Japanese companies.

**Primary vehicle**: [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] (4186.T) — the largest publicly traded pure-play after [[JSR Corporation]] went private.

---

## Why this is a chokepoint

### Concentration

| Company | EUV share | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | **Private** (JIC, 2024) |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | Public (4186.T) |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Public (diversified) |

**Top 3 [[Japan]] = ~90% of EUV photoresists.** No alternative suppliers at scale.

### Why it's hard to replicate

- **Tacit knowledge**: 30+ years of R&D, process know-how
- **Customer qualification**: 12-24 months to qualify new supplier
- **Chemistry complexity**: EUV resists must absorb 13.5nm wavelength light efficiently
- **Clean room expertise**: Sub-ppb contamination control
- **No shortcuts**: [[China]] has tried, limited progress

### [[Japan]] hasn't weaponized it — yet

2019 precedent: [[Japan]] restricted photoresists to Korea over wartime labor disputes. Brief [[Samsung]]/[[SK Hynix]] disruption. Demonstrated latent leverage.

## Demand drivers

### EUV adoption accelerating

| Node | EUV layers | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| 7nm | 5-10 | Production |
| 5nm | 10-15 | Production |
| 3nm | 20+ | Ramping |
| 2nm | 25-30+ | 2025-2026 |

More layers = more photoresist per wafer.

### High-NA EUV coming

- [[ASML]] shipping High-NA EUV tools (2024-2025)
- Requires new photoresist formulations
- Additional R&D moat for incumbents

### AI driving leading-edge demand

- Every AI chip ([[NVIDIA]] Blackwell, etc.) uses leading-edge nodes
- AI capex $300B+ annually from hyperscalers
- All flows through EUV lithography → photoresists

## The players

### Pure-play: Tokyo Ohka Kogyo (4186.T)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market cap | ~¥500B (~$3.3B) |
| Global share | ~20-25% |
| EUV growth target | +35% (2024) |
| Valuation | ~15-18x forward earnings |

**Why TOK:**
- JSR went private — TOK is the cleanest public pure-play
- Aggressive capacity expansion ([[Japan]] ¥200B+, Korea ¥20B)
- [[Intel]] partnership for sub-2nm development
- >50% revenue from electronic materials

### Diversified alternatives

| Company | Ticker | Photoresist exposure | Other businesses |
|---------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | 4063.T | ~10% of revenue | Wafers (35%), PVC (30%) |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | 4005.T | ~8% of revenue | Petrochemicals, pharma |
| [[Fujifilm]] | 4901.T | ~5% of revenue | [[Healthcare]] dominant |

### Non-[[Japan]] alternatives

| Company | Ticker | Share | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| [[Qnity]] | Q | ~7% | US pure-play, [[DuPont]] spin |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | MRK.DE | ~5% | [[Europe]], diversified |

Supply chain diversification value, but smaller scale.

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] EUV photoresist demand grows 20%+ annually
- [ ] TOK/JSR/Shin-Etsu maintain 85%+ combined share
- [ ] Leading-edge node adoption continues (3nm → 2nm → 1.4nm)
- [ ] High-NA EUV ramp creates new resist demand
- [ ] No meaningful [[China]] localization progress
- [ ] Capacity expansions come online (TOK [[Japan]] 2026, Korea 2030)

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Alternative lithography technology emerges (DSA, nanoimprint)
- [ ] [[China]] achieves meaningful photoresist production
- [ ] AI demand slowdown reduces leading-edge chip demand
- [ ] [[Japan]] weaponizes materials (could hurt or help depending on positioning)
- [ ] New entrant disrupts with metal-oxide resists at scale
- [ ] Memory-heavy demand mix (less EUV-intensive)

## [[Position sizing]] considerations

**Primary**: Tokyo Ohka Kogyo (4186.T)
- Pure-play, highest beta to thesis
- [[Japan]]-listed, yen exposure
- ~$3B market cap, decent liquidity

**Diversified**: Shin-Etsu (4063.T)
- Wafers + photoresists, double upstream exposure
- More liquid, larger cap (~$65B)
- PVC segment provides cyclical hedge

**US alternative**: Qnity (Q)
- USD-denominated
- Supply chain diversification angle
- Just spun off, potential volatility

**Basket approach**: TOK (50%) + Shin-Etsu (30%) + Qnity (20%)
- Diversifies [[Japan]]/currency risk
- Captures both pure-play and diversified angles

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Yen volatility | Hedge or accept; thesis is structural |
| Cyclicality | EUV less cyclical than commodity resists |
| Customer concentration | [[TSMC]]/[[Samsung]]/[[Intel]] all need resists |
| [[Japan]] geopolitics | Monitor [[China-Japan relations]] |
| Technology shift | Metal-oxide resists still early |

## Link to other theses

**[[Long WFE]]**: Complementary picks and shovels
- Equipment = US/Netherlands/[[Japan]]
- Materials = [[Japan]]-dominated
- Both benefit from fab buildout

**[[Long memory]]**: Different exposure
- Memory uses less EUV (more KrF/ArF)
- But [[HBM]] driving some leading-edge process

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Neutral
- Thesis is upstream of foundry competition
- Whoever wins needs photoresists
