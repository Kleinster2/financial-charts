## The thesis

Memory (DRAM/HBM/NAND) is entering a structural shortage driven by AI demand, constrained supply, and export controls. Korean memory makers ([[SK Hynix]], [[Samsung]]) have pricing power and margin expansion ahead.

---

## Demand drivers

### HBM for AI
- Every AI GPU needs HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)
- [[GPU memory scaling]]: V100 32GB → B200 192GB (6x in 8 years)
- [[NVIDIA]] H100/H200/Blackwell all require HBM3/HBM3e
- [[SK Hynix]] dominates HBM with 90%+ share
- HBM production cannibalizes DRAM wafer supply

### Hyperscaler buildout
- [[AI hyperscalers]] spending $620B on AI infrastructure in 2026 (up from $470B in 2025)
- [[Morgan Stanley]]: $2.9T cumulative AI datacenter spend by 2028
- Each GPU cluster needs massive memory
- Demand accelerating, not peaking

---

## Supply constraints

### Capacity limits
- DRAM fabs take 2-3 years to build
- Cleanroom constraints limit expansion
- HBM takes wafers from commodity DRAM

### Export controls
- U.S. revoked VEU status for [[Samsung]] and [[SK Hynix]] [[China]] fabs (Dec 2025)
- Now 1-year export approvals, no expansion allowed
- Caps [[China]] memory supply → tighter global market
- [[CXMT]] ([[China]]) limited by equipment access

### Consolidation
- Memory is oligopoly: Samsung, SK Hynix, [[Micron]]
- Rational competition → pricing discipline
- No new entrants at scale

## The players

| Company | Strength | HBM position |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | HBM leader, 90%+ share | Dominant |
| [[Samsung]] | Scale, DRAM/NAND breadth | #2 HBM, catching up |
| [[Micron]] | U.S.-based, [[CHIPS Act]] beneficiary | #3 HBM, improving |

---

## What validates the thesis

- [x] ~~Memory prices rise through 2025-2026~~ **DRAM +40% next quarter ([[TrendForce]])**
- [x] ~~HBM remains supply-constrained~~ **CY26 fully contracted**
- [x] ~~SK Hynix/Samsung margins expand~~ **SK Hynix [[GM]] 63-67%, exceeds [[TSMC]]**
- [x] ~~Export controls stay tight or tighten~~ **VEU revoked Dec 31**
- [x] ~~AI capex continues accelerating~~ **[[ByteDance]] $14B, hyperscaler buildout**
- [x] ~~No major new capacity comes online~~ **Only Micron ID1 in 2027**

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] AI demand slows (hyperscaler capex cuts)
- [ ] Memory overbuild (unlikely near-term)
- [ ] [[China]] finds equipment workarounds
- [ ] HBM alternative emerges
- [ ] Price war breaks out (irrational competition)

---

## [[Position sizing]] considerations

- Memory is cyclical — but this cycle has structural tailwinds
- SK Hynix: purest HBM play, premium valuation
- Samsung: memory + foundry, mixed narrative
- Micron: U.S.-based, [[CHIPS Act]] angle, #3 position

## Link to other theses

**[[Short TSMC long Korea]]**: Memory strength is part of the Korea bull case
- SK Hynix memory funds [[Advanced packaging]] bet
- Samsung memory margins fund foundry investment

**[[Long OSAT and test equipment]]**: More memory chips = more test capacity needed

## Price history

| Date | SK Hynix (KRW) | Samsung (KRW) | Micron (USD) | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 2025-12 | | | | |

**Hedge portfolio**: Short [[SMH]], buy back memory weight (MU ~5%). Isolates memory shortage thesis from broad semi beta.
