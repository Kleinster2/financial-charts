**Humanoid robotics inflection** — Cost curves crossing labor economics threshold. 2025-2027 marks transition from R&D to commercial deployment.

---

## Core thesis

Humanoid robot costs falling faster than expected (40% YoY vs. 15-20% projected). At $20-30K unit cost and 5-year lifespan, robots become competitive with human labor in specific industrial applications by 2027.

## The math

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target unit cost | $25,000 |
| Useful life | 5 years |
| Annual depreciation | $5,000 |
| Maintenance (est) | $2,000/year |
| Total annual cost | ~$7,000 |
| US manufacturing wage | ~$50,000/year |

At scale pricing, humanoids cost ~14% of human labor for repetitive tasks.

**But:** Robots work 24/7, no benefits, no turnover. Effective cost advantage even larger for multi-shift operations.

## Catalysts

1. **Tesla Optimus scale** — 50K units in 2026, 1M target by 2027
2. **Auto supply chain** — Hyundai's Boston Dynamics access to $100 parts vs. $1,000
3. **AI model integration** — LLMs enabling natural task learning
4. **China competition** — Unitree G1 at $13,500 sets floor

## Expressions

| Approach | Vehicles | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Direct exposure | [[Tesla]] (Optimus), [[Hyundai]] (Boston Dynamics) | Execution, timeline |
| Component suppliers | Actuator makers, vision systems | Lower beta |
| Picks & shovels | [[NVIDIA]] (compute), sensor cos | Diversified |

**Problem:** Pure-play humanoid robotics public equities are scarce. [[Figure AI]] is private ($39B valuation).

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Timeline slippage | Cost curve still declining |
| China pricing | May accelerate Western adoption pressure |
| Labor resistance | Political/regulatory friction |
| Use case limitations | Start with structured environments |

## Why now

- Goldman: 40% cost drop 2023→2024
- Bank of America: 51% reduction projected by 2030
- Tesla deploying Optimus in own factories (proving ground)
- Figure AI at $39B valuation signals VC conviction
