## The thesis

Nuclear power is the only scalable, baseload solution for AI data center demand. Hyperscalers signing nuclear PPAs validates the thesis. 44GW power gap can't be closed without nuclear.

> "The grid left them on read" — hyperscalers turning to nuclear because utilities can't deliver.

## Why nuclear for AI

| Factor | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Baseload** | AI training runs 24/7 — needs consistent power |
| **Density** | 1GW on small footprint vs sprawling solar farms |
| **Carbon-free** | Hyperscaler [[ESG]] commitments (2030 net-zero) |
| **Long-term PPAs** | Match 20+ year DC investment horizons |
| **Capacity factor** | 90%+ vs 25% solar, 35% wind |

## Investment vehicles

| Category | Players | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Utilities** | [[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]] | Existing fleet, PPAs signed |
| **SMR developers** | [[Oklo]], [[NuScale]] | Next-gen, high risk/reward |
| **[[Uranium]]** | [[Cameco]], [[Energy Fuels]] | Upstream fuel supply |
| **Materials** | [[EnergyX]], [[Centrus Energy]] | Li isotopes, HALEU |
| **Startups** | [[Fermi]] | Nuclear-powered DC (11GW target) |
| **Fusion** | [[Inertia Enterprises]], [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]], [[Helion Energy]] | ICF, tokamak, pulsed FRC |

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] More hyperscaler nuclear PPAs announced
- [ ] TMI restart proceeds on schedule
- [ ] SMR projects advance (Oklo, NuScale)
- [ ] [[Uranium]] prices rise on demand
- [ ] Nuclear mentioned in hyperscaler earnings

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Nuclear PPAs cancelled or delayed
- [ ] Regulatory pushback on co-location
- [ ] SMR technology fails to scale
- [ ] Renewables + storage become cheaper than nuclear
- [ ] Grid expansion solves power gap faster than expected

---

## [[Position sizing]] considerations

| Vehicle | Risk profile |
|---------|--------------|
| [[Constellation Energy]] | Lower risk — existing fleet, contracted PPAs |
| [[Vistra]] | Medium risk — Texas exposure, nuclear + gas |
| [[Oklo]] | High risk — pre-revenue SMR play |
| [[Cameco]] | Medium risk — uranium commodity exposure |
