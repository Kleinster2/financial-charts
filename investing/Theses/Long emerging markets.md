**Long emerging markets** — EM supercycle thesis. Weak dollar, diversification demand, commodity stockpiling, new frontiers opening.

---

## The thesis

[[Emerging markets]] have entered a yearslong supercycle:

| Driver | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Weak dollar | Present |
| Global growth | Benign |
| Diversification demand | Accelerating |
| Commodity stockpiling | New catalyst |
| New frontiers | Opening (Saudi, Venezuela) |

---

## Historical context

**Since 2010, EMs have not outperformed US for two consecutive years.**

2025 was stellar — but this pattern has held for 15 years. The thesis is that structural drivers are now different.

---

## 2025 performance

| Metric | Return |
|--------|--------|
| EM equity gauge | **+30%** (~2x S&P 500) |
| Bloomberg EM local-currency bonds | **+17%** |
| [[US dollar]] | Worst year since 2017 |

---

## Institutional backing: PIMCO

**Pramol Dhawan (PIMCO EM head):** "This is a playbook that will last for many years. We're not interested in taking chips off the table."

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PIMCO EM fund 2025 return | **22%** (better than 90% of peers) |
| AUM | $6.4B (highest since 2013) |
| Allocation | Local vs hard currency = **2:1** |

**PIMCO favorite bets:** Peru, South [[Africa]], Brazil, Turkey, Egypt (frontier), [[Nigeria]] (frontier)

**Thesis:** "Some of the best balance sheets are in select high-quality emerging markets. I can see a world where some EM yields trade inside DM."

**Fundamental shift:** Fiscal concerns rising in DM while EM showing discipline. Central bank independence questions now in US, not just EM.

## Catalyst 1: Commodity stockpiling

**Trump bellicosity → countries stockpile critical materials:**

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| [[Russia]]-Ukraine invasion | Central banks build gold reserves, diversify from [[Treasuries]] |
| Venezuela oil grab | Countries boost strategic inventories |
| [[Greenland]] "the hard way" | Accelerates resource security focus |

**Beneficiaries:**

| Country | Commodity link |
|---------|----------------|
| **Chile** | [[Copper]] (world's top producer) |
| **Brazil** | Industrial metals |
| **South [[Africa]]** | [[Gold]] |
| Indonesia | Nickel |
| DRC | Cobalt, copper |

**Pattern:** Chile's stock market closely tracks copper prices. Brazil tracks industrial metals. South [[Africa]] tracks gold.

## Catalyst 2: New frontiers opening

### Saudi Arabia market reforms (Jan 2026)

| Direct foreign investment | All foreigners can invest in main bourse (Feb 2026) |
| Property ownership | Foreigners can buy nationwide (except Mecca/Madinah) |
| [[MSCI]] EM status | Upgraded 2019 |
| YTD performance | Tadawul +3.8% |

**Inflow potential ([[HSBC]]):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current EM fund exposure | 60% |
| If 49% ownership limit removed | **$25B inflows** (most since 2019) |

### Venezuela debt restructuring

| Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Default | 2017 (US sanctions) |
| Current | Wall Street discussing restructuring |
| Post-Maduro | Regime change (Jan 2026) opens possibilities |

|---------|---------------------|
| **South Korea** | [[HBM]] (SK Hynix \#1, Samsung \#2) |
| [[Taiwan]] | Advanced logic ([[TSMC]]) |
| Malaysia | Backend packaging |
| Vietnam | Assembly |

**South Korea positioning:**
- SK Hynix = [[HBM]] industry leader
- Samsung = \#2 in [[HBM]]
- Kospi up **11.5% YTD**

---

## The opportunity set

**EM as "bazaar" with something for everyone:**

| Investor type | Opportunity |
|---------------|-------------|
| Supply chain specialists | Niche industrial firms ([[HBM]], packaging) |
| Commodity bulls | Unloved miners (Chile copper, Brazil iron) |
| Frontier seekers | Saudi reforms, Venezuela restructuring |
| AI plays | Korea (SK Hynix, Samsung) |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Dollar reversal | Watch Fed policy |
| [[China]] slowdown | Exposure varies by country |
| EM-specific crises | Diversify across regions |
| 15-year pattern | "This time is different" skepticism |
