## The thesis

[[Agent harnesses]] are the layer where competitive moats form in the AI stack. As models commoditize, the harness — the infrastructure that makes agents actually work — captures the value.

> "2025 was agents. 2026 is agent harnesses."

Harnesses are hard to build (Manus: 6 months, 5 rewrites; LangChain: 1 year, 4 architectures). You can't download them from Hugging Face. This is where differentiation lives.

## Why harnesses win

| Factor | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Model commoditization** | As models converge, the wrapper becomes the product |
| **Switching costs** | Developers build workflows around harnesses |
| **Network effects** | More users → more edge cases solved → better harness |
| **Time to production** | Harnesses ship in days, frameworks take weeks |
| **Reliability** | Battle-tested > build-your-own |

**Key insight:** Better models make harnesses *more* important, not less. They let you rip out yesterday's "smart logic" and upgrade.

## The competitive landscape

| Company | Product | Valuation | Edge |
|---------|---------|-----------|------|
| [[Anthropic]] | Claude Code, Agent SDK | Private | Best model + best harness integration |
| [[OpenAI]] | Codex | Private | GPT-5-Codex, 7+ hr autonomous runs |
| [[Anysphere]] | Cursor | $29.3B | Distribution, $1B ARR, developer love |
| Cognition | Devin + Windsurf | $4B | SWE-1.5 model, vertical integration |
| [[Meta]] | Manus | Acquired ~$2B | General-purpose, hyperscaler resources |
| [[Amazon]] | Q Developer | AWS | Enterprise distribution |
| Replit | Agent 3 | Private | 200 min autonomous, self-testing |
| [[Google]] | (building) | — | Windsurf team acqui-hire $2.4B |

**Pattern:** Every major AI lab now has a harness play. This is strategic, not optional.

## Investment vehicles

| Exposure | Vehicle | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Direct (private)** | [[Anthropic]] | Best positioned — model + harness + Claude Code |
| **Direct (public proxy)** | [[Alphabet]] | Google building harness, Windsurf team |
| **Direct (public proxy)** | [[Amazon]] | Q Developer, enterprise distribution |
| **Indirect** | [[NVIDIA]] | Inference demand from agents |
| **Indirect** | [[Microsoft]] | AutoGen framework, GitHub Copilot |

**Best pure-play:** Anthropic (if accessible via secondary)
**Best liquid proxy:** Cursor users → inference demand → NVIDIA

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] Harness revenue exceeds framework revenue
- [ ] Cursor maintains growth at $29B+ valuation
- [ ] More acqui-hires/acquisitions (Google/Windsurf pattern repeats)
- [ ] Enterprise adoption of harnesses accelerates
- [ ] Framework layer commoditizes (open source pressure)
- [x] Model providers launch harnesses (already happening)
- [x] Harness UX matters enough that users pay $200/mo extra to avoid official tools (OpenCode Black launch)

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Models get good enough that harnesses unnecessary
- [ ] Framework layer captures value instead
- [ ] Open source harnesses emerge and win
- [ ] Agent adoption stalls
- [ ] Hyperscalers bundle harnesses free with cloud

## Position sizing

High conviction = overweight

| Tier | Allocation | Vehicles |
|------|------------|----------|
| Core | Large | Anthropic (if accessible), NVIDIA |
| Supporting | Medium | Alphabet, Amazon |
| Speculative | Small | Cognition (if IPO), Replit (if IPO) |

---

## Link to other theses

**[[Long Anthropic]]**: Claude Code is a harness play. Model + harness vertical integration.

**[[Long inference stack]]**: Agents consume inference. More harnesses → more inference demand.

**[[Long NVIDIA]]**: Harness adoption drives GPU demand.

| 2026-01 | Meta acquires Manus ~$2B | Hyperscalers treating harnesses as strategic |
| 2025-12 | Google acqui-hires Windsurf team $2.4B | Scramble for harness talent |
| 2025-12 | Cursor hits $29B, $1B ARR | Harness category validated at scale |
| 2025-11 | Anysphere acquires Graphite | Harness consolidation beginning |
| 2025-09 | Replit Agent 3 — 200 min autonomous | Autonomous runtime extending |
| 2025-05 | OpenAI launches Codex | Every model provider needs a harness |
