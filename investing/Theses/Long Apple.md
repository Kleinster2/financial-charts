# Long Apple

**Status**: Active — silicon advantage compounding

## The thesis

Apple's silicon design team is a hidden asset. They extract more value from each TSMC node than competitors, creating a compounding advantage in cost, performance, and power efficiency.

---

## The silicon advantage

Apple's A-series and M-series chips consistently outperform at equivalent nodes because of:

1. **Co-design depth**: Years of TSMC optimization
2. **Vertical integration**: Hardware + software + silicon unified
3. **Design talent**: Best-in-class chip architects
4. **First access**: Priority on new TSMC nodes

**Evidence: A19 (Dec 2025)**
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node only gave 4% — rest from design optimization
- 2x cache density, layout efficiency gains
- Competitors on same node can't match this

---

## Why this matters for the stock

| Competitor | Their disadvantage |
|------------|-------------------|
| Qualcomm | Uses same TSMC nodes, worse design efficiency |
| Samsung (Exynos) | Samsung foundry + weaker design = double disadvantage |
| Google (Tensor) | Improving but years behind |
| Intel | Process struggles + design transition |

Apple's silicon lead translates to:
- **Better margins**: More efficient die = lower cost per chip
- **Better products**: Performance/watt leadership
- **Supply security**: TSMC prioritizes Apple

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] M-series continues taking Mac share from Intel
- [ ] A-series maintains 2+ year lead over Android
- [ ] Apple silicon expands to new categories (car, AR, home)
- [ ] Gross margins stable/expanding despite competition
- [ ] TSMC relationship stays exclusive

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Qualcomm/Google close the gap meaningfully
- [ ] Apple silicon team attrition (key designers leave)
- [ ] TSMC relationship weakens (capacity shared more broadly)
- [ ] M-series Mac transition disappoints
- [ ] iPhone volume declines offset silicon advantage

---

## Position sizing considerations

- Apple is already expensive on P/E
- Silicon advantage is "known" but magnitude may be underappreciated
- This is a quality compounder thesis, not a rerating thesis
- Consider: is the A19 evidence showing *acceleration* of the advantage?

## Price history

| Date | AAPL (USD) | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| 2025-12 | | |

**Hedge portfolio**: Short QQQ, buy back AAPL weight (~8%). Isolates Apple silicon advantage from large-cap tech beta.

## Evidence log

| Date | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-12-29 | A19 10% shrink from 4% node + 6% design | Design team extracting above-node gains |
| 2025-12-29 | Apple + NVIDIA lock TSMC 2nm capacity | Supply security advantage |

## Link to [[Long TSMC]]

These theses reinforce each other:
- Long TSMC: co-design moat is durable
- Long Apple: Apple is the prime beneficiary of that moat

The Apple-TSMC relationship is mutually reinforcing — both benefit from the other's excellence.
