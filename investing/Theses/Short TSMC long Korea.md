# Short TSMC / Long Korea

**Status**: Strengthening — multiple catalysts materializing

## The thesis

Taiwan's semiconductor dominance is structurally constrained while Korean players ([[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]]) have asymmetric upside from low expectations and geopolitical positioning.

---

## Long Korea

### Samsung (foundry)

| Catalyst | Status |
|----------|--------|
| AMD 2nm EPYC deal | Decision Jan 2026 |
| ~~Yields improve past 50%~~ | **55-60% achieved** ✓ |
| **xAI Taylor deal** | **Finalized Dec 2025** ✓ |
| NVIDIA second foundry | Exploring (post-Groq) |
| Google/Qualcomm deals | Rumored |
| Taylor ramp | Early 2026, full scale 2027 |
| Q4 2025 earnings | **30% above consensus** ✓ |

- Market expects failure → low bar for positive surprise
- Benefits from [[N-2 rule]] constraining TSMC overseas
- Benefits from TSMC capacity locked by Apple/NVIDIA
- **Yields now approaching TSMC levels (55-60% vs ~65%)**

### SK Hynix (memory + packaging)

| Catalyst | Status |
|----------|--------|
| HBM dominance continues | **On track** ✓ |
| HBM4 samples to NVIDIA | **Delivering 20-30K paid samples** ✓ |
| M15X fab early | **4 months ahead (Feb 2026)** ✓ |
| Indiana 2.5D packaging | 2028 target ($3.87B) |
| Turn-key wins (HBM + packaging) | Not yet |
| **Gross margins** | **63-67%** — first time exceeding TSMC since Q4 2018 ✓ |

- Attacking [[TSMC]]'s [[Advanced packaging]] moat
- Turn-key model could cut TSMC out of AI supply chain
- Memory leadership funds the packaging bet
- **Memory margins now HIGHER than TSMC** — extraordinary

## Short TSMC

| Headwind | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| [[N-2 rule]] | Can't do leading edge overseas |
| Capacity allocation | Locked by Apple/NVIDIA, others forced out |
| [[Taiwan concentration risk]] | Existential tail risk |
| High expectations | Priced for continued dominance |
| Packaging moat under attack | SK Hynix 2.5D |

- Not "TSMC is bad" — it's "expectations are high and threats are emerging"
- Any stumble (Arizona delays, yield issues, geopolitics) hits a full valuation

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] AMD signs with Samsung (Jan 2026)
- [x] ~~Samsung yields reach 60%+~~ **55-60% achieved Dec 2025**
- [ ] SK Hynix announces packaging customer
- [ ] TSMC Arizona delays or yield problems
- [ ] Taiwan tensions escalate
- [ ] TSMC loses a major customer
- [x] **xAI-Samsung deal finalized** (Dec 2025)
- [x] **Samsung Q4 beat** (30% above consensus)
- [x] **SK Hynix margins exceed TSMC** (63-67% GM)

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Samsung yields stay below 50% through 2026
- [ ] AMD deal falls through, no major customer wins
- [ ] SK Hynix packaging delayed past 2028
- [ ] TSMC relaxes capacity for AMD/Google (unlikely)
- [ ] Taiwan risk fades, stability returns
- [ ] Korean execution disappoints (again)

---

## Position sizing considerations

- This is a relative value trade, not outright directional
- Korea upside is option-like: low probability, high payoff
- TSMC short is fighting a dominant franchise — size small
- Consider expressing via options for asymmetry
