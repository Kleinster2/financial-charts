## The thesis

TSMC's moat is deeper than node leadership — it's accumulated co-design knowledge with top customers that compounds over time and can't be replicated.

---

## The co-design moat

Traditional view: TSMC leads on yields and nodes.

Deeper view: TSMC's best customers (Apple, NVIDIA) extract *more* value from each node than competitors because of years of co-optimization.

**Evidence: Apple A19 (Dec 2025)**
- 10% die shrink on N3P vs A18 on N3E
- Node only gave 4% — rest from design optimization
- Accumulated Apple-TSMC knowledge enabled gains beyond the node
- Competitors can't replicate this relationship

This isn't just "better yields" — it's a compounding advantage.

## Why the moat is durable

| Layer | Lock-in |
|-------|---------|
| [[Process design kit]] | Engineers learn TSMC-specific timing, quirks |
| EDA tools | Synopsys/Cadence calibrated to TSMC first |
| IP libraries | Arm validates on TSMC before others |
| Capacity | Best customers pre-book, squeezing others out |
| Co-design | Years of optimization accumulate |

Each layer reinforces the others.

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] Apple continues extracting above-node gains
- [ ] NVIDIA stays exclusive to TSMC for leading edge
- [ ] AMD/Google Samsung experiments disappoint
- [ ] Arizona ramp succeeds, reducing Taiwan risk discount
- [ ] Packaging (CoWoS) constraints ease

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Samsung yields reach 60%+ and win major customer
- [ ] Intel 18A succeeds and takes share
- [ ] Taiwan geopolitical risk materializes
- [ ] Key customer defects (Apple to Samsung — unlikely)
- [ ] Valuation gets too stretched

---

## Position sizing considerations

- TSMC is already a quality compounder — priced for excellence
- Upside comes from underappreciation of co-design moat depth
- Taiwan risk is real but may be overweighted in current price
- Not a "cheap" stock — thesis is about durability, not rerating

---

## Tension with [[Short TSMC long Korea]]

These aren't mutually exclusive:
- Long TSMC: moat is durable, quality compounder
- Short TSMC long Korea: relative value, Korea underpriced

Can hold both views — one is absolute, one is relative.

## Price history

| Date | TSM (USD) | 2330.TW (TWD) | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 2025-12 | | NT$1,530 | Record high on pricing news |

**Hedge portfolio**: Short SMH, buy back TSM weight (~10%). Isolates TSMC co-design moat from sector beta.

## Evidence log

| Date | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-12-29 | Apple A19 10% shrink from 4% node + 6% design | Co-design moat deeper than node alone |
| 2025-12-29 | Apple + NVIDIA lock 2nm capacity | Capacity moat intact |
| 2025-12-29 | TSMC ASP +133% since 2019 (15.2% CAGR) vs COGS +78% | Pricing power accelerating |
| 2025-12-29 | $1 COGS → $2.31 ASP post-2019 (was $1.43 pre-2019) | 3x incremental profit capture |
| 2025-12-29 | Rising COGS discourages competition, widens moat | Complexity benefits the leader |
| 2025-12-29 | Annual price hikes announced: +3-10% in 2026, continuing through 2029 | Monopolist pricing behavior, customers accept |
| 2025-12-29 | Stock hit record NT$1,530 on pricing news, foreign buying NT$9.27B | Market validates pricing power |
