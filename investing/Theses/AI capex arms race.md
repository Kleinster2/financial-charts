# AI Capex Arms Race

## The thesis

Frontier AI requires capital at unprecedented scale. The economics of training and inference are forcing consolidation, creative financing, and corporate restructuring across the industry. Winners will be those who can access cheap capital at scale; losers will be outspent.

> "There is insatiable demand right now for AI companies, even at the private level." — Joseph Alagna, Buttonwood Funds

## The numbers

### Lab spending

| Company | 2025 capex/burn | Future plans | Valuation |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| [[xAI]] | ~$11B burn | $18B+ DC buildout (old estimate) | $230B* |
| [[OpenAI]] | >$10B burn | **$1.4T+ infrastructure** | ~$300B |
| [[Anthropic]] | ~$4-5B | Aggressive training | ~$350B |
| [[Meta]] | $65B capex | **$135B capex 2026**, $600B US by 2028 | Public |

*Sources: Bloomberg, company disclosures (Jan 2026)*
**xAI valuation premium vs revenue growth — Anthropic outpacing xAI on top-line despite similar tier.*

### Hyperscaler capex

| Company | 2025 capex | 2026 guidance | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| [[Microsoft]] | ~$80B | Flat/up | Stock sold off Jan 29 on AI skepticism |
| [[Google]] | ~$75B | **$185B** | More than past 3 years combined |
| [[Amazon]] | ~$85B | **$200B** | Largest single-company outlay |
| [[Meta]] | ~$65B | **$135B** | 2x increase |

**Total Big Tech AI capex 2026E:** **$660B+** (FT, Feb 2026)

### Funding raised

| Lab | 12-month raises | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| [[OpenAI]] | ~$40B+ | Multiple rounds, Amazon talks |
| [[Anthropic]] | ~$30B+ | Google, Amazon backed |
| [[xAI]] | ~$40B | Equity + debt + SPV |
| **Combined** | **$100B+** | In 12 months |

---

## Why capital matters now

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Frontier model training** | $1B+ per training run becoming standard |
| **Inference scale** | Costs scale with users, not just training |
| **DC buildout** | 7-10 year grid waits, power constraints |
| **Talent** | $1M+ packages for top researchers |
| **Chip supply** | [[NVIDIA]] allocation still constrained |

**The brutal math:** xAI burns ~$1B/month. At $208M revenue (9M 2025), that's 50x+ burn-to-revenue ratio.

---

## Corporate restructuring response

### Musk empire convergence

**The case study:** Elon Musk's empire is restructuring around AI capital needs.

| Entity | Status | Musk stake |
|--------|--------|------------|
| [[xAI]] | Burning ~$1B/mo | 51% |
| [[Tesla]] | $44B cash, but facing FCF deficit | 11% |
| [[SpaceX]] | $1.5T IPO target, $50B raise | 42% |
| X (Twitter) | $13B debt, interest = 50% of revenue | ~80% |

**Options under discussion (Bloomberg, Jan 2026):**
- SpaceX IPO to fund space-based AI data centers
- xAI + SpaceX merger (capital infusion)
- xAI + Tesla merger (cash flow pooling)
- Full three-way combination

**Musk quote:** "My companies are, surprisingly in some ways, trending towards convergence."

**Pay package angle:** Tesla's $1T pay package milestones would adjust for merger. Bloomberg Intel notes SpaceX-xAI merger (without Tesla) may avoid distraction from hitting those targets.

**xAI's fundraising problem:** $230B valuation is premium to rivals. [[Anthropic]]'s revenue growth "far outpacing" xAI — makes standalone fundraising difficult without merger.

### Other restructuring

| Company | Action | Logic |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[OpenAI]] | Converting to for-profit | Remove nonprofit constraints on capital |
| [[Anthropic]] | Multi-cloud (AWS, Google, Azure) | Reduce dependency, maximize compute access |
| Big Tech | Off-balance-sheet SPVs | Keep debt metrics clean |

---

## Financing innovations

### Off-balance-sheet structures

**xAI's $20B SPV (Oct 2025):**

| Component | Party |
|-----------|-------|
| Lead equity | [[Valor Equity Partners]] |
| Debt | [[Apollo]] |
| Chips | [[NVIDIA]] (equity + supplier) |
| Lessee | xAI (5-year lease only) |

**How it works:** SPV buys chips with debt, leases to AI company. AI company's only obligation is lease — no balance sheet impact.

See [[AI infrastructure financing]].

### GPU financing

- Nvidia-backed investors fund chip purchases
- Hardware as collateral
- Sovereign wealth funds (Gulf) providing capital

---

## Market skepticism emerging

**Jan 29, 2026:** [[Microsoft]] had second-largest stock selloff in market history — skepticism on AI capex ROI.

**[[Oracle]]:** Down 50%+ from ATH on AI growth concerns.

**The question:** Will hundreds of billions in AI spending quickly pay off?

## Investment implications

### Winners

| Category | Logic | Names |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Chip suppliers** | Picks & shovels | [[NVIDIA]], [[Broadcom]], [[Marvell]] |
| **DC infrastructure** | Buildout regardless of winner | [[Vertiv]], [[Eaton]], [[Equinix]] |
| **Power** | Constraints = premium | [[Vistra]], nuclear names |
| **Capital providers** | Financing arms race | [[Apollo]], [[Blackstone]], [[Blue Owl]] |

### Losers

| Category | Logic | Names |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Undercapitalized labs** | Outspent | Smaller AI startups |
| **Pure auto exposure** | Capital diverted to AI | Legacy OEMs, [[Tesla]] (bear case) |
| **AI skeptics** | If thesis correct | Cash-heavy, capex-light tech |

### Complex bets

| Company | Bull case | Bear case |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [[Tesla]] | Robotaxi/Optimus if achieved | Cash drained by xAI, auto declining |
| [[Meta]] | $135B capex = AI leader | Overspending, ROI unclear |
| [[Microsoft]] | OpenAI partnership | Capex skepticism, selloff risk |

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] More corporate restructurings (mergers, spinoffs)
- [ ] Capex guidance increases continue
- [ ] Financing innovations spread
- [ ] Power/DC constraints persist
- [ ] Lab consolidation (smaller players acquired/fail)

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] AI capex cycle peaks/reverses
- [ ] Efficiency breakthroughs reduce compute needs
- [ ] Investor revolt forces spending cuts
- [ ] Model improvements plateau (less need for scale)
- [ ] Regulatory intervention caps spending
