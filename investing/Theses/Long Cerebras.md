## The thesis

[[Cerebras]] is the last independent SRAM inference player after NVIDIA licensed [[Groq]] and [[Intel]] acquired [[SambaNova]]. Strategic scarcity creates acquisition premium or IPO opportunity.

> "Cerebras is now in a very interesting and highly strategic position as the last independent SRAM player that was ahead of Groq on all public benchmarks." — Gavin Baker

## Why "last independent" matters

After December 2025:

| SRAM player | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| [[Groq]] | NVIDIA partner (licensed) |
| [[SambaNova]] | [[Intel]] acquired |
| Cerebras | **Independent** |

Cerebras is the only remaining option for:
- Hyperscalers wanting SRAM without NVIDIA
- Sovereign AI avoiding US platform lock-in
- Acquirers needing decode capability

---

## Why Cerebras wasn't Groq'd

| Factor | Groq | Cerebras |
|--------|------|----------|
| Architecture | Many-chip rack | Wafer-scale (WSE) |
| NVLink fit | Easy integration | Harder — needs own rack |
| Benchmarks | Strong | Ahead of Groq (public) |

Cerebras's wafer-scale approach makes NVIDIA integration harder — which may preserve independence value.

---

## Strategic options

1. **IPO** — Already filed (Sep 2024). Public market access.
2. **Hyperscaler acquisition** — [[Google]], [[Amazon]], [[Microsoft]] need decode.
3. **NVIDIA deal** — Similar to Groq licensing.
4. **Sovereign AI focus** — G42 relationship, geopolitics.

Any of these creates value realization.

---

## The G42 angle

Cerebras's largest customer is [[G42]] (UAE):
- Condor Galaxy supercomputer
- Sovereign AI positioning
- Non-US, non-[[China]] option

**Risk**: Customer concentration
**Opportunity**: Sovereign AI is growing market

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] IPO prices at premium to private valuation
- [ ] Acquisition offer from hyperscaler
- [ ] NVIDIA licensing deal (Groq-style)
- [ ] G42 expands relationship
- [ ] [[Benchmark]] leadership maintained

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Rubin SRAM outperforms significantly
- [ ] G42 concentration becomes liability
- [ ] IPO fails or prices poorly
- [ ] Wafer-scale yields disappoint
- [ ] No acquirer interest materializes

---

## [[Position sizing]] considerations

- Private (IPO filed) — limited access
- Speculative — strategic optionality bet
- Small position until liquidity event
- Watch IPO pricing closely

---

## The bear case

| Risk | Severity |
|------|----------|
| NVIDIA Rubin SRAM competes directly | High |
| Customer concentration (G42) | High |
| Integration difficulty limits partnerships | Medium |
| High system costs ($2-[[3M]]+) | Medium |
| Unproven at hyperscale | Medium |

---

## Link to other theses

**[[Long NVIDIA]]**: Cerebras is the "what if you don't want NVIDIA" option. Both can win.

**[[Short standalone ASICs]]**: Cerebras survives consolidation because of unique wafer-scale niche.

| 2025-12 | [[Intel]] acquires SambaNova | Consolidation accelerating |
| 2025-12 | Gavin Baker: "strategic position" | Smart money notices |
| 2024-09 | IPO filed | Liquidity event approaching |
