# Ellison AI-IP vertical integration

**Core thesis:** The Ellison family is assembling both sides of the AI-content stack — [[Larry Ellison]] builds the AI cloud infrastructure ([[Oracle]] + [[TikTok]] partnership), while [[David Ellison]] hoards the IP (Paramount acquired, [[Warner Bros Discovery]] hostile bid). When AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from studio output, the family that controls both the compute layer and the IP vault wins.

## The pieces

### 1. Oracle → TikTok: infrastructure + distribution

[[Oracle]] became [[TikTok]]'s "trusted technology partner" in the Jan 2026 US restructuring deal:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Oracle equity stake | **~15%** of TikTok USDS JV |
| Role | Data custodian, algorithm replication, security partner |
| US user data | **170M+ Americans** hosted on OCI |
| [[ByteDance]] retained stake | 19.9% |
| US investor ownership | 80.1% total |

Oracle doesn't just host data — it controls algorithm replication and retraining under US jurisdiction. The same [[ByteDance]] whose [[Seedance]] 2.0 pirates American IP now runs on Oracle infrastructure.

### 2. David Ellison: IP consolidation

**Paramount (closed):**
- [[Skydance Media]] merged with [[Paramount Global]] (announced Jul 2024, closing 2025-26)
- Assets: CBS, Paramount Pictures, Paramount+, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime
- IP library: Top Gun, Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, Transformers, Indiana Jones, SpongeBob

**Warner Bros Discovery (hostile bid, live):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Offer | **$30/share all-cash** |
| Enterprise value | **~$108.4B** |
| Equity financing | $43.6B (Larry Ellison personal guarantee + [[Gerry Cardinale\|RedBird Capital]]) |
| Debt financing | ~$54B ([[Bank of America]], [[Citigroup]], [[Apollo]]) |
| Sovereign wealth | Saudi, Qatari, Abu Dhabi funds |
| Competing bid | [[Netflix]] at $27.75/share (studios + HBO only) |
| Status | WBD board reviewing; activist [[Ancora Alternatives\|Ancora]] pushing engagement |
| Sweetener | +25¢/share/quarter ticking fee if not closed by Dec 31, 2026 |

WBD IP library: HBO, DC Universe (Batman, Superman), Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, CNN, Discovery networks.

**If both deals close**, David Ellison controls arguably the deepest IP vault in entertainment — rivaling only [[Disney]].

### 3. Oracle AI cloud: the compute layer

| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| FY2026 revenue guidance | **$67B** | Jun 2025 - May 2026 |
| FY2026 capex forecast | **~$50B** | Phillip Securities est. |
| Q2 FY2026 revenue | $16.1B | +13% YoY |
| RPO backlog | **$130B** (Q3 FY2025) → growing | +63% YoY |
| Cloud RPO growth | **90%+** | |
| Q2 FY2026 capex | $12B/quarter run rate | |
| Key AI clients | [[OpenAI]], [[Meta]], [[NVIDIA]], [[xAI]], [[TikTok]] | |

Oracle is building capacity at hyperscaler pace. [[Project Stargate]] partnership ($500B AI infra JV with [[SoftBank]], [[OpenAI]], [[MGX]]) further cements the position.

## The Seedance catalyst

[[Seedance]] 2.0 (Feb 10, 2026) proved the thesis timeline is compressing:

| Event | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Seedance 2.0 launch | Feb 10, 2026 | Hollywood-quality video from 2-line prompts |
| Viral Tom Cruise/Brad Pitt fight | Feb 11 | Deadpool writer Rhett Reese: "It's likely over for us" |
| [[Disney]] cease-and-desist | Feb 13 | Called it a "virtual smash-and-grab" of Disney IP |
| [[Paramount Global\|Paramount]] cease-and-desist | Feb 14 | |
| [[SAG-AFTRA]] condemnation | Feb 13 | "Unacceptable... undercuts human talent" |
| [[MPA]] statement | Feb 13 | Called it "massive scale" unauthorized use |

The irony: [[ByteDance]]'s Seedance pirates the very IP that the Ellison family is acquiring. And ByteDance's US operations run on [[Oracle]]'s cloud.

## The vertical integration thesis

```
Layer 4: DISTRIBUTION    → TikTok (Oracle infrastructure, 170M US users)
Layer 3: GENERATION      → AI models running on Oracle Cloud (OCI)
Layer 2: INFRASTRUCTURE  → Oracle AI cloud ($50B capex, Stargate)
Layer 1: IP LIBRARY      → Paramount + WBD(?) (Ellison vault)
```

**The flywheel:**
1. AI generates content on Oracle's cloud
2. That content draws from IP sitting in the Ellison vault
3. TikTok distributes it on Oracle's infrastructure
4. Revenue flows back through entities the Ellisons own or control

**Father builds the infrastructure. Son hoards the IP. Same family, both sides of the stack.**

## Key risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| WBD bid fails | High | Netflix competing at $27.75; WBD board currently favors Netflix |
| Antitrust blocks WBD | High | DOJ review ongoing; Senate hearing held Feb 3 |
| AI copyright law evolves | Medium | Courts may enforce IP protection against AI generation |
| Oracle cloud execution | Medium | Still #4 behind AWS/Azure/GCP |
| IP licensing fights | Medium | Studios may successfully block AI use of their content |
| ByteDance decoupling | Low-Medium | TikTok JV may limit ByteDance algorithm access |
| Larry Ellison age (80) | Low | Succession/continuity risk |

## What to watch

- **WBD shareholder vote** — Ancora and other activists pushing for Paramount engagement
- **DOJ antitrust decisions** on both Netflix-WBD and potential Paramount-WBD
- **AI copyright litigation** — Disney/Paramount cease-and-desists may become lawsuits
- **Oracle Q3 FY2026 earnings** (Mar 2026) — OCI growth trajectory
- **TikTok JV operational details** — how much control Oracle actually exercises
- **Sovereign wealth fund involvement** — Saudi/Qatari/Abu Dhabi capital signals geopolitical alignment

## Investment exposure

| Ticker | Exposure | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **ORCL** | Direct | AI cloud + TikTok infrastructure |
| **WBD** | Contingent | Only if Paramount bid succeeds (~$30 target) |
| **PARA** | Direct | Already Ellison-controlled |
| **NFLX** | Inverse | Wins if Netflix-WBD closes instead |
| **DIS** | Indirect | IP competitor; Seedance copyright plaintiff |
