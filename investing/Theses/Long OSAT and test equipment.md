## The thesis

AI chip supply chain has multiple bottlenecks. Instead of picking foundry winners (TSMC vs Samsung vs Intel), bet on the constrained infrastructure everyone needs: packaging and final test.

---

## Why this works

| Foundry bet | OSAT/Test bet |
|-------------|---------------|
| Binary — pick winner | Foundry-agnostic |
| Competitive dynamics | Capacity constrained |
| Margin pressure from competition | Pricing power from scarcity |
| Geopolitical risk | Less exposed |

Whoever wins foundry, chips still need packaging and testing.

---

## Long ASE

[[ASE]] — #1 OSAT globally

| Catalyst | Status |
|----------|--------|
| AI/HPC revenue doubling | On track |
| Capex +$1B for capacity | 2025 |
| [[Advanced packaging]] demand | Growing |
| [[Final test bottleneck]] | Emerging |

**Why it works:**
- Foundry-agnostic — packages chips from TSMC, Samsung, Intel
- Bottleneck positioning = pricing power
- Every AI accelerator needs packaging + test

---

## Long Cohu

[[Cohu]] — Test handler equipment

| Catalyst | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Eclipse platform wins | Positioning for AI |
| Thermal constraints headline | Not yet mainstream |
| Equipment refresh cycle | Each AI generation |

**Why it works:**
- Pure play on [[Final test bottleneck]]
- Larger/hotter packages → legacy equipment can't cope
- Small cap = higher beta, more upside if thesis plays out

---

## The bottleneck logic

```
Foundry:     Competitive, multiple players, margin pressure
Packaging:   Constrained (TSMC CoWoS full, ASE expanding)
Final Test:  Constrained (thermal limits, equipment refresh)
```

Bottlenecks have pricing power. Competitive segments don't.

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] ASE reports pricing power in earnings
- [ ] Cohu Eclipse wins at major OSATs
- [ ] Test/packaging constraints cited in NVIDIA/AMD earnings
- [ ] AI chip lead times extend due to back-end
- [ ] ASE/Cohu margins expand

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] Packaging/test capacity catches up to demand
- [ ] Foundries (TSMC) pull back-end in-house
- [ ] AI demand slows, bottlenecks ease
- [ ] Competition erodes ASE/Cohu pricing
- [ ] Cyclical downturn hits equipment hard

---

## Position sizing considerations

- ASE = larger, more liquid, lower beta
- Cohu = smaller, higher beta, more volatile
- Consider basket (both) to diversify single-stock risk
- Cohu is cyclical — size for volatility
- Less geopolitically exposed than foundry plays

---

## Price history

| Date | ASE (USD) | Cohu (USD) | Notes |
|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 2025-12 | | | |

**Hedge portfolio**: Short SMH (ASE/Cohu not in index — no buyback needed). Isolates back-end bottleneck thesis from front-end semi beta.

## Evidence log

| Date | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-12-29 | Final test emerging as AI bottleneck (SemiAnalysis) | Validates thesis |
| 2025-12-29 | ASE +$1B capex for AI/HPC | Validates demand signal |
| 2025-12-29 | Cohu Eclipse selected for extreme thermal AI | Validates product positioning |

## Relationship to other theses

| Thesis | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Complementary — different angle on same trend |
| Foundry winners | Alternative — avoids picking winners |

Can hold both theses simultaneously. They're not mutually exclusive.
