# Chinese EVs enter US

**Core thesis:** Chinese EV makers will enter the US market within 3-5 years despite 100% tariffs. The pathways are JVs with legacy OEMs, existing Western brands (Volvo/Polestar), or Mexico manufacturing. This restructures the US auto industry.

## Thesis summary

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Direction | Long Chinese EV exposure to US, short unpartnered legacy OEMs |
| Timeframe | 3-5 years |
| Catalyst | First major JV announcement or Geely US entry |
| Key risk | Congressional block, national security legislation |

## Why Chinese EVs will enter

**The cost gap is unbridgeable without tech transfer:**

| Metric | Chinese EVs | US EVs |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Average price | $30-40K | $50-60K |
| Manufacturing cost | 30-50% lower | Baseline |
| Time to profitability | 9-18 months (Xiaomi) | Years (Tesla took decade) |
| Battery cost | Integrated (BYD, CATL) | Purchased |

**Legacy OEM desperation:**
- [[Ford]] CEO Farley: Chinese EVs are "existential threat"
- Ford discontinued Escape, Edge — nothing until 2027
- GM, Stellantis facing same cost pressure
- Extended-range pivot = admission pure EV strategy failed

## Entry pathways

### 1. JV with US OEMs (most likely near-term)

**Ford-Xiaomi/BYD talks (Jan 2026):**
- US manufacturing joint venture structure
- Ford provides factory, dealer network, political cover
- Chinese partner provides tech, cost structure
- Ford denied; FT has 4 sources

**Why it works:**
- Bypasses 100% import tariff
- "Made in America" political narrative
- Legacy OEM gets survival path
- Chinese OEM gets market access

### 2. Existing Western brands (Trojan horse)

**[[Geely]] owns:**
- [[Volvo Cars]] — US factory in South Carolina
- [[Polestar]] — Already selling in US
- Lotus — Luxury sports positioning

Geely signaling US entry "within 3 years." Could route Chinese EV tech through Swedish/British brands.

### 3. Mexico manufacturing

**USMCA loophole:**
- Build in Mexico, export to US tariff-free
- BYD, other Chinese OEMs exploring Mexico plants
- Risk: Congress could close loophole

### 4. Direct entry (requires policy shift)

**Trump's openness:**
> "If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that."
> — Trump at Ford Dearborn, Jan 2026

Could negotiate direct entry as part of broader China trade deal (April 2026 visit).

## Political dynamics

**Pro-entry forces:**
- Trump dealmaking instincts
- Legacy OEM lobbying (survival)
- Consumer demand for affordable EVs
- Manufacturing job creation narrative

**Anti-entry forces:**
- House China Committee (Moolenaar)
- National security hawks
- UAW (if Chinese plants non-union)
- Pentagon (Xiaomi military list history)

**Prediction:** First JV announcement triggers massive political fight. Outcome depends on whether Trump prioritizes dealmaking or listens to hawks.

## Investment implications

**Long:**
- [[Xiaomi]] — Ford JV talks, SU7 quality proven
- [[BYD]] — Scale, vertical integration, Ford talks
- [[Geely]] — Volvo/Polestar infrastructure already in US
- US suppliers who would serve Chinese plants

**Short/Avoid:**
- Legacy OEMs without China partnerships
- Pure-play US EV startups (Rivian, Lucid) — squeezed from both ends

**Pairs trade:**
- Long BYD / Short unpartnered legacy OEM

---

## Domino effect risk

Former US official warning: Ford JV would create "domino effect" forcing other US automakers into "forced marriage" with Beijing.

If Ford partners with Xiaomi:
- GM must respond (partner with BYD? Geely?)
- Stellantis must respond
- Japanese OEMs face same pressure

**Endgame:** US auto industry becomes joint venture ecosystem with Chinese tech, similar to 1980s Japanese transplants.

## Key risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Congressional legislation blocking JVs | Medium | High |
| National security review kills deals | Medium | High |
| Trump policy reversal | Low | High |
| Chinese OEMs decide US not worth hassle | Low | Medium |
| Mexico loophole closed | Medium | Medium |
