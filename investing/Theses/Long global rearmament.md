**Long global rearmament** — Structural defense spending upcycle driven by great power competition, Ukraine war, and stockpile depletion. Multi-year tailwind across primes, munitions, and supply chain.

---

## The thesis

Global defense spending entering structural upcycle:

| Metric | 2024 | 2040 (S&P est) |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Global spending | ~$2.5T | **$6T** |
| Growth | — | +140% |

**Drivers:**
- Great power competition (US-China, Russia-NATO)
- Ukraine war exposed stockpile gaps
- Taiwan contingency planning
- Middle East instability
- Technology arms race (AI, hypersonics, space)

This is not cyclical — it's structural realignment after 30 years of post-Cold War peace dividend.

## Regional breakdown

### United States

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 | ~$895B |
| FY27 proposed | **$1.5T** (+68%) |
| Programs | Golden Dome, NGAD, B-21, hypersonics |

See [[Trump defense budget]], [[US Defense Industry]].

### Europe

| Country | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Germany | Historic €100B fund, 2%+ GDP |
| Poland | 4%+ GDP (NATO leader) |
| UK | 2.5% target |
| EU | 3M shells/year target |

See [[European defense spending]], [[European Defense Industry]].

### Asia-Pacific

| Country | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Japan | 1% → 2% GDP (constitutional shift) |
| South Korea | Export boom (Poland, etc.) |
| Australia | AUKUS submarines |
| Taiwan | Asymmetric buildup |

## Investment vectors

### 1. US Primes

Traditional beneficiaries of budget growth:

| Company | Ticker | Key catalyst |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | LMT | F-35, Golden Dome |
| [[RTX]] | RTX | Missiles, engines, Patriot |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | NOC | B-21, Sentinel ICBM |
| [[General Dynamics]] | GD | Submarines, vehicles |
| [[L3Harris]] | LHX | Comms, EW |

### 2. European rearmament

Rheinmetall = most direct play:

| Company | Ticker | Catalyst |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Rheinmetall | RHM.DE | Munitions, vehicles, air defense |
| [[BAE Systems]] | BA.L | UK champion |
| Thales | HO.PA | Electronics |
| Saab | SAAB-B.ST | Gripen, submarines |

### 3. Export winners

Korea and Israel benefiting from global demand:

| Company | Ticker | Edge |
|---------|--------|------|
| Hanwha Aerospace | 012450.KS | K9 howitzer, Poland deal |
| Korea Aerospace | 047810.KS | FA-50, KF-21 |
| Elbit Systems | ESLT | Drones, EW, global |

See [[Korean Defense Industry]], [[Israeli Defense Industry]].

### 4. Defense disruptors

Software-defined warfare:

| Company | Ticker | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Anduril]] | Private | Autonomous systems |
| [[Palantir]] | PLTR | AI analytics |
| Kratos | KTOS | Drones, hypersonics |

See [[Long defense AI]].

### 5. Munitions & supply chain

Stockpile replenishment = years of demand:

| Company | Ticker | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Rheinmetall | RHM.DE | Artillery shells |
| General Dynamics | GD | Ammunition |
| Olin | OLN | Small arms ammo |

**Materials:**
- [[Copper]] — 0.5kg per 155mm shell, 2nd highest material in defense
- Rare earths — guidance, motors
- Titanium — airframes
- Tungsten — armor-piercing

## Key catalysts

| Catalyst | Timing | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Trump $1.5T budget | FY27 | US primes |
| EU munitions ramp | 2024-2030 | Rheinmetall |
| Japan 2% GDP | 2027 | MHI, domestic |
| Poland deliveries | 2024-2030 | Korean exporters |
| Golden Dome | 2025+ | Missile defense |
| Ukraine resupply | Ongoing | Munitions |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Peace breakthrough | Unlikely given structural tensions |
| Budget politics | Bipartisan support for defense |
| Program delays | Diversify across programs |
| Valuation | Defense at reasonable multiples |
| Execution | Stick to quality operators |

---

## Valuation

Defense stocks remain reasonably valued:

| Metric | US Primes | Palantir (exception) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| P/E | 15-20x | 100x+ |
| FCF yield | 5-7% | Lower |
| Dividend | 1-2% | None |

Not pricing in structural spending increase.

---

## Position sizing

| Conviction | Allocation |
|------------|------------|
| Core | US primes (LMT, NOC, RTX) |
| Tactical | European (Rheinmetall) |
| Speculative | Korean exporters, disruptors |
| Materials | Copper miners (FCX, SCCO) |
