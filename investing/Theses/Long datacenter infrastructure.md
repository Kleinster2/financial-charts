# Long Datacenter Infrastructure

## The thesis

AI infrastructure buildout requires massive datacenter expansion. Hyperscalers can't build fast enough — creating opportunities for [[REITs]], developers, and financiers. Power constraints make existing capacity more valuable.

> "Data center spending exceeds oil exploration for the first time" — [[IEA]] World Energy Outlook 2025

## The math

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **DC spending 2025** | $580B | [[IEA]] |
| **US power needed 2025-28** | 69 GW | [[Morgan Stanley]] |
| **Power gap** | 44 GW | [[Morgan Stanley]] |
| **[[Hyperscaler capex]] 2025** | $250B+ | Company guidance |

---

## Investment vehicles

| Category | Players | Access |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Public [[REITs]]** | [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]] | EQIX, DLR |
| **Private platforms** | [[QTS]] ([[Blackstone]]), CyrusOne ([[KKR]]) | Via parent |
| **Financiers** | [[Blue Owl]], [[Blackstone]] | OWL, BX |
| **Builders** | [[Modine Manufacturing]], [[Vertiv]] | MOD, VRT |

---

## Why the opportunity

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Supply constrained** | 7-10 year grid connection waits in key markets |
| **Power scarcity** | Existing capacity becomes more valuable |
| **Hyperscaler demand** | Locked-in long-term contracts |
| **Alternative financing** | Blue Owl $27B [[Meta]] deal sets precedent |
| **Geographic shift** | Power-constrained markets → new hubs |

## REIT comparison

| REIT | Focus | Market cap | Edge |
|------|-------|------------|------|
| [[Equinix]] | Interconnection | ~$80B | Network density moat |
| [[Digital Realty]] | Hyperscale | ~$50B | Wholesale scale |
| [[Coresite]] (AMT) | Colocation | Subsidiary | Cloud on-ramps |

---

## Alternative exposure

| Vehicle | Approach | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | Own/operate ([[QTS]]) | $1T+ AUM, deal flow |
| [[Blue Owl]] | Finance (JVs) | [[Meta]] $27B deal, lower risk |
| [[Brookfield]] | Infrastructure | Global diversified |
| [[DigitalBridge]] | Digital infra | Pure-play digital |

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] DC [[REITs]] report strong leasing
- [ ] Power PPA announcements accelerate
- [ ] [[Hyperscaler capex]] guidance increases
- [ ] Grid delays extend (validates scarcity)
- [ ] Financing deals multiply

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] AI capex cycle slows
- [ ] Hyperscalers build in-house
- [ ] Interest rates spike (REIT pressure)
- [ ] Oversupply in key markets
- [ ] Power constraints ease faster than expected

## Geographic winners

| Hub | Advantage | Players |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Northern Virginia | Established, but constrained | Equinix, Digital Realty |
| [[Columbus Ohio]] | Cheap AEP power | Growing |
| Phoenix | Solar abundant | [[TSMC]] adjacent |
| Dallas | ERCOT flexibility | Expanding |
| Nordics | Hydro, cooling | [[Nebius]], [[Google]] |
