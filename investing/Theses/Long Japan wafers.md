# Long Japan Wafers

**Status**: Active — AI driving wafer demand, Japan duopoly
**Created**: 2026-01-20
**Last reviewed**: 2026-01-20

## The thesis

Japan controls ~55% of global silicon wafers through [[Shin-Etsu]] and [[Sumco]]. Every chip starts as a wafer — this is the most upstream chokepoint in semiconductors. AI chips use larger dies and more advanced packaging, driving wafer area demand. The duopoly has pricing power in a structurally tight market.

**Primary vehicle**: [[Sumco]] (3436.T) — pure-play wafer exposure
**Diversified alternative**: [[Shin-Etsu]] (4063.T) — wafers + photoresists + PVC hedge

---

## Why wafers matter

Every semiconductor starts as a silicon wafer:
- **Logic chips**: Cut from 300mm wafers
- **Memory**: Same 300mm wafers
- **Analog/automotive**: 200mm wafers
- **AI chips**: Larger dies = more wafer area per chip

No wafers = no chips. Period.

## Market structure

| Company | Share | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~30% | 4063.T | Diversified (PVC, photoresists) |
| [[Sumco]] | ~25% | 3436.T | **Pure-play** |
| [[Siltronic]] | ~13% | WAF.DE | European, GlobalWafers bid blocked |
| SK Siltron | ~12% | — | SK Group subsidiary |
| Others | ~20% | — | Fragmented |

**Japan duopoly:** Shin-Etsu + Sumco = 55% of global supply.

**Top 4 = 80%** — highly concentrated oligopoly.

## Demand drivers

### AI chips consume more wafer area

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Larger dies** | NVIDIA H100 = 814mm², B200 = 2x reticle |
| **Lower yields** | Leading-edge = fewer good dies per wafer |
| **HBM stacking** | Memory dies consume wafer area |
| **Advanced packaging** | Interposers, CoWoS use silicon |

**Siltronic data (2025):**
- Datacenter = 15% of wafer consumption but **50% of incremental demand**
- Servers +23% YoY
- Total wafer consumption +8% in 2025

### Fab buildout wave

Every new fab needs wafer supply:
- TSMC Arizona (2 fabs)
- Intel Ohio (2 fabs)
- Samsung Taylor
- Rapidus Japan
- TSMC Kumamoto

**Lead time:** Wafer capacity takes 2-3 years to build.

### Supply constraints

- Wafer fabs are capital-intensive
- Limited new capacity coming online
- China lacks advanced wafer capability
- Duopoly has pricing discipline

## Pure-play vs diversified

| Metric | Sumco | Shin-Etsu |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Wafer exposure | 100% | ~35% |
| Photoresists | No | Yes (~10%) |
| PVC/chemicals | No | Yes (~30%) |
| Cyclicality | Higher | Lower (hedged) |
| Beta to thesis | Higher | Lower |
| Market cap | ~$5B | ~$65B |

**Sumco**: Maximum leverage to wafer thesis, more volatile
**Shin-Etsu**: Diversified, also captures photoresist thesis, less volatile

---

## What validates the thesis

- [ ] Wafer prices remain firm or rise
- [ ] AI chip demand continues (larger dies, more wafers)
- [ ] Fab buildout proceeds (TSMC, Intel, Samsung capex)
- [ ] No major new wafer capacity from China
- [ ] Japan maintains 50%+ share
- [ ] HBM growth drives memory wafer demand

---

## What invalidates the thesis

- [ ] AI demand slowdown (hyperscaler capex cuts)
- [ ] Wafer oversupply (unlikely near-term)
- [ ] China achieves wafer self-sufficiency
- [ ] Chiplet/advanced packaging reduces wafer intensity
- [ ] Price war between Shin-Etsu and Sumco (irrational)
- [ ] Alternative substrate technology emerges

---

## Position sizing considerations

**Pure-play (higher conviction):**
- Sumco (3436.T) — 100% wafer exposure, higher beta

**Diversified (lower risk):**
- Shin-Etsu (4063.T) — wafers + photoresists + PVC hedge

**European alternative:**
- Siltronic (WAF.DE) — smaller, takeover optionality

**Basket approach:** Sumco (50%) + Shin-Etsu (50%)
- Captures both pure-play leverage and diversification
- Both Japan-listed, yen exposure

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Yen volatility | Hedge or accept; thesis is structural |
| Cyclicality | AI demand less cyclical than traditional |
| Customer concentration | TSMC/Samsung/Intel all need wafers |
| China retaliation | Monitor rare earth/materials tensions |
| Energy costs | Japan nuclear restart helps |

## Link to other theses

**[[Long Japan photoresists]]**: Same geographic exposure
- Both benefit from Japan materials dominance
- Shin-Etsu captures both theses
- Can combine into Japan semiconductor materials basket

**[[Long WFE]]**: Different part of supply chain
- Equipment = capex cycle (construction phase)
- Wafers = opex (production phase)
- Complementary timing

**[[Long memory]]**: Wafer demand driver
- HBM requires wafers for memory dies
- Memory expansion = wafer demand
