**Memory squeeze thesis** — Consumer RAM is getting squeezed as [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], and [[Micron]] lock [[HBM]] supply to AI hyperscalers. The window for affordable local AI hardware may be closing.

---

## The thesis

[[HBM economics]] creates a structural shift: HBM consumes ~4x wafer capacity per GB vs standard DRAM. As AI hyperscalers ([[NVIDIA]], Google, [[Microsoft]], etc.) lock multi-year HBM supply deals, memory manufacturers are allocating capacity away from consumer products.

Result: DRAM prices **up 172%** since early 2025. Server memory expected to **double** by late 2026.

For anyone wanting to run [[Local-first AI]] or [[Agentic AI]] on personal hardware, the cost is rising fast.

## Evidence

### Supplier behavior

| Supplier | Action | Signal |
|----------|--------|--------|
| [[Micron]] | **Killed Crucial brand** (Feb 2026) | Exiting consumer memory |
| [[Samsung]] | Multi-year HBM deals with hyperscalers | Capacity locked |
| [[SK Hynix]] | 2026 HBM **fully sold out** | No spare capacity |

When suppliers exit consumer markets during a shortage, it's severe.

### OEM responses

| OEM | Response |
|-----|----------|
| [[Dell]] | "Never seen costs move at this rate" |
| [[Lenovo]] | Hoarding 50% extra inventory |
| [[HP Inc.]] | Warning of H2 2026 price hikes |
| [[Xiaomi]] | +25% DRAM cost per phone |
| [[Apple]] | "Managing costs well" (scale advantage) |

### Hardware demand

[[Apple]] Mac Mini experiencing supply chain squeeze — attributed partly to local AI agent demand. Developers building [[Local-first AI]] setups need high-RAM machines, right as supply tightens.

---

## Why this matters

[[Agentic AI]] is creating demand for local compute:
- Run AI gateway locally ([[Clawdbot viral growth|Clawdbot]], etc.)
- Store conversation history, embeddings
- Execute tools, scripts, automation

This requires RAM — ideally 32GB+, often 64GB+. As prices spike, the addressable market for local AI shrinks to those who bought hardware early or can afford premium pricing.

## Investment implications

### Long memory manufacturers

| Ticker | Thesis |
|--------|--------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | #1 HBM, pricing power |
| [[Samsung]] | #2 HBM, catching up |
| [[Micron]] | #3 HBM, US-based |

All three benefit from shortage dynamics. See [[Long memory]].

### Potential losers

| Loser | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| PC OEMs | Margin compression unless pass-through pricing |
| Consumer hardware | DIY market shrinks |
| Budget local AI | Barrier to entry rising |

### Hedge consideration

**Buy local AI hardware now** — if thesis is correct, 64GB Mac Mini today is cheaper than 64GB Mac Mini in 2027.

The [[Clawdbot viral growth|Clawdbot phenomenon]] partly reflects this — developers racing to set up local AI infrastructure before costs rise further.

## Risks to thesis

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| AI demand slows | Memory prices normalize |
| New capacity comes online | 2028+ relief possible |
| Alternative architectures | Reduce memory requirements |
| [[China]] memory ([[CXMT]]) | Adds supply, breaks oligopoly |

---

## What to watch

| Signal | Bullish for thesis | Bearish |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Consumer DRAM prices | Keep rising | Stabilize or fall |
| OEM commentary | More warnings | "Manageable" |
| Memory capex | Stays HBM-focused | Consumer allocation returns |
| [[Micron]] Crucial exit | Permanent | Reversed |
