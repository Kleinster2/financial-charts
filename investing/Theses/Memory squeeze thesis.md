**Memory squeeze thesis** — Consumer RAM is getting squeezed as [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], and [[Micron]] prioritize [[HBM]] supply to AI hyperscalers. The window for affordable local AI hardware may be narrowing.

---

## The thesis

[[HBM economics]] creates a structural shift: HBM consumes ~4x wafer capacity per GB vs standard DRAM. As AI hyperscalers ([[NVIDIA]], Google, [[Microsoft]], etc.) lock multi-year HBM supply deals, memory manufacturers may allocate capacity away from consumer products.

For anyone wanting to run [[Local-first AI]] or [[Agentic AI]] on personal hardware, this could mean rising costs.

## Current market data (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| DDR4 8G spot price | **$30.76-30.90** | TrendForce Feb 2026 |
| Spot market demand | "Weak, suppliers lowering quotes" | TrendForce |
| [[Micron]] stock (1Y) | **+351.74%** | Yahoo Finance |
| [[Micron]] market cap | **$461.7B** | Yahoo Finance |
| [[Micron]] revenue (TTM) | **$42.3B** | Yahoo Finance |

**Important caveat:** TrendForce Feb 2026 reports "weak" DRAM spot demand with suppliers lowering quotes — monitor whether squeeze thesis is materializing or overstated.

## Memory manufacturer positioning

| Supplier | Position | Market cap | HBM rank |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| [[SK Hynix]] | 50%+ HBM share, pricing power | ~$100B+ | \#1 |
| [[Samsung]] | Multi-year hyperscaler deals | ~$300B | \#2 |
| [[Micron]] | US-based, HBM ramping | **$461.7B** | \#3 |

All three benefit from AI-driven HBM demand. [[Micron]]'s stock performance (+351% in one year) reflects this thesis playing out.

## Why this matters for local AI

[[Agentic AI]] is creating demand for local compute:
- Run AI gateway locally (Claude Code, etc.)
- Store conversation history, embeddings
- Execute tools, scripts, automation

Per McKinsey 2025:
- **62%** of organizations experimenting with AI agents
- **23%** scaling agentic AI systems

This requires RAM — ideally 32GB+, often 64GB+. If prices rise, the addressable market for local AI shrinks.

## Investment implications

### Long memory manufacturers

| Ticker | 1Y Return | Thesis |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[Micron]] (MU) | **+351.74%** | \#3 HBM, US-based |
| [[SK Hynix]] | Strong | \#1 HBM, pricing power |
| [[Samsung]] | Mixed | \#2 HBM, foundry diversification |

All three benefit from AI demand. [[Micron]] is investing $24B in new Singapore facility.

### Potential losers

| Loser | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| PC OEMs | Margin compression unless pass-through pricing |
| Consumer hardware | DIY market could shrink |
| Budget local AI | Barrier to entry may rise |

## Risks to thesis

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **AI demand slows** | Medium | Would normalize prices |
| **New capacity online** | Medium | 2028+ relief possible |
| **Current spot weakness** | High | TrendForce shows soft demand |
| **China memory (CXMT)** | Medium | Adds supply, breaks oligopoly |
| **Alternative architectures** | Low | Could reduce memory needs |

**Key uncertainty:** Feb 2026 spot market shows weak demand with suppliers lowering quotes. This may indicate the squeeze is not (yet) materializing in consumer markets, or reflects cyclical softness.

## What to watch

| Signal | Bullish for thesis | Bearish |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| DDR5 pricing | Rising | Stable/falling |
| OEM commentary | Cost warnings | "Manageable" |
| Memory capex | HBM-focused | Consumer allocation returns |
| Spot market | Tight supply | "Weak demand, lowering quotes" |
