**Power infrastructure bottleneck** — Grid constraints, not demand, limiting data center buildout. 5-12 year interconnection queues creating power scarcity premium.

---

## Core thesis

Data center demand is growing 22-23% annually, but grid interconnection delays now stretch 5-12 years. Power access — not land, not capital — is the binding constraint. Companies with existing generation capacity or grid access trade at a premium.

## The numbers

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 2025 data center demand | ~62 GW | S&P Global |
| 2026 data center demand | 75.8 GW | S&P Global |
| 2030 data center demand | 134 GW | S&P Global |
| Interconnection queue | 5+ years | Berkeley Lab |
| AEP queue backlog | 190 GW (5x current system) | AEP |
| New gas capacity online | Not before 2029 | PJM |

**Gap:** 85 GW new data center requests by 2030, but only ~100 GW total capacity (including surplus) available.

---

## Why now

1. **AI capex surge** — Hyperscalers committing unprecedented capital
2. **Queue congestion** — Berkeley Lab shows "unprecedented backlogs"
3. **Supply lag** — Large turbine orders won't deliver until late 2020s
4. **Regulatory friction** — FERC reforms not final until April 2026

"Power crunch appears most severe through 2028-2029."

## Expressions

| Approach | Vehicles | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Nuclear + gas IPPs | [[Vistra]] (VST), [[Constellation]] (CEG) | Regulatory, valuation |
| Merchant gas | [[Calpine]] (now Constellation) | Integration |
| Data center REITs | [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]] | Capex needs |
| Grid equipment | Transformers, switchgear | Commodity |

**Constellation + Calpine merger (Jan 2026):** 55 GW combined = largest US power producer. Positioned for AI demand.

**Vistra + Cogentrix (pending 2026):** Adding 5.5 GW gas fleet to nuclear portfolio.

## IPP thesis

Independent power producers benefit from:
1. **Existing capacity** — No interconnection wait
2. **Baseload reliability** — Nuclear + gas for 24/7 AI workloads
3. **Pricing power** — Scarcity premium on available megawatts
4. **Direct hyperscaler deals** — Calpine signed 190 MW with CyrusOne

"Colocation behaves less like a real estate product and more like a power access product."

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Regulatory acceleration | FERC reforms could ease queues |
| Demand slowdown | AI capex pullback |
| Distributed generation | On-site power bypasses grid |
| Nuclear sentiment shift | Political/safety concerns |
| Valuation | IPPs already re-rated significantly |

## Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Acute shortage | 2025-2029 |
| New gas online | 2029+ |
| Queue reforms | April 2026 (FERC) |
| Nuclear expansion | 2030s |
