Research on the competitive dynamics of advanced semiconductor foundries.

---

## Why "war"

The framing captures dynamics that "competition" undersells:

- **Zero-sum** — Leading-edge customers are scarce. A Samsung win is a TSMC loss.
- **Capital as weapon** — $20B+ fabs are barrier moats. Outspending rivals to exhaust them is deliberate strategy.
- **Geopolitical stakes** — CHIPS Act, China restrictions, Taiwan risk. Governments treat foundry capacity as national security.
- **Winner-take-most** — At leading edge, one foundry dominates each node. No peaceful market-sharing equilibrium.
- **Attrition** — Intel bleeding cash. Samsung yields stuck. GlobalFoundries retreated. Losers exit or get marginalized.

## Actors

The four foundries competing for advanced logic manufacturing:

- [[TSMC]] — dominant incumbent, ~60% share
- [[Samsung]] — aggressive #2, ~7% share
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] — attempting transformation
- [[Rapidus]] — Japan's 2nm national champion, small batch model

Adjacent players:

- [[SK Hynix]] — HBM leader, pushing into packaging to challenge TSMC's CoWoS monopoly
- [[Samsung]] — also memory (DRAM/NAND), not just foundry
- [[Micron]] — U.S. memory, #3 DRAM, benefits from shortage
- [[CXMT]] — Chinese memory, beneficiary of Samsung IP leak

Equipment (WFE):

- [[ASML]] — EUV lithography monopoly, most critical bottleneck
- [[Lam Research]] — deposition and etch leader, memory exposure
- [[Applied Materials]] — largest WFE, most diversified
- [[KLA]] — inspection and metrology, yield-critical

Key customers (fabless):

- [[Apple]] — highest volume leading edge, TSMC anchor, design excellence
- [[NVIDIA]] — AI dominant, locks TSMC capacity, [[CUDA moat]]
- [[AMD]] — challenging NVIDIA on software, potential Samsung customer
- [[Broadcom]] — custom AI chip designer (Google TPUs), enabler for hyperscalers
- [[MediaTek]] — Taiwan fabless, Google's potential Broadcom alternative

AI hyperscalers (demand side):

- [[Google]] — Tier 1, TPUs via Broadcom, disintermediation in progress
- [[Amazon]] — Tier 1, Trainium/Inferentia custom silicon
- [[Microsoft]] — Tier 1, OpenAI partner, largest spender
- [[Meta]] — Tier 1, heavy NVIDIA buyer
- [[Anthropic]] — Tier 2, going TPU route
- [[xAI]] — Tier 2, Musk's AI lab, potential Samsung anchor
- [[Tesla]] — Auto + AI, potential Samsung anchor via Musk
- [[Oracle]] — Tier 2, GPU cloud, NVIDIA partner

Other:

- [[Intel]] — IDM parent company (see [[Intel Foundry Services]] for foundry)
- [[Kioxia]] — Japan NAND #3

## Core concepts

Ideas that explain the competitive dynamics:

**Moats & advantages**
- [[Customer lock-in via co-design]]
- [[Yield as competitive moat]]
- [[Why TSMC can afford patience]]
- [[Advanced packaging]] — CoWoS, 2.5D, another TSMC moat under attack

**Bottlenecks**
- [[Supply chain bottlenecks]] — power, materials, foundry, packaging, memory, test
- [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] — "largest ever supply-demand gap" (Micron)
- [[Final test bottleneck]] — hidden constraint
- [[ASE]] — #1 OSAT, packaging + test
- [[Cohu]] — test handlers, Eclipse platform

**Demand**
- [[End market demand]] — AI/datacenter driving 50% of incremental wafer demand
- [[AI hyperscalers]] — demand side of the supply chain
- [[Hyperscaler chip roadmap]] — custom ASIC programs by company (reference)
- [[Automotive semiconductors]] — SiC, power, ADAS — post-EV boom settling
- [[Power constraints]] — 44GW US data center shortfall, may slow chip deployment

**Risk & strategy**
- [[Execution risk in foundries]]
- [[Why Samsung's aggression may be rational]]
- [[Taiwan concentration risk]]
- [[Node lag as strategy]]
- [[IP leakage risk]]

**Technical dynamics**
- [[N-2 rule]] — export control boundary
- [[Leading edge race]] — node competition

**Policy**
- [[CHIPS Act]]

**Adjacent markets**
- [[Image sensors]] — Samsung leads, shows uneven execution across segments

## Key events

Specific episodes that reveal strategic patterns:

- [[Samsung Taylor pivot]] — high-variance leapfrog bet
- [[TSMC Arizona expansion]] — disciplined geographic insurance

---

## Open questions

Uncertainties worth tracking:

- [[How durable is TSMC's moat]]
- [[Can Samsung ever catch TSMC]]
- [[Will Intel Foundry Services succeed]]
- [[What happens if Taiwan is disrupted]]
- [[Samsung memory vs SK Hynix]] — which is the better memory play?
