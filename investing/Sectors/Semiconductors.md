## Industry size (Gartner, Jan 2026)

| Metric | 2025 | YoY |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Total semiconductor revenue** | **$793B** | **+21%** |
| AI semiconductors (processors, HBM, networking) | ~$264B | — |
| AI share of total | **~1/3** | — |

**Key milestones:**
- **[[NVIDIA]] first company to cross $100B** in semiconductor revenue
- NVIDIA extended lead over [[Samsung]] by $53B in 2025

### AI infrastructure spending

| Metric | 2026 forecast |
|--------|---------------|
| **AI infrastructure spending** | **>$1.3 trillion** |

This is the capex flowing to [[AI hyperscalers]], neoclouds, and enterprises for AI compute, networking, and data centers.

## Current themes (2025-2026)

| Theme | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| [[AI hyperscalers]] demand | NVIDIA dominance, HBM shortage |
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | SK Hynix/Samsung pricing power |
| [[Advanced packaging]] | CoWoS bottleneck, OSAT opportunity |
| [[Export controls]] | China bifurcation, equipment restrictions |
| [[Power constraints]] | Fab siting challenges |
| [[Leading edge race]] | 2nm competition (TSMC vs Samsung vs Intel) |

## Key investment theses

- [[Long NVIDIA]] — AI platform dominance
- [[Long TSMC]] — foundry moat
- [[Long memory]] — HBM cycle
- [[Long WFE]] — equipment leverage
- [[Long Japan photoresists]] — materials chokepoint
- [[Long Japan wafers]] — upstream duopoly
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — packaging bottleneck
- [[Short standalone ASICs]] — consolidation around NVIDIA
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — relative value

## Cyclicality

**Traditional cycle:** 3-4 years, inventory-driven

**AI disruption:** Decoupling from traditional PC/mobile cycle. AI capex creating new demand layer.

| Segment | Cycle exposure |
|---------|----------------|
| Memory | High (but HBM buffered) |
| Equipment | Medium (backlog visibility) |
| Foundry | Low (long-term contracts) |
| Fabless AI | Low (structural demand) |

## Geographic concentration

| Activity | Location | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Leading-edge foundry | Taiwan (90%+) | [[Taiwan concentration risk]] |
| HBM | Korea (95%+) | Moderate |
| Equipment | US, Netherlands, Japan | Low |
| Assembly/test | Asia (China, Malaysia, Vietnam) | Medium |
