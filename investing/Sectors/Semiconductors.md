## Value chain economics

```
Design → Foundry → Packaging → Test → System integration
   ↑         ↑          ↑         ↑
  EDA     Equipment    OSAT     Equipment
```

**Margin stack (approximate):**
| Segment | Gross margin |
|---------|--------------|
| EDA | 80-90% |
| Equipment | 45-55% |
| Fabless design | 60-75% |
| Foundry | 50-55% (TSMC) |
| Memory | 30-65% (cyclical) |
| OSAT | 15-25% |

## Sector KPIs

| Metric | Definition | Good / Target | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Gross Margin** | (Rev - COGS) / Rev | **>60% (Fabless)** | Pricing power & IP value |
| **Inventory Days** | Days to sell inventory | **<80-100 days** | Spotting cyclical gluts/shortages |
| **R&D Intensity** | R&D Expense / Revenue | **>15-20%** | Sustaining innovation lead |
| **CapEx Intensity** | CapEx / Revenue | **>30% (Foundry/Mem)** | Maintaining capacity scale (High = Barrier to entry) |
| **Book-to-Bill** | Orders / Shipments | **>1.1x** | Future demand signal (Equipment) |
| **Yield** | Functional chips / Wafer | **>90% (Mature)** | Manufacturing efficiency (Foundry) |

## Current themes (2025-2026)

| Theme | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| [[AI hyperscalers]] demand | NVIDIA dominance, HBM shortage |
| [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] | SK Hynix/Samsung pricing power |
| [[Advanced packaging]] | CoWoS bottleneck, OSAT opportunity |
| [[Export controls]] | China bifurcation, equipment restrictions |
| [[Power constraints]] | Fab siting challenges |
| [[Leading edge race]] | 2nm competition (TSMC vs Samsung vs Intel) |

---

## Key investment theses

- [[Long NVIDIA]] — AI platform dominance
- [[Long TSMC]] — foundry moat
- [[Long memory]] — HBM cycle
- [[Long WFE]] — equipment leverage
- [[Long OSAT and test equipment]] — packaging bottleneck
- [[Short standalone ASICs]] — consolidation around NVIDIA
- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — relative value

---

## Cyclicality

**Traditional cycle:** 3-4 years, inventory-driven

**AI disruption:** Decoupling from traditional PC/mobile cycle. AI capex creating new demand layer.

| Segment | Cycle exposure |
|---------|----------------|
| Memory | High (but HBM buffered) |
| Equipment | Medium (backlog visibility) |
| Foundry | Low (long-term contracts) |
| Fabless AI | Low (structural demand) |

---

## Geographic concentration

| Activity | Location | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Leading-edge foundry | Taiwan (90%+) | [[Taiwan concentration risk]] |
| HBM | Korea (95%+) | Moderate |
| Equipment | US, Netherlands, Japan | Low |
| Assembly/test | Asia (China, Malaysia, Vietnam) | Medium |
