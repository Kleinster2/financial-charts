# DTC Telehealth

Cash-pay, subscription-based telehealth platforms that sell directly to consumers, bypassing insurance. The fastest-growing segment of [[Telehealth]], driven by [[GLP-1 receptor agonists|GLP-1]] prescribing since 2023 — but facing an existential transition as the compounding loophole closes and branded drug partnerships replace high-margin compounded alternatives.

---

## Market context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US telehealth weight loss market | ~$6.9B (2023), ~7.5% CAGR |
| Americans on GLP-1s | ~18M (~7% of adults) |
| Using telehealth for GLP-1s | ~11.3M |
| DTC model growth (HIMS) | +69% revenue YoY (2024) |
| B2B model growth (TDOC) | -1% revenue YoY (2024) |

DTC cash-pay has dramatically outperformed B2B enterprise telehealth on growth. The structural reason: DTC platforms monetize through pharmacy margin on high-demand medications (GLP-1s, ED drugs, hair loss), while B2B platforms earn per-member-per-month fees that grow with headcount, not demand.

### DTC cash-pay platforms

|---------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[Hims & Hers]] | HIMS | $1.48B | +69% | ~$5.6B | Profitable ($126M net income). Novo terminated Jun 2025, sued Feb 2026. Stock -50% from Feb 2025 peak. |

### B2B enterprise telehealth (comparison)

| Company | Ticker | 2024 Revenue | Growth | Market cap | Status |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| [[Teladoc]] | TDOC | $2.57B | -1% | ~$889M | Down ~98% from $308 peak (Feb 2021). Livongo acquisition ($18.5B) was the defining failure. |
| [[Amwell]] | AMWL | $254M | -2% | ~$90M | Sub-$100M market cap with $254M revenue. Targeting positive cash flow 2026. |
| Transcarent | Private | — | — | — | Acquired 98point6 ($100M) and [[Accolade]] ($621M). 20M+ members. |

### Adjacent

| Company | Ticker | 2024 Revenue | Market cap | Model |

## Value chain

```
Consumer acquisition (marketing, celebrity, SEO)
    → Async intake / video consultation
        → Diagnosis + Rx decision
            → Pharmacy fulfillment (in-house or partner)
                → Home delivery
                    → Subscription retention / refill
```

Margin stack:
- Drug cost: ~15-30% of subscription price (compounded), ~60-80% (branded)
- Platform/clinician cost: ~10-15%
- Marketing/acquisition: ~25-35% (HIMS spends ~$200M/yr on marketing)
- Gross margin: ~75-80% (compounded era), ~50-60% (branded era)

The compounding-to-branded transition compresses gross margins significantly. [[Hims & Hers]] gross margin already slipped from 79.5% to 75.0% in Q3 2025.

## What separates winners from losers

| Factor | Winners | Losers |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Pharma relationships | [[Ro]] (Novo partner, Lilly partner) | [[Hims & Hers]] (Novo terminated, sued) |
| Vertical integration | [[Ro]] (owns pharmacy + diagnostics) | Calibrate (relied on third-party supply) |
| Regulatory compliance | [[Ro]] (transitioned to branded) | Compounders still fighting FDA |
| Unit economics | HIMS profitable at scale | AMWL losing $50M/yr on $254M revenue |
| Category concentration | LifeMD (>50% weight management) is risky | Diversified condition mix is more durable |
| Cash-pay vs insurance | DTC grows faster | B2B is saturated |

## M&A activity (2023-2026)

| Date | Deal | Value | Significance |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Feb 2023 | [[Amazon]] closes One Medical | $3.9B | Big tech enters primary care |
| Mar 2023 | Transcarent acquires 98point6 | ~$100M | AI-first telehealth to B2B |
| H1 2023 | [[Humana]] acquires Heal | $100M | Payer vertical integration |
| Apr 2025 | Transcarent acquires [[Accolade]] | $621M | $7.03/share (110% premium) |
| Q4 2025 | Remedy Meds acquires Thirty Madison | ~$500M | All-stock; combined $670M revenue |

Telehealth M&A: 42 deals (2023), 53 deals (2024). H1 2025 pace suggests 500+ deals for the year. Consolidation is accelerating as standalone platforms struggle.

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact | Who's exposed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| FDA compounding crackdown | Eliminates high-margin compounded GLP-1 supply | [[Hims & Hers]], LifeMD, smaller platforms |
| Novo/Lilly disintermediation | NovoCare and LillyDirect go direct-to-patient | All DTC platforms |
| Insurance expansion for GLP-1s | Patients shift from cash-pay to covered providers | All DTC cash-pay |
| DEA telehealth rules expiring Dec 2026 | Controlled substance prescribing may require in-person | All telehealth |
| Customer churn (~50%/yr) | Structural across DTC telehealth | All platforms |
| Weight regain post-discontinuation | ~2/3 of weight regained within 1 year of stopping GLP-1 | Weight-focused platforms |

## Stock performance

| Ticker | Peak | Peak date | Current (~Feb 2026) | Decline |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| HIMS | $68.74 | Feb 19, 2025 | ~$25 | -64% |
| TDOC | $308 | Feb 16, 2021 | ~$5 | -98% |
| AMWL | ~$40 | Feb 2021 | ~$5.50 | -86% |
| GDRX | $64.22 | Sep 29, 2020 | ~$2.20 | -97% |
| LFMD | $15.84 | 52-wk high | ~$5 | -68% |

The sector is bifurcated: DTC cash-pay (HIMS) briefly worked until the compounding crackdown, while B2B (TDOC, AMWL) has been in multi-year decline. No public telehealth stock is within 50% of its all-time high.
