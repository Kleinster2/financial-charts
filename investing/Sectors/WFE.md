# WFE

Wafer fab equipment — the picks and shovels of semiconductors. Tightest sector correlation (0.70) due to shared customers and capex cycles.

*LRCX outperforming, but all four move together. AMAT-LRCX especially tight (0.90 correlation).*

## Key actors

| Company | Focus | Position |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [[ASML]] | Lithography (EUV monopoly) | Irreplaceable, highest margins |
| [[Applied Materials]] | Deposition, etch, CMP | Broadest portfolio |
| [[Lam Research]] | Etch, deposition | Memory + logic |
| [[KLA]] | Inspection, metrology | Quality control |

## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.70** | Strong (tightest semi cluster) |
| Range | 0.54 - 0.90 | KLA pairs to AMAT-LRCX |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| AMAT - LRCX | **0.90** | Near-identical exposure |
| ASML - AMAT | 0.82 | |
| ASML - LRCX | 0.81 | |
| AMAT - KLAC | 0.54 | KLA slightly different |
| ASML - KLAC | 0.55 | |
| LRCX - KLAC | 0.55 | |

**Note:** AMAT-LRCX at 0.90 is one of the highest correlations in semis. KLA is slightly differentiated (inspection vs deposition/etch).

## Why this cluster is tight

1. **Same customers** — TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Micron all buy from same vendors
2. **Same capex cycle** — Equipment orders track fab buildout plans
3. **Oligopoly structure** — Limited competition, coordinated pricing
4. **Long lead times** — 12-18 month backlogs create visibility

## Sector economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross margins | 45-55% |
| Book-to-bill | >1.1x = bullish signal |
| Capex intensity | Low (design, not fabs) |
| Cyclicality | Medium (backlog smooths) |

## Investment thesis

**[[Long WFE]]** — Leveraged bet on semiconductor capex without picking chip winners.

| Bull | Bear |
|------|------|
| AI driving capex boom | Cyclical peak risk |
| EUV upgrade cycle | China restrictions limit TAM |
| Oligopoly pricing | Customer concentration |
| Backlog visibility | Long-cycle inventory risk |
