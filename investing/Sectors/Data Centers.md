## Market segments

### Colocation REITs

| Company | Market cap | Focus | AI relevance |
|---------|------------|-------|--------------|
| [[Equinix]] | ~$80B | Interconnection | Moderate (enterprise) |
| [[Digital Realty]] | ~$50B | Wholesale hyperscale | High (AI workloads) |
| CoreSite | (Owned by [[American Tower]]) | US interconnection | Moderate |
| CyrusOne | (Owned by [[KKR]]) | Enterprise | Moderate |
| QTS | (Owned by [[Blackstone]]) | Hyperscale | High |

**Business model:** Long-term leases, inflation escalators, 60-70% gross margins.

### GPU clouds (Neoclouds)

| Company | Status | Customers | Risk |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| [[CoreWeave]] | Public (CRWV) | Microsoft (65%) | High concentration |
| [[Lambda Labs]] | Private | AI startups | Smaller scale |
| [[Crusoe Energy]] | Private | Stranded gas model | Unusual cost structure |
| Voltage Park | Private | Foundation Capital | Emerging |

**Thesis:** Fill GPU demand hyperscalers can't meet. See [[Neocloud financing]].

### Crypto-to-AI pivots

| Company | Ticker | Pivot status |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [[Core Scientific]] | CORZ | $3.5B CoreWeave deal |
| [[Hut 8]] | HUT | AI + BTC hybrid |
| [[IREN]] | IREN | Expanding AI |
| [[Bitdeer]] | BTDR | NVIDIA deal |
| [[TeraWulf]] | WULF | AI hosting |
| [[Cipher Mining]] | CIFR | AI expansion |

See [[Crypto-to-AI pivot]] for full analysis.

### Hyperscaler-owned

| Hyperscaler | 2025 capex | Focus |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| [[Microsoft]] Azure | ~$80B | AI/cloud |
| [[Amazon]] AWS | ~$75B | AI/cloud |
| [[Google]] GCP | ~$50B | AI/cloud |
| [[Meta]] | ~$60B | AI training |
| [[Oracle]] | ~$16B | Catching up |

**Trend:** Hyperscalers building own vs leasing. See [[AI hyperscalers]].

## Geographic hubs

| Hub | Significance |
|-----|--------------|
| [[Ashburn]] (Virginia) | 70% of US internet traffic |
| [[Dallas Data Hub]] | Low power costs, growing |
| [[Phoenix Data Hub]] | Land, power availability |
| [[Columbus Ohio]] | Midwest hub, Intel investment |
| [[São Paulo Data Hub]] | LatAm leader |
| [[Singapore Tech]] | Asia-Pacific hub |
| London | European financial hub |
| Frankfurt | European cloud hub |

---

## Power constraints

**Critical bottleneck:** AI data centers need 10-50x power density of traditional.

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Grid capacity | Multi-year wait for connections |
| Utility buildout | Can't keep pace with demand |
| Renewable targets | Conflicts with 24/7 needs |
| Nuclear option | [[Nuclear power for AI]] gaining traction |

See [[Power constraints]] and [[Clean energy for AI]].

## Cooling technology

| Technology | Status | Players |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Air cooling | Legacy | Traditional DCs |
| Liquid cooling | Scaling | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]] |
| Immersion cooling | Emerging | GRC, Submer |
| Rear-door heat exchangers | Growing | [[Modine Manufacturing]] |

**AI GPUs require liquid cooling:** Air can't handle 700W+ chips.

---

## Power infrastructure

| Component | Key players |
|-----------|-------------|
| UPS systems | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]], Eaton |
| Generators | Caterpillar, Cummins |
| Transformers | [[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]] |
| Switchgear | [[Schneider Electric]], ABB |

---

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| REIT yield + growth | [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]] |
| AI infrastructure | [[CoreWeave]], [[IREN]], [[Core Scientific]] |
| Picks & shovels | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]] |
| Crypto-AI arbitrage | [[Hut 8]], [[TeraWulf]] |
| Power plays | [[Constellation Energy]], [[Vistra]] |
