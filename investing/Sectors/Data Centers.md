## Market segments

### Colocation REITs

| Company | Market cap | Focus | AI relevance |
|---------|------------|-------|--------------|
| [[Equinix]] | ~$80B | Interconnection | Moderate (enterprise) |
| [[Digital Realty]] | ~$50B | Wholesale hyperscale | High (AI workloads) |
| CoreSite | (Owned by [[American Tower]]) | US interconnection | Moderate |
| CyrusOne | (Owned by [[KKR]]) | Enterprise | Moderate |
| **QTS** | (Owned by [[Blackstone]]) | Hyperscale | **Dominant** |

**Business model:** Long-term leases, inflation escalators, 60-70% gross margins.

### Private capital ownership

Major platforms now owned by private capital. See [[Private Real Estate]] for investment detail.

| Platform | Owner | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **[[QTS Data Centers]]** | [[Blackstone]] | 70+ facilities, 2+ GW, $25B+ pipeline |
| **[[CyrusOne]]** | [[KKR]] | 50+ facilities |
| **Related Digital** | [[Related Companies]] | New platform (2025) |

### GPU clouds (Neoclouds)

| Company | Status | Customers | Risk |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| [[CoreWeave]] | Public (CRWV) | Microsoft (65%) | High concentration |
| [[Lambda Labs]] | Private | AI startups | Smaller scale |
| [[Crusoe Energy]] | Private | Stranded gas model | Unusual cost structure |
| Voltage Park | Private | Foundation Capital | Emerging |

**Thesis:** Fill GPU demand hyperscalers can't meet. See [[Neocloud financing]].

## Brazil / Latin America

**LatAm's largest DC market** — two GW-scale "AI City" projects under development, all private.

| Operator | Owner | Key Project | Potential |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| [[Scala Data Centers]] | [[DigitalBridge]] | Scala AI City (RS) | **4.75GW** |
| [[Elea Data Centers]] | [[Goldman Sachs]]/[[Piemonte Holding]] | Rio AI City | **3.2GW** |
| [[Ascenty]] | [[Digital Realty]]/[[Brookfield]] | 38 facilities | 4,000+ km fiber |
| [[ODATA]] | [[Aligned Data Centers]] (Macquarie) | 23 facilities | ~2GW buildout |
| [[V.tal]] (Tecto) | [[BTG Pactual]]/GIC/CPP | Fiber + DC | $1B investment |

**Why Brazil for AI:**
- 80%+ renewable grid (hydro) — sustainability credentials
- Sub-80ms latency to US via [[Malbec Cable]]
- Lower power costs than US/Europe
- Growing domestic demand (fintech, enterprise)

**REDATA incentives (PM 1,318/2025):** Tax suspensions (PIS/Cofins, IPI, import duties) for DCs meeting 100% renewable + strict water efficiency (≤0.05 L/kWh). R$5.2B budget, R$2T investment potential over 10 years. Effective Jan 1, 2026. **Legislative risk:** Must convert to law by Feb 25, 2026 — Congress slow to act. See [[Brazil AI]] for details.

**Financing:** Brazilian domestic [[Green bonds]] dominant. [[Bradesco BBI]] leads, with [[UBS BB]], [[Itaú BBA]], [[Santander Brasil]]. Scala issued BRL 5.32B total — record for Brazil DC sector.

**No public exposure:** All major Brazil DC operators are private. Indirect plays: [[DigitalBridge]] (DBRG) owns Scala, [[Digital Realty]] (DLR) owns 51% of Ascenty.

## Power constraints

**Critical bottleneck:** AI data centers need 10-50x power density of traditional.

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Grid capacity | Multi-year wait for connections |
| Utility buildout | Can't keep pace with demand |
| Renewable targets | Conflicts with 24/7 needs |
| Nuclear option | [[Nuclear power for AI]] gaining traction |

See [[Power constraints]] and [[Clean energy for AI]].

---

## Cooling technology

| Technology | Status | Players |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Air cooling | Legacy | Traditional DCs |
| Liquid cooling | Scaling | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]] |
| Immersion cooling | Emerging | GRC, Submer |
| Rear-door heat exchangers | Growing | [[Modine Manufacturing]] |

**AI GPUs require liquid cooling:** Air can't handle 700W+ chips.

---

## Power infrastructure

| Component | Key players |
|-----------|-------------|
| UPS systems | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]], Eaton |
| Generators | Caterpillar, Cummins |
| Transformers | [[GE Vernova]], [[Siemens Energy]] |

## Correlation structure

*Data Centers as a whole: 0.39 — too weak. Splits into distinct sub-sectors.*

| Sub-sector | Correlation | Key players |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **[[DC REITs]]** | **0.69** | EQIX, DLR |
| **[[Crypto-to-AI]]** | **0.61** | CORZ, HUT, IREN, WULF |
| **Cross-sector** | 0.08-0.20 | REITs vs Crypto barely correlated |

REITs and Crypto-to-AI are fundamentally different businesses despite both owning data centers.

## Sub-sectors

| Sub-sector | Correlation | Key players | Sister concept |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **[[DC REITs]]** | 0.69 | [[Equinix]], [[Digital Realty]] | — |
| **[[Crypto-to-AI]]** | 0.61 | [[Core Scientific]], [[Hut 8]], [[IREN]], [[TeraWulf]] | [[Crypto-to-AI pivot]] |
| **GPU clouds (neoclouds)** | — | [[CoreWeave]], [[Lambda Labs]] | [[Neocloud financing]] |
| **Cooling/power equipment** | — | [[Vertiv]], [[Schneider Electric]], [[Modine Manufacturing]] | [[Water constraints]] |
