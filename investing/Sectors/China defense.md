## Scale and rankings

**7 Chinese firms in global top 20** defense companies by revenue (Defense News 2018).

| Company | Defense revenue (2019) | % of total revenue |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| AVIC | ~$25B | ~40% |
| Norinco | ~$14B (2024: down 31%) | ~22% |
| CETC | ~$12B | ~50% |
| CASC | ~$10B | — |
| CASIC | ~$8B | — |

**Key feature:** All are conglomerates with significant civilian business. Norinco is 78% non-defense (machinery, chemicals, vehicles).

## Recent developments (2024-2025)

**Anti-corruption crackdown:**
- Investigations reaching highest levels of military
- Slowed procurement, created uncertainty
- Revenue declines across major SOEs

**Revenue drops (2024):**
- Norinco: **-31%** to $14B
- AVIC, CASC also down
- Procurement delays from corruption probes

**SOE reform:**
- 3-year reform plan largely implemented
- AVIC \#1 defense SOE four years running
- Consolidation (CSSC + CSIC merger)

## Investment lens

**Not directly investable** for Western capital:
- SOE status (no foreign ownership)
- US sanctions/Entity List designations
- Pentagon "Chinese Military Company" list

**Why it matters:**
- Scale of China's defense industrial base
- Dual-use technology development
- Supply chain for PLA modernization
- Competition with Western defense primes

**Listed subsidiaries:** Some SOE subsidiaries trade on Chinese exchanges (Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong) but face sanctions risk.

## US restrictions

| List | Implications |
|------|--------------|
| **Entity List** (BIS) | Export license required |
| **CMC List** (Pentagon) | US investment restrictions |
| **SDN List** (OFAC) | Sanctions, asset freezes |

Most major Chinese defense SOEs appear on one or more lists.
