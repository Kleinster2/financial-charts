#sector #iran #banking #crisis

**Iranian banking sector** — Effectively insolvent system operating as country-wide Ponzi scheme. IRGC-linked, sanctions-isolated, ~40% distressed. Ayandeh collapse (Oct 2025) exposed rot.

## Sector overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Number of banks | ~30 |
| Total assets | ~$500B (nominal, distorted by rial) |
| Average capital adequacy | ~5% (Basel minimum: 8%) |
| Banks near insolvency | 6+ including Sepah |
| NPLs from top 27 debtors | ~$10B+ |
| International access | SWIFT blocked, USD blocked |

## Structure

### Central Bank of Iran (CBI / Bank Markazi)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Founded | 1960 |
| Role | Monetary policy, bank supervision, currency issuance |
| Governor | Abdolnaser Hemmati (Dec 2025-present) |
| Previous governor | Mohammad-Reza Farzin (resigned Dec 29, 2025) |
| Sanctions | US (E.O. 13224), designated for IRGC support |
| Israel designation | Declared terrorist organization (Jun 25, 2025) |

**CBI is the problem, not the solution:** Prints money to bail out insolvent banks → inflation → rial collapse → more bank stress → more printing.

### Major state banks

| Bank | Founded | Branches | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Bank Melli** | 1928 | 3,300+ | Largest in Iran/Middle East, absorbed Ayandeh |
| **Bank Sepah** | 1925 | — | Oldest, military-linked, absorbed 5 banks (2019-2022) |
| **Bank Saderat** | 1952 | 2,200+ | Export-focused |
| **Bank Mellat** | 1980 | — | Designated terrorist org by Israel (Jun 2025) |
| **Bank Tejarat** | 1979 | — | Trade finance |

### Major private banks

| Bank | Status |
|------|--------|
| **[[Ayandeh Bank]]** | Collapsed Oct 2025, merged into Bank Melli |
| Pasargad Bank | Operating, MAPNA exposure |
| Parsian Bank | Operating, MAPNA exposure |

## Why the system is insolvent

### The Ponzi dynamic

```
Banks offer high deposit rates to attract funds
    → Lend to connected insiders at low rates (or no repayment)
        → NPLs accumulate
            → Can't pay depositors
                → Borrow from CBI
                    → CBI prints money
                        → Inflation
                            → Rial collapses
                                → Real value of deposits destroyed
```

**The Wall Street Journal:** "The banking system—with enormous amounts of non-income-generating assets—faced a severe cash flow problem and essentially turned into a country-wide Ponzi scheme."

### Non-performing loans

| Debtor type | Example | NPL exposure |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| IRGC-linked companies | MAPNA Group, Khuzestan Steel | Largest debtors |
| Regime-connected | Ghadir Investment (Khamenei) | Top 27 debtors |
| Real estate | Iran Mall (Ayandeh) | Illiquid, overvalued |
| State enterprises | Various | Political loans |

**Top 27 institutional debtors:** ~790 trillion rials ($10B+) in NPLs — and these loans were issued when rial was worth more.

### Capital adequacy disaster

| Bank | CAR | Basel II minimum |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Ayandeh (at collapse) | **-600%** | 8% |
| Sector average (2025) | ~5% | 8% |
| Healthy bank | 12-15% | 8% |

A bank with -600% capital adequacy isn't a bank — it's a hole.

## IRGC and regime capture

The banking system is an extraction mechanism for regime insiders.

### Military-bank nexus

| Entity | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| **Bank Sepah** | Services MODAFL (Ministry of Defense), absorbed military banks |
| **Hekmat Iranian Bank** | Armed forces bank, merged into Sepah (2020) |
| **IRGC** | ~50% stake in Khuzestan Steel (major debtor) |
| **MAPNA Group** | IRGC-linked, largest debtor to Pasargad, Parsian, Saderat |
| **Ghadir Investment** | Khamenei-controlled, among top NPL debtors |

### Ayandeh's IRGC connection

UK sanctioned Ayandeh's founder days after collapse, calling him a "corrupt Iranian banker and businessman" who helped finance the IRGC.

### How extraction works

1. Connected entity gets loan (often unsecured)
2. Loan not repaid
3. Bank books NPL but doesn't foreclose (political protection)
4. Bank borrows from CBI to cover shortfall
5. CBI prints money
6. Inflation transfers wealth from depositors to borrowers
7. Repeat

## International isolation

### SWIFT and USD

| System | Iran access |
|--------|-------------|
| SWIFT | Blocked (2018) |
| USD clearing | Blocked |
| Correspondent banking | None (Western banks won't touch) |
| CHIPS | Blocked |

See [[Iranian economic collapse]] for detailed banking isolation analysis.

### Sanctions on banks

**US Treasury (2020):** Sanctioned 18 major Iranian banks, covering virtually entire sector.

| Bank | Sanction basis |
|------|----------------|
| CBI | IRGC support |
| Bank Melli | WMD proliferation |
| Bank Sepah | MODAFL support |
| Bank Saderat | Terrorism financing |
| Bank Mellat | WMD proliferation |

**Israel (Jun 2025):** Declared CBI, Shahr Bank, Mellat Bank terrorist organizations.

### Only lifeline: Russia

**November 2024:** Bank Saderat, Tejarat, Melli, Sepah, Mellat, Refah, Gardeshgary, Pasargad connected to Russia's VTB for cross-border card payments.

## Resolution pattern

| Period | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 1979 | Post-revolution nationalization |
| 2019-2022 | 5 military-affiliated banks merged into Sepah |
| Oct 2025 | Ayandeh merged into Bank Melli |
| 2025 | CBI warned 8 more banks face closure |

**Pattern:** Failing banks absorbed by state banks, losses socialized via inflation.

---

## Banks flagged as distressed (2025)

| Bank | Status |
|------|--------|
| [[Ayandeh Bank]] | Collapsed |
| Bank Sepah | Near insolvency (despite absorbing 5 banks) |
| 4+ others | CBI flagged as "highly imbalanced" |

---

## Investment implications

**Not investable** — no foreign access, all under sanctions.

**Matters for:**
- [[Iranian economic collapse]] — banking crisis as accelerant
- Contagion risk to regional banks (limited, Iran isolated)
- Inflation/rial trajectory — CBI monetization continues

---

## What to watch

- [ ] Additional bank failures/mergers
- [ ] CBI money printing data
- [ ] Deposit flight indicators
- [ ] NPL disclosures
- [ ] Protest spread tied to bank losses
