## Category breakdown

| Category | Key players | Dynamics |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Fashion & Leather** | Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Gucci | Highest margins, brand-dependent |
| **Jewelry** | Cartier, Tiffany, Van Cleef | Store of value, resilient |

## Industry structure

**Conglomerate model dominates:** LVMH proved that a portfolio of luxury brands under professional management outperforms independent houses. Others followed (Kering, Richemont, Prada acquiring Versace).

**Margin hierarchy:**
| Company | Operating margin | Why |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Hermès | ~40% | Scarcity, no discounting |
| Louis Vuitton | ~35%+ | Scale, pricing power |
| Cartier/Richemont | ~25-30% | Jewelry economics |
| Kering | ~15% (down from 27%) | Gucci turnaround |

---

## China — the swing factor

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China share of global luxury | ~25-30% |
| 2024 China luxury growth | Negative (most groups) |
| Recovery outlook | Uncertain, consumer confidence weak |

**The problem:** Chinese luxury demand collapsed in 2024 after post-COVID sugar rush. Aspirational consumers pulled back; ultra-wealthy still spending but cautiously. Japan benefiting from weak yen (Chinese tourists shopping there instead).

## The real estate shift

Luxury brands are **buying** flagship locations rather than leasing — a structural change. See [[Fifth Avenue luxury corridor]].

| Buyer | Property | Price |
|-------|----------|-------|
| [[Kering]] | 715 Fifth Ave | $963M |
| [[Prada]] | 720-724 Fifth Ave | $835M |
| [[LVMH]] | Tiffany flagship reno | $500M+ |

**Thesis:** Owned flagships become strategic assets, not operating expenses. Controls brand experience permanently.

## Recovery thesis (Jan 2026)

![[lvmh-fashion-leather-organic-growth.png]]
*[[LVMH]] Fashion & Leather organic growth collapsed from +21% (Q2 2023) to -8% (Q2 2025), now stabilizing at -3%. Source: LVMH company presentation.*

**The bull case is intact but not proven yet** (FT, Jan 28, 2026):

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| H2 vs H1 | LVMH +1% organic (H2) vs -3% (H1) — less bad |
| Asia ex-Japan | +1% in Q4 — first positive quarter |
| China stabilizing | Ferragamo China: mid-teens decline (Q3) → low single digits (Q4) |
| Margin discipline | LVMH Fashion & Leather margin ~35% in Q4 (2pp above expectations) |
| 2026 consensus | LVMH +1.7% revenue growth (vs typical +5%) |

**Chinese customers still 23% of global luxury spending** (Bernstein). Any recovery depends on them returning.

**Risks:** Global political tensions, tariffs, rise of lower-priced challengers.

## Current dynamics (2025-2026)

| Theme | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Aspirational vs ultra-high-net-worth** | Bifurcation — top-end resilient, aspirational weak |
| **China stabilizing** | Decline slowing, not yet growing |
| **Jewelry outperforming fashion** | Store of value > discretionary |
| **Creative director musical chairs** | Demna to Gucci, industry reshuffling |
| **Owned real estate** | Balance sheet strategy, Fifth Ave buying spree |
| **Japan strength** | Weak yen driving tourism spend |
| **Margin focus** | Cost discipline while waiting for recovery |

---

## Investment framework

**What works in luxury:**
- Scarcity and pricing power (Hermès model)
- Jewelry > fashion in downturns
- Owned distribution (DTC, owned stores, owned real estate)
- Heritage brands with multi-generational equity

**What doesn't:**
- Over-exposure to aspirational consumers
- Creative director risk (Kering/Gucci)
- Wholesale dependence
- China concentration without diversification
