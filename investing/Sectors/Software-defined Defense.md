# Software-defined Defense

Defense companies where the core value is software and AI, not hardware manufacturing. The weapon is "smart" because of code — hardware is increasingly commoditized or attritable.

---

## Why this is a distinct sector

| Trait | Traditional Primes | Software-defined Defense |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Core asset** | Manufacturing, supply chain, cleared workforce | Software, AI models, data |
| **Business model** | Cost-plus contracts, 10+ year cycles | Product sales, faster iteration |
| **Margins** | 10-12% operating (gov't capped) | Software margins (50%+) potential |
| **Moat** | Incumbency, program lock-in, clearances | Technology, speed, talent |
| **Talent** | Aerospace engineers, program managers | Silicon Valley AI/ML engineers |
| **Funding path** | Gov't advances, debt | VC → gov't contracts |
| **Valuation** | 15-25x P/E | Growth multiples, VC marks |

**The shift:** Ukraine validated that cheap drones + good software beat expensive legacy systems. The future of warfare is autonomous, networked, and software-driven.

|---------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [[Anduril]] | ~$14B | Autonomous systems, counter-drone | Lattice OS |
| [[Shield AI]] | $5.3B | Autonomous aircraft | Hivemind AI pilot |
| [[Skydio]] | ~$2.2B | Autonomous drones | Skydio X10 |
| [[Saronic]] | ~$1.5B | Autonomous surface vessels | USVs |

| [[Rebellion Defense]] | ~$1B+ | AI for simulations, wargaming |
| [[Vannevar Labs]] | ~$500M | AI for intelligence analysis |
| [[Primer AI]] | ~$500M | NLP for intel, open source analysis |
| [[Hawkeye 360]] | ~$800M | RF geolocation, maritime tracking |
| [[Epirus]] | ~$1.3B | Directed energy, counter-drone |

### Private — space

| Company | Valuation | Focus |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| [[SpaceX]] | ~$350B | Launch, Starlink (comms) |
| [[Rocket Lab]] | ~$11B | Small launch, spacecraft |
| [[Capella Space]] | ~$1B | SAR imaging |

## What makes it "software-defined"

### Anduril — Lattice OS

[[Anduril]]'s core product isn't drones or towers — it's **Lattice**, an operating system that:
- Fuses sensor data from any source
- Enables autonomous decision-making
- Commands any hardware (drones, boats, towers)

The hardware is modular. Lattice is the moat.

### Shield AI — Hivemind

[[Shield AI]]'s **Hivemind** is an AI pilot that can:
- Fly any aircraft autonomously
- Operate GPS-denied (critical for contested environments)
- Coordinate swarms

The F-16 is hardware. Hivemind is the product.

### Palantir — Gotham/AIP

[[Palantir]]'s value is making sense of data:
- Gotham: Intelligence analysis platform
- AIP: AI Platform for enterprises and gov't
- Integrates with any data source

No hardware. Pure software.

## Ukraine validation

The Russia-Ukraine war proved software-defined warfare works:

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Cheap drones defeat expensive armor | Attritable > exquisite |
| Software updates faster than hardware | Iteration speed matters |
| Commercial tech adapts quickly | Starlink, DJI drones |
| AI targeting multiplies force | Autonomous > manual |
| EW/jamming is pervasive | GPS-denied capability critical |

Traditional primes build $100M jets. Software-defined defense builds $10K drones with $1M of AI.

## Business model differences

### Traditional defense

```
Win contract → Design (5 yrs) → Build (10 yrs) → Maintain (30 yrs)
Revenue: Cost-plus, progress payments
Margin: Capped ~10-12%
```

### Software-defined defense

```
Build product → Demo to customer → Win contract → Iterate
Revenue: Product sales, SaaS-like potential
Margin: Software margins possible (50%+)
```

**Key difference:** Software companies can sell the same product to multiple customers. Traditional primes build bespoke systems for each contract.

## Investor landscape

| Investor | Notable investments |
|----------|---------------------|
| [[a16z]] | Anduril, Shield AI, Saronic |
| [[Founders Fund]] | Anduril, Palantir, SpaceX |
| [[General Catalyst]] | Shield AI |
| [[Lux Capital]] | Anduril, Epirus |
| [[8VC]] | Palantir, Anduril |
| [[Point72]] Ventures | Shield AI |

VC interest in defense surged post-Ukraine. Previously taboo sector now attracts top-tier capital.

## Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Procurement** | Gov't buying process still slow, favors incumbents |
| **Clearances** | Talent needs security clearances (bottleneck) |
| **Scale** | Harder to manufacture hardware at scale than software |
| **Primes fight back** | Lockheed, RTX acquiring/partnering with startups |
| **Profitability** | Most still burning cash, unproven at scale |
| **Regulatory** | Autonomous weapons face policy scrutiny |

---

## Investment themes

| Theme | Beneficiaries |
|-------|---------------|
| **Autonomous systems** | [[Anduril]], [[Shield AI]], [[Skydio]], [[Saronic]] |
| **AI/data platforms** | [[Palantir]] |
| **Counter-drone** | [[Anduril]], [[Epirus]] |
| **Space/comms** | [[SpaceX]], [[Rocket Lab]] |
| **ISR/sensing** | [[Hawkeye 360]], [[Capella Space]] |

## Valuation

| Company | Valuation | Revenue (est) | Multiple |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [[Palantir]] | $180B | ~$3B | 60x |
| [[Anduril]] | $14B | ~$1B | 14x |
| [[Shield AI]] | $5.3B | ~$200M? | 25x+ |
| [[Skydio]] | $2.2B | ~$200M? | 10x+ |

Valuations reflect growth expectations and strategic premium. [[Palantir]] is public and trades at AI multiples. Private companies valued on last round (may be stale).

## Relationship to traditional defense

Not replacing primes — **complementing and pressuring them**:

| Dynamic | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | L3Harris bought Aerojet, RTX acquiring AI startups |
| **Partnership** | Shield AI + Kratos on V-BAT |
| **Competition** | Anduril vs. Northrop on counter-drone |
| **Subcontracting** | Palantir as data layer for prime programs |

Primes have distribution (gov't relationships). Startups have technology. Expect M&A.
