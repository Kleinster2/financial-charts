## Industry dynamics

### Consolidation trend

**"Platformization"** — enterprises reducing vendor count:

| Approach | Leader |
|----------|--------|
| Network → cloud → SOC | Palo Alto |
| Endpoint → cloud → identity | CrowdStrike |
| Identity → governance | Okta |

Winners: Platform vendors
Losers: Point solutions

### Microsoft factor

Microsoft Defender becoming viable:
- Free/bundled with E5
- Good enough for many enterprises
- Compresses pure-play valuations

---

## Growth drivers

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Attack sophistication** | Continuous spend |
| **Cloud migration** | New attack surface |
| **Remote work** | Zero trust adoption |
| **Regulatory compliance** | Mandatory spend |
| **AI threats** | Next-gen attacks |
| **AI defense** | Automation opportunity |

---

## Business model

| Metric | Healthy range |
|--------|---------------|
| ARR growth | 20-30%+ |
| Net retention | 115-130% |
| Gross margin | 70-80% |
| FCF margin | 20-35% |
| Rule of 40 | 40%+ |

Subscription/recurring = high visibility.

## Investment positioning

| Company | Bull case | Bear case |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [[Palo Alto Networks]] | Platform leader, AI | Execution risk, free trials |
| [[CrowdStrike]] | Cloud-native, endpoint leader | Valuation, July 2024 outage |
| [[Fortinet]] | Mid-market, margins | Enterprise weakness |
| Zscaler | Zero trust leader | Competition, growth slowing |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Microsoft bundling** | Pricing pressure |
| **Economic slowdown** | IT budget cuts |
| **Breach at vendor** | Reputation (see CrowdStrike outage) |
| **Commoditization** | Margin compression |
| **AI disruption** | New attack/defense paradigms |
