# Fashion

The global apparel and fashion industry — from ultra-fast fashion to luxury houses — encompasses design, manufacturing, retail, and e-commerce. ~$1.7T global market. Structurally bifurcating: luxury brands gain pricing power while mid-market collapses and ultra-fast fashion races to the bottom.

## Industry segments

| Segment | Key players | Revenue model | Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Ultra-luxury** | [[Hermès]], Chanel | Scarcity, waitlists | 35-40% |
| **Luxury** | [[LVMH]], [[Kering]], [[Prada]] | Brand, DTC | 20-35% |
| **Premium** | Ralph Lauren, Burberry, Moncler | Aspiration, wholesale + DTC | 15-25% |
| **Mid-market** | Gap, H&M, Zara (Inditex) | Volume, speed | 10-15% |
| **Fast fashion** | [[Shein]], Temu, Primark | Ultra-low price, volume | 5-10% |
| **Athletic** | Nike, Adidas, Lululemon | Performance + lifestyle | 12-18% |
| **Department stores** | [[Saks Global]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Macy's]] | Multi-brand curation | 3-8% |

## The barbell problem

The middle is dying. The industry is bifurcating into:

| End | Who wins | Why |
|-----|----------|-----|
| **Top** | Hermès, LVMH, Cartier | Pricing power, scarcity, ultra-wealthy |
| **Bottom** | Shein, Temu, Primark | Lowest price, speed, Gen Z |
| **Middle (dying)** | Gap, J.Crew, mid-tier dept stores | No moat, squeezed both directions |

**Evidence:** Kering's Gucci (-23% in 2024) shows even luxury isn't immune when a brand loses cultural relevance and slides toward "aspirational."

## Fast fashion disruption

| Player | Model | Scale | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| **[[Shein]]** | AI-driven micro-batches, DTC | ~$30B GMV | HK IPO pending |
| **Temu (PDD)** | Ultra-low price marketplace | Growing fast | Aggressive expansion |
| **Inditex/Zara** | 2-week design-to-store | €36B revenue | Original fast fashion |
| **H&M** | Fast fashion + sustainability pivot | €24B revenue | Margin pressure |

**Shein's model:** Thousands of new SKUs daily, AI trend detection, small batch production, no inventory risk. Revolutionized speed-to-market but faces ESG backlash and regulatory scrutiny.

## Distribution channels

| Channel | Trend | Players affected |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **DTC (own stores)** | Growing — brands want control | All luxury |
| **DTC (e-commerce)** | Growing — Shein/Temu native | Fast fashion |
| **Department stores** | Declining — see [[Department store decline]] | [[Saks Global]], [[Macy's]], [[Neiman Marcus]] |
| **Wholesale** | Declining — brands pulling back | Mid-tier brands |
| **Off-price** | Stable — TJX, Ross | Value seekers |
| **Resale** | Growing — The RealReal, Vestiaire | Luxury secondary market |

## Department store crisis

The traditional multi-brand fashion retailer is in structural decline:

| Company | Status | Key issue |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [[Saks Global]] | Bankruptcy (Jan 2025) | $5B debt from Neiman acquisition |
| [[Neiman Marcus]] | Merged into Saks, then bankrupt | Second bankruptcy in 5 years |
| [[Macy's]] | Closing stores, real estate play | 150 stores closing |
| Nordstrom | Going private (2024) | Family + El Puerto de Liverpool |

## Manufacturing and supply chain

| Region | Role | Trend |
|--------|------|-------|
| **China** | Dominant manufacturer | Shein's base, de minimis loophole |
| **Bangladesh/Vietnam** | Mass market production | Low cost, labor concerns |
| **Italy/France** | Luxury production | Artisan, vertical integration (Hermès) |
| **Turkey** | Near-shoring for EU | Growing for speed |

**De minimis loophole:** Shein/Temu ship individual packages under $800 threshold, avoiding US tariffs. Under political scrutiny — potential closure would hit their model.
