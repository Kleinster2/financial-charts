# US Memory

US-based memory companies. Trades as a distinct cluster (0.50 correlation) separate from Korea Memory.

*SNDK massively outperforming since Feb 2025 spinoff (+1700%). MU and WDC more correlated with each other than with SNDK.*

## Key actors

| Company | Focus | Position |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [[Micron]] | DRAM + NAND + HBM | #3 DRAM, #4 NAND, #3 HBM |
| [[SanDisk]] | NAND (pure-play) | #5 NAND, spun from WDC Feb 2025 |
| [[Western Digital]] | HDD (post-spinoff) | Former memory, now storage |

## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.50** | Moderate (valid sector) |
| Range | 0.39 - 0.70 | WDC-SNDK to MU-WDC |
| vs [[Korea Memory]] | 0.09-0.21 | Weak (separate cluster) |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| MU - WDC | 0.70 |
| MU - SNDK | 0.42 |
| WDC - SNDK | 0.39 |

US Memory moves with US market sentiment, not Korean memory peers.

## Characteristics

| Factor | US Memory | vs Korea Memory |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| HBM exposure | Micron #3 (catching up) | SK Hynix #1, Samsung #2 |
| NAND strength | SanDisk pure-play | Kioxia JV partner |
| Geopolitical | CHIPS Act beneficiary | Export control risk |
| Currency | USD | KRW exposure |

## Investment angle

**Why separate from Korea Memory:**
- Different currency exposure
- Different policy tailwinds (CHIPS Act vs Korean industrial policy)
- Different HBM positioning (lagging vs leading)
- Correlation data confirms distinct trading behavior

**For portfolio construction:** US Memory and Korea Memory are separate bets, not interchangeable "memory exposure."
