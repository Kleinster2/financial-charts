# Mortgage REITs

Mortgage REITs (mREITs) invest in mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans. High dividend yields (10-15%) but rate-sensitive and leveraged. Two giants: Annaly (NLY) and AGNC.

## How mREITs work

**Business model:**

1. Borrow short-term (repo market)
2. Buy long-term MBS
3. Earn spread (MBS yield - funding cost)
4. Leverage amplifies returns

**Key risks:**

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Interest rate** | Rising rates hurt MBS prices |
| **Spread** | MBS spreads can widen |
| **Prepayment** | Falling rates = faster prepays |
| **Leverage** | Amplifies gains AND losses |
| **Funding** | Repo market disruptions |

## Rate environment impact

| Scenario | Impact on mREITs |
|----------|------------------|
| **Rates falling** | MBS prices rise, book value up |
| **Rates rising** | MBS prices fall, book value down |
| **Stable rates** | Carry trade works, steady dividends |
| **Inverted curve** | Funding costs exceed yields |

**Current:** Rates declining from 2023 peak — supportive for mREITs.

## MBS spread dynamics

| Metric | Value (Q3 2025) |
|--------|-----------------|
| Agency MBS OAS | +29 bps |
| vs 10-year average | ~20 bps wider |
| vs IG corporates | More attractive |

**Opportunity:** Agency MBS still cheap vs history and vs corporates.

## Dividend sustainability

**Warning signs:**
- Book value declining faster than dividends
- Leverage increasing
- Spread compression

**Healthy signs (current):**
- NLY raised dividend 7.7% in Mar 2025
- Positive economic returns
- Adequate liquidity buffers

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- High yields (12-14%)
- Rates declining
- Spreads attractive vs history
- Agency MBS = no credit risk

**Bear case:**
- Rate volatility hurts
- Leverage amplifies losses
- Prepayment risk if rates fall fast
- Complex, hard to analyze

**Best environment:** Stable or gradually declining rates with steep yield curve.
