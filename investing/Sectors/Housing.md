## Ownership breakdown

**National (all single-family homes):**

| Category | Share |
|----------|-------|
| Owner-occupied | ~65% |
| All investor-owned | ~20% |
| Small investors (1-5 homes) | 87% of investor-owned |
| Institutional (1,000+ homes) | **~3%** of SFR stock |

**But Sunbelt rental markets tell a different story (GAO/Urban Institute 2024):**

| Metro | Institutional share of **rentals** | Homes |
|-------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **Atlanta** | **25%** | 72,000 |
| Jacksonville | 21% | — |
| Charlotte | 18% | 24,000 |
| Tampa | 15% | 23,000 |
| Phoenix | — | 33,000 |
| Dallas | — | 27,000 |

**Top 6 metros = 45% of all mega-operator holdings.**

**Key insight:** National "3%" figure understates concentration in Sunbelt rental markets. Atlanta alone has 72,000 institutional-owned rentals.

## Current dynamics

**Demand:**
- Affordability crisis pushing buyers to rent
- Mortgage rates elevated → rent-vs-buy favors renting
- Housing shortage structural (underbuilding since 2008)

**Supply:**
- Homebuilders recovering but constrained
- SFR institutions net sellers for 6+ quarters
- New construction shifting to build-to-rent

**Policy:**
- [[Institutional homebuying ban]] — Trump proposal (Jan 2026)
- GSE reform discussions ongoing
- Rate cuts could shift dynamics

## Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Single-family rental]] | Asset class born from 2008 crisis |
| [[Build-to-rent]] | Purpose-built rental communities (+455% since 2019) |
| [[Housing affordability crisis]] | 75% can't afford median new home |
| [[Housing shortage]] | 3.7–7.2M unit deficit |
| [[Institutional homebuying ban]] | Trump policy proposal (Jan 2026) |
| [[GSE reform]] | Fannie/Freddie conservatorship exit |
| [[Sunbelt migration]] | Population shift driving regional demand |
| [[Mortgage rates]] | Key affordability driver (6.06% Jan 2026) |
| [[MBS market]] | Securitization, ~20% of US fixed income |

## Investment implications

**Homebuilders:**
- Housing shortage = structural tailwind
- Rate sensitivity (Fed cuts = bullish)
- Institutional buyer ban = mixed (lose bulk buyers, but less competition for retail)

**SFR REITs:**
- Regulatory overhang from ban proposals
- Rent growth moderating (~2-3%)
- Occupancy stable (~94%)

**Watch:**
- Davos details on institutional ban (late Jan 2026)
- Fed rate path
- GSE reform progress
