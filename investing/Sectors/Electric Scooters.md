# Electric Scooters

Two distinct markets under one umbrella: **personal electric two-wheelers** (seated scooters/mopeds, dominated by Asia) and **shared kick scooters** (micromobility services in Western cities). Global market ~$49B in 2025, growing 10-22% CAGR depending on segment definition. Asia Pacific accounts for ~75% of revenue.

## Market segments

### Personal ownership (seated scooters/mopeds)

The bulk of the market by revenue. Primary use case is daily commuting in dense Asian cities where cars are impractical.

| Company | Ticker | HQ | 2024 volume | Revenue | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------------|---------|-------|
| **[[Yadea]]** | 1585.HK | China | 13M units | RMB 28.2B (~$3.9B) | World's largest; 97% China revenue |
| **[[NIU Technologies]]** | NIU | China | ~800K | RMB ~3.5B | Premium positioning; stock +154% in 2025 |
| **[[Gogoro]]** | GGR | Taiwan | Declining | $310M (2024) | Battery-swapping pioneer; 90% of Taiwan EV scooters |
| **[[Ather Energy]]** | ATHERENERG.NS | India | ~160K | ₹2,854 Cr | Hero-backed; IPO'd Apr 2025; still loss-making |
| Hero Electric | Private | India | — | — | Volume leader in India |
| Segway-Ninebot | Private | China | — | — | Consumer + shared fleet |

**China dominance:** Yadea alone sells more than the next 20 brands combined. Chinese manufacturers (Yadea, AIMA, NIU, Tailg) control the global supply chain for motors, batteries, and controllers.

### Shared micromobility (kick scooters + e-bikes)

Stand-up kick scooters rented by the minute in urban areas. Asset-heavy, low-margin, high regulatory risk.

| Company | Status | Revenue | Key metric |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Lime** | Private (IPO expected 2026) | $686M net rev (2024) | 270K+ vehicle fleet, FCF positive 2 consecutive years |
| **Tier/Dott** | Merged 2022 | Undisclosed | European focus |
| **Bird** | **Bankrupt** (Dec 2023) | — | Cautionary tale |
| [[Lyft]] | Bikes/scooters segment | Minority of rev | 47% surge in e-bike trips (2025) |

**Unit economics:** Lime proved the model can work — $810M gross bookings in 2024 (+30% YoY), adjusted EBITDA positive since 2022. But Bird's bankruptcy shows the margin for error is razor-thin. Key variables: vehicle lifespan, maintenance cost, utilization rate, regulatory stability.

## What makes the sector work

### Personal ownership flywheel (Asia)

1. **Density + regulation** — Asian cities ban or restrict motorcycles/cars in urban cores, creating captive demand
2. **Battery cost deflation** — lithium cell prices falling makes EVs cheaper than ICE two-wheelers on TCO
3. **Charging infrastructure** — home charging works for <50km daily range; battery-swap (Gogoro model) solves range anxiety
4. **Government mandates** — China's "new national standards" (2019) force upgrade from lead-acid to lithium, driving replacement cycle

### Shared micromobility economics

| Variable | Good | Bad |
|----------|------|-----|
| Vehicle lifespan | 24+ months | <12 months (early Bird) |
| Daily utilization | 4+ rides/day | <2 rides/day |
| Maintenance cost | <$0.50/ride | >$2/ride |
| Regulatory environment | Stable permits | Sudden bans |

## Key dynamics

### Battery-swapping vs. charging

Gogoro pioneered the battery-swap model: riders subscribe (~$30/month), swap depleted batteries for charged ones at kiosks in 6 seconds. Over 648K subscribers in Taiwan, 1M+ batteries in service, more swap stations than gas stations in major cities. Five of the top six Taiwan scooter makers use Gogoro's network.

**The bet:** Gogoro expects battery-swap business to reach profitability (non-IFRS) in 2026. Energy revenue now exceeds vehicle sales — recurring SaaS-like revenue.

**China JV:** Yadea + Gogoro + DCJ formed $50M JV to bring battery-swap to China. If successful, huge TAM expansion.

### China replacement cycle

China's 2019 national standards forced a technology upgrade across ~300M registered two-wheelers. This created a multi-year replacement wave that peaked in 2023-2024 (Yadea: 16.5M units in 2023), then pulled back in 2024 (-21% volume) as the initial surge exhausted. H1 2025 shows recovery (+38% volume) suggesting a new growth phase or stimulus effect.

### India: emerging battleground

India has ~200M two-wheelers (mostly ICE). EV penetration is low (<5%) but growing fast. Ather Energy's IPO signals market maturity. Hero MotoCorp (world's largest motorcycle maker) invested in Ather. Risk: Chinese components dominate the supply chain, echoing [[China battery leverage]] dynamics.

## Investable landscape

| Ticker | Segment | Market cap | Bull case | Bear case |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1585.HK** | Personal/China | HK$40B | World's largest, profit doubling, consensus Strong Buy | 97% China exposure, replacement cycle fading |
| **NIU** | Personal/China | ~$500M | Premium brand, sales +50% YoY, international expansion | Tiny vs Yadea, unprofitable until Q2 2025 |
| **GGR** | Infra/Taiwan | ~$50M | Swap network is a platform, JV with Yadea, path to profitability | Revenue declining, micro-cap, potential reverse split |
| **ATHERENERG** | Personal/India | ₹24K Cr | India EV penetration tailwind, Hero backing | Still loss-making (₹-764Cr), new public co |
| **Lime** (pre-IPO) | Shared/Global | TBD (2020: $510M) | First profitable micromobility co, IPO 2026, Goldman/JPM | E-bike maintenance costs, regulatory risk |

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Regulatory whiplash** | Cities can ban shared scooters overnight (Paris 2023 referendum) |
| **Chinese price war** | Yadea/AIMA compete on volume, compressing margins |
| **Battery safety** | Fires from cheap lithium packs = regulatory crackdowns |
| **Seasonal demand** | Northern markets see 50%+ winter ridership drops |
| **Vandalism/theft** | Shared fleet operators face 15-30% annual fleet loss |
| **EV car competition** | As car EVs get cheaper, scooter value prop weakens for some segments |
