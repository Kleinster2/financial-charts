# Drones

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) — military, commercial, and consumer applications.

## Market segments

| Segment | Key players | Use cases |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Military** | [[Norinco]], [[General Atomics]], [[Northrop Grumman]], Turkish Aerospace | ISR, strike, logistics |
| **Cargo/logistics** | [[Zipline]], [[Wing]], Amazon, [[Norinco]] | Delivery, resupply |
| **Commercial/industrial** | [[DJI]], [[Skydio]], Autel | Inspection, mapping, agriculture |
| **Consumer** | [[DJI]], Autel, Parrot | Photography, hobby |
| **Air taxi/eVTOL** | [[Ehang]], [[Joby Aviation]], [[Archer Aviation]], Lilium | Urban air mobility |

## Cargo drones / aerial logistics

Autonomous aerial delivery — ranges from last-mile (small packages) to heavy cargo (1+ ton payloads).

| Company | Country | Payload | Focus |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| [[Wing]] (Alphabet) | US | Small | Last-mile delivery |
| [[Zipline]] | US | Medical | Blood, vaccines (Africa, US) |
| **Amazon Prime Air** | US | Small | E-commerce delivery |
| [[Norinco]] (Tianma-1000) | China | **1 ton** | Heavy cargo, military logistics |
| [[Ehang]] | China | Passengers | Air taxi |

### Tianma-1000 (天马-1000) — Jan 2026

First flight January 11, 2026. Heavy cargo drone from [[Norinco]] subsidiary Xi'an ASN.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Payload | 1 ton |
| Range | 1,800 km |
| Ceiling | 8,000 m |
| Takeoff | <200 m |

**Dual-use:** Civilian framing (remote resupply, disaster relief) but military-grade specs. Short-field, high-altitude, modular airdrop = battlefield logistics.

**Strategic divergence:** China building heavy cargo drone capability while US focuses on last-mile. Different use cases — China optimizing for contested/remote terrain logistics.

## Military drones

| Type | Examples | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| MALE (Medium-altitude long-endurance) | MQ-9 Reaper, Wing Loong | ISR, strike |
| HALE (High-altitude long-endurance) | RQ-4 Global Hawk | Strategic ISR |
| Tactical | Bayraktar TB2, Switchblade | Battlefield ISR, loitering munitions |
| Cargo | Tianma-1000 | Logistics, resupply |

**Ukraine lessons:** Cheap drones (FPV, Bayraktar) reshaping warfare. See [[Ukraine war]].

## Commercial/industrial

| Company | HQ | Specialty | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| [[DJI]] | China | Consumer, commercial | ~70% global market share |
| [[Skydio]] | US | Autonomous flight | US government preferred |
| **Autel** | China | Consumer, enterprise | DJI competitor |
| **Parrot** | France | Defense pivot | Exiting consumer |

**DJI dominance:** Chinese company controls most of global drone market. US government agencies increasingly restricted from using DJI (security concerns).

## Regulatory landscape

| Region | Framework | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| US | FAA Part 107, BVLOS waivers | Expanding commercial ops |
| EU | EASA drone regulations | Harmonized 2024 |
| China | CAAC | Permissive for domestic |

**Key barrier:** Beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) approval still difficult in US/EU. Limits cargo drone scale.

## Investment vehicles

| Company | Ticker | Angle |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [[Joby Aviation]] | JOBY | Air taxi |
| [[Archer Aviation]] | ACHR | Air taxi |
| [[AeroVironment]] | AVAV | Military small UAVs |
| [[Ehang]] | EH | Air taxi (China) |
| **Kratos Defense** | KTOS | Military drones |

**Private:** [[Zipline]], [[Wing]] (Alphabet), [[Skydio]], [[DJI]]
