# Insurance

The insurance sector spans P&C, life/annuity, health, reinsurance, and broking. The defining structural shift of the 2020s is the [[PE-insurance convergence]] — private equity firms acquiring insurers for [[Permanent capital]], transforming the industry's economics.

## The PE-insurance revolution

**The biggest structural shift in insurance since the GFC.**

Every major PE firm now owns an insurer. Why?
1. **[[Permanent capital]]** — no fundraising cycles, no redemptions
2. **Cost of capital arbitrage** — annuity liabilities at 3-4% vs. PE fund hurdles of 15-20%
3. **Fee income** — ~1.4% on originated assets vs. ~0.4% on traditional AUM
4. **$51T retirement gap** — secular demand for annuity products

**The flywheel:** Issue annuities → collect long-duration premiums → PE sponsor invests float in [[Private credit]] → spread income + management fees → repeat.

**Scale:** 139 PE-owned US insurers (Jun 2025, NAIC). $928B US life/health ceded to Bermuda (up from $205B in 2014).

Traditional insurers ([[MetLife]], [[Prudential Financial]]) are responding: either shedding blocks to PE platforms or building competing models (Prudential's Prismic Life sidecar).

## Business models by sub-sector

### P&C economics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Combined ratio** | Losses + expenses / premiums (<100% = underwriting profit) |
| **Float** | Premiums held before claims paid (Berkshire model) |
| **Catastrophe exposure** | Unpredictable hurricane/wildfire losses |
| **Hard/soft cycle** | Pricing power rotates with industry losses |

Currently in **hard market** — commercial rate increases ~10%, combined ratios improving.

### Life/annuity economics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Spread income** | Investment return minus crediting rate |
| **Surrender charges** | Lock-in mechanism for annuity holders |
| **Duration matching** | Asset/liability duration alignment |
| **Float duration** | 20-30 years (vs. P&C: 1-3 years) |

PE-owned platforms earn spread by investing in private credit/alternatives rather than treasuries.

### Health insurance economics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Medical loss ratio (MLR)** | Claims / premiums (regulated ~85%, ACA) |
| **Star ratings** | Medicare Advantage quality scores |
| **PBM spread** | Pharmacy benefit pricing arbitrage |
| **Services diversification** | Optum (UNH), Carelon (ELV), Evernorth (CI) |

### Broker economics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fee-based, capital-light** | No risk-taking, pure intermediation |
| **Organic growth** | Rate increases flow through as higher premiums brokered |
| **Retention rates** | 90%+ (sticky clients) |
| **Reinsurance placement** | Guy Carpenter/Aon place business with reinsurers |
