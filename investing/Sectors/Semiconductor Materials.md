# Semiconductor Materials

The chemicals, gases, and substrates that enable chip manufacturing. Japan dominates critical segments — a chokepoint as strategic as equipment.

---

## Why materials matter

Every chip requires ~600 process steps using hundreds of specialized materials. Unlike equipment (where the US and Netherlands have leverage), **Japan controls the materials stack**:

| Material | Japan share | Key players |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **EUV photoresists** | ~90% | [[JSR Corporation]], [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]], [[Shin-Etsu]] |
| **Silicon wafers** | ~55% | [[Shin-Etsu]], [[Sumco]] |
| **Photomasks** | ~70% | Dai Nippon, Toppan |
| **CMP slurries** | ~40% | Fujimi, CMC Materials |
| **Specialty gases** | ~50% | Taiyo Nippon Sanso |

This is the "other chokepoint" — less discussed than [[ASML]] but equally critical.

## Market structure

| Segment | Size (2024) | Growth | Concentration |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Photoresists** | ~$5B | 5-6% CAGR | Top 7 = 86% |
| **Silicon wafers** | ~$14B | 4-5% CAGR | Top 5 = 93% |
| **CMP slurries** | ~$2.5B | 6-7% CAGR | Top 4 = 75% |
| **Wet chemicals** | ~$3B | 5% CAGR | Fragmented |
| **Specialty gases** | ~$8B | 7% CAGR | Top 5 = 60% |

Total semiconductor materials market: ~$65-70B annually.

## Photoresists (deep dive)

The light-sensitive chemicals that transfer circuit patterns onto silicon. **The most concentrated segment.**

### EUV photoresist market share

| Company | Share | Status | Ticker |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| [[JSR Corporation]] | ~27% | Private (JIC) | — |
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | ~20-25% | Public | 4186.T |
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~15% | Public (diversified) | 4063.T |
| [[Fujifilm]] | ~10% | Public (diversified) | 4901.T |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | ~8% | Public (diversified) | 4005.T |
| [[Qnity]] | ~7% | Public | Q |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | ~5% | Public (diversified) | MRK.DE |

**Japan dominance:** JSR + TOK + Shin-Etsu = ~90% of EUV photoresists.

### Photoresist types

| Type | Node | Trend |
|------|------|-------|
| **EUV** | 7nm and below | Fastest growth (25%+ CAGR) |
| **ArF immersion** | 7nm-14nm | Stable, bread and butter |
| **KrF** | 28nm+ | Mature, declining |
| **i-line** | Legacy | Stable (automotive, IoT) |

### Why EUV photoresists are hard

- Must absorb EUV light (13.5nm wavelength) efficiently
- Extreme sensitivity requirements
- Outgassing constraints (vacuum environment)
- Line edge roughness challenges
- Decades of R&D required

## Silicon wafers

Every chip starts as a silicon wafer. Another Japan-dominated segment.

| Company | Share | HQ | Ticker |
|---------|-------|-----|--------|
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | ~30% | Japan | 4063.T |
| [[Sumco]] | ~25% | Japan | 3436.T |
| [[Siltronic]] | ~13% | Germany | WAF.DE |
| SK Siltron | ~12% | Korea | — |
| Others | ~20% | — | — |

**Japan dominance:** Shin-Etsu + Sumco = 55% of global wafers.

## Investment angles

### Pure-play options

| Company | Ticker | Focus | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]] | 4186.T | Photoresists | Best pure-play (JSR now private) |
| [[Qnity]] | Q | Semi materials | US pure-play, DuPont spin |
| [[Sumco]] | 3436.T | Wafers | Japan, pure-play |
| [[Siltronic]] | WAF.DE | Wafers | Germany |

### Diversified exposure

| Company | Ticker | Semi % | Other businesses |
|---------|--------|--------|------------------|
| [[Shin-Etsu]] | 4063.T | ~45% | PVC, silicones |
| [[Fujifilm]] | 4901.T | ~15% | Healthcare dominant |
| [[Sumitomo Chemical]] | 4005.T | ~15% | Petrochemicals, pharma |
| [[Merck KGaA]] | MRK.DE | ~18% | Healthcare, life science |

## Sector KPIs

| Metric | Good | Why it matters |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Gross margin** | >40% | Specialty chemicals pricing power |
| **R&D intensity** | >8% | Next-gen materials development |
| **Customer concentration** | <30% | Risk diversification |
| **Japan revenue %** | Track | Proxy for leading-edge exposure |

## Current themes (2025-2026)

| Theme | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **EUV adoption** | Photoresist demand growing 25%+ CAGR |
| **JSR privatization** | Japan protecting strategic assets |
| **High-NA EUV** | New resist formulations needed |
| **Advanced packaging** | New material requirements (substrates, underfill) |
| **China localization** | Attempting domestic materials, limited success |
| **Sustainability** | PFAS-free, low-GWP alternatives |

## Geopolitics

### Japan's materials leverage

Japan hasn't weaponized materials like the US weaponizes equipment — but it could:

| Precedent | Date | Target | Materials |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|
| Japan-Korea dispute | July 2019 | Korea | Photoresists, HF, fluorinated polyimide |

The 2019 restrictions (over wartime labor disputes) briefly disrupted Samsung/SK Hynix. Demonstrated Japan's latent leverage.

### China localization efforts

- **Progress:** Limited. EUV photoresists require decades of tacit knowledge.
- **Challenge:** Not just chemistry — need clean room expertise, quality control, customer qualification.
- **Timeline:** 5-10+ years to meaningful domestic supply, if ever.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Cyclicality** | Follows chip cycle with 6-12 month lag |
| **Yen exposure** | Japan-heavy, currency volatility |
| **Customer concentration** | TSMC, Samsung dominate demand |
| **Technology shifts** | New lithography could obsolete resists |
| **China retaliation** | Rare earth restrictions on Japan possible |

---

## Sub-sectors

| Sub-sector | Key players | Sister concept |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Photoresists** | [[JSR Corporation]], [[Tokyo Ohka Kogyo]], [[Shin-Etsu]], [[Dongjin Semichem]] | [[Photoresists]] |
| **Silicon wafers** | [[Shin-Etsu]], [[Sumco]], [[Siltronic]] | — |
| **CMP slurries** | [[Entegris]], [[Fujimi]], [[Fujifilm]] | — |
| **Specialty gases** | [[Taiyo Nippon Sanso]], [[Air Liquide]] | — |

## Investment theses

- [[Long Japan photoresists]] — Japan 90% EUV share, TOK as primary vehicle
- [[Long Japan wafers]] — Japan 55% wafer share, Sumco as pure-play
