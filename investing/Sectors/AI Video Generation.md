## Competitive landscape

### Western leaders

**[[Runway]]** — First mover, strongest Hollywood relationships. Gen-4.5 tops Video Arena leaderboard. AMC Networks deal (Walking Dead, Interview with the Vampire). Lionsgate partnership. Hundred Film Fund ($5M+) for filmmakers. AI Film Festival grew to 6,000+ submissions, screened at Lincoln Center with IMAX.

**[[Luma AI]]** — Ray3 is the first "reasoning" video model — generates physically accurate videos in true HDR. $900M round led by Saudi HUMAIN for access to 2GW AI supercluster. Deployed inside [[Adobe]] products. 30M+ Dream Machine users.

**[[Pika Labs]]** — Most consumer-friendly. Founded April 2023 by Stanford PhD dropouts Demi Guo and Chenlin Meng. Enterprise growing to ~40% of revenue. [[Meta]] reportedly in active acquisition talks (~$500M).

### Big tech entrants

**[[OpenAI]] Sora** — Sora 2 launched September 2025. [[Disney]] invested $1B in OpenAI with 3-year Sora licensing deal. But costs are "completely unsustainable" per Head of Sora Bill Peebles — estimated $15M/day. Installs fell 45% MoM in January 2026.

**[[Google]] Veo** — Veo 3.1 is first mainstream model with true 4K output. Native vertical video, synchronized audio (dialogue + SFX). SynthID watermarking for provenance. Integrated into Google AI Pro ($19.99/mo) and Ultra ($249.99/mo).

### China

**[[Kling AI]]** ([[Kuaishou]]) — Arguably the most remarkable growth story: **$240M ARR in 19 months** post-launch. 60M+ creators, 600M+ videos generated. ~70% of revenue from individual subs outside China. Rapid iteration — Kling 3.0 (Feb 2026) does 15-second cinematic, native 4K, multi-shot storyboards with unified audio-visual generation. Pricing aggressive: free tier + $6.99–$180/mo paid.

## Open-source vs closed

| Approach | Players | Tradeoff |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Closed** | Runway, Pika, Sora, Veo, Kling | Better quality, monetizable |
| **Open-source** | [[Stability AI]], [[Lightricks]] (LTX-2), CogVideo | Community adoption, commoditization risk |

[[Stability AI]] Stable Video Diffusion: 231K monthly downloads on Hugging Face. Partnerships with [[Electronic Arts]], [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music Group]].

[[Lightricks]] released LTXV-13B (May 2025) and LTX-2 (Oct 2025) as open-source. Integrated Google's Veo 3 into [[LTX Studio]].

## Economics

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Training cost | $10M–$100M+ per frontier model |
| Inference cost | Sora: ~$15M/day (unsustainable) |
| Pricing | $8–$250/mo consumer; enterprise negotiated |
| Revenue model | Subscription + API credits |
| Margin profile | Negative at frontier (GPU-bound); improving |

**Kling's efficiency** is notable — profitable growth at much lower price points than Western competitors, suggesting either architectural advantages or willingness to subsidize.

---

## IP licensing — the emerging model

| Deal | Structure |
|------|-----------|
| [[Disney]]–[[OpenAI]] | $1B investment + 3-year Sora licensing for Disney IP |
| [[AMC Networks]]–[[Runway]] | Pre-viz and marketing across AMC slate |
| [[Fable Studios]]–unnamed studio | Revenue split on sanctioned AI IP use |
| [[Moonvalley]] | Trained exclusively on licensed content |

Studios are shifting from "fight AI" to "monetize IP through AI" — licensing rather than litigating.

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Frontier model race | [[Runway]] (private), [[Luma AI]] (private), [[Pika Labs]] (private) |
| Big tech integration | [[Google]], [[OpenAI]], [[Adobe]] |
| China competition | [[Kuaishou]] (01024.HK) |
| Compute demand | [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] (GPU supply for training) |
| Open-source commoditization | [[Stability AI]] (private), [[Lightricks]] (private) |

**Public exposure** is limited — most pure-play companies are private. Best proxies: Kuaishou (HKEx: 01024) for Kling, [[NVIDIA]] for picks-and-shovels, [[Adobe]] for tool integration.

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Copyright litigation** | Training on copyrighted video remains legally contested |
| **Unsustainable unit economics** | Sora's $15M/day cost illustrates the inference problem |
| **Commoditization** | Open-source models eroding paid tier value |
| **Platform risk** | Big tech (Google, OpenAI) could commoditize standalone players |
| **China competition** | Kling's pricing pressure on Western margins |
| **Quality plateau** | Current models still struggle with physics, consistency |

## Timeline to watch

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2025 H2 | Meta potential Pika acquisition (~$500M) |
| 2026 | Runway targeting $300M ARR |
| 2026 | Fable Studios first AI movie (*Everything Is Fine*) |
| 2026 | Disney–Sora content expected |
| 2027+ | Real-time generation at consumer scale? |
