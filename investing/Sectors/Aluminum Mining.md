**Aluminum Mining** — The industry that mines bauxite, refines alumina, and smelts primary aluminum. China dominates (~60% of production) but has capped capacity. See [[Aluminum]] for the commodity itself.

---

## Industry structure

**Vertically integrated:** Most major producers control the full chain:
1. **Bauxite mining** — Ore extraction (Guinea, Australia, Indonesia)
2. **Alumina refining** — Bauxite → alumina (intermediate)
3. **Primary smelting** — Alumina → aluminum metal (energy-intensive)
4. **Downstream** — Rolling, extrusion, fabrication

## Recent M&A (Jan 2026)

### Chinalco acquiring CBA

- **Target:** [[Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio|CBA]] — Brazil's largest (480K tonnes/year, low-carbon)
- **Seller:** [[Votorantim]] (69% stake)
- **Structure:** Buy control stake, then mandatory tender for minorities
- **Value:** ~$1.15B market cap (stock up 95%+ on speculation)
- **Failed bidder:** [[Emirates Global Aluminium]] (discussions slowed)
- **Status:** "Within days or weeks" of announcement (Jan 2026)

**Strategic logic:** Chinalco securing non-China supply as domestic capacity capped. Similar playbook to Guinea bauxite investments.

---

## Supply chain dynamics

### Bauxite

Guinea dominates seaborne trade — 80% of China's bauxite imports.

**Emerging suppliers:**
- **Sierra Leone:** 5M tonnes 2025 → 7M tonnes 2026
- **Cameroon:** Minim Martap project (6M tonnes by Q1 2026)

**Risk:** Guinea political instability could disrupt global supply.

### Alumina

**New capacity (2025-2027):** 30M+ tonnes coming online in China, Indonesia, India.

**Indonesia buildup:**
- Mempawah SGAR: 1M tonnes (Sept 2024)
- Jinjiang Group: 1M tonnes (early 2025)
- Nanshan Group: 2M tonnes (2025-2026)
- Target: 10M tonnes capacity by 2027

**Supply disruptions:**
- Alcoa Kwinana refinery closure (Australia)
- Rio Tinto Queensland force majeure

### Primary aluminum

China's 45M tonne cap is binding — no more incremental Chinese supply.

**Non-China additions:**
- Indonesia: 1.4M tonnes (2026)
- EGA recycling plant: 170K tonnes (Q1 2026)
- EGA Oklahoma (USA): First new US smelter since 1980 (end of decade)

## Investment considerations

### Bull case

- China capacity capped — supply constrained
- Energy transition demand (solar, EVs, grid)
- Green aluminum premium expanding
- Low-cost producers (Hydro, EGA) well-positioned

### Bear case

- China slowdown (still ~50% of demand)
- Energy costs volatile (smelters are price takers)
- Indonesian capacity surge
- Alumina oversupply emerging
- Substitution from steel/composites at high prices

### Key metrics to watch

| Metric | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| LME aluminum price | Revenue driver |
| China output vs cap | Supply tightness |
| Energy costs | Margin driver |
| Alumina/bauxite spreads | Input costs |
| Indonesia ramp-up | New supply |

---

## Decarbonization

Aluminum smelting is carbon-intensive (coal power in China). **Green aluminum** (hydro/renewable powered) commands premium.

**Leaders:**
- **Norsk Hydro** — Hydro-powered (Norway)
- **Rio Tinto** — Canadian hydro operations
- **CBA** — Low-carbon positioning (Brazil hydro)
- **EGA** — Solar/nuclear ambitions (UAE)

**Policy:** EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) affects trade flows — penalizes high-carbon imports starting 2026.
