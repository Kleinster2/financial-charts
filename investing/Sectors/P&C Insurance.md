## Business model

| Factor | P&C Insurance |
|--------|---------------|
| Revenue | Premiums + investment income |
| Liabilities | Short-duration (1-3 years) |
| Key metric | Combined ratio (<100% = profit) |
| Cycle | Hard/soft pricing cycle |
| Risk | Catastrophe exposure |

---

## Why market-uncorrelated

P&C trades on:
- Underwriting profitability (loss ratios)
- Catastrophe losses (hurricanes, wildfires)
- Pricing cycle (hard market = higher premiums)
- Reserve development

NOT on:
- GDP growth
- Tech earnings
- Consumer spending

This makes P&C a natural hedge against growth/tech exposure.

## Outliers

| Stock | Correlation | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| PGR (Progressive) | 0.33-0.68 | Auto-focused, different cycle |

Progressive is more correlated with auto cycle than commercial P&C.
