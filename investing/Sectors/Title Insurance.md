## How title insurance works

### The product

| Type | Purpose | Required? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Lender's policy** | Protects mortgage lender | Yes (lender requires) |
| **Owner's policy** | Protects buyer's equity | Optional |

**One-time premium** at closing — not annual like other insurance. Covers unknown defects that existed before purchase:
- Outstanding liens (unpaid taxes, contractor liens)
- Errors in deeds
- Fraud/forgery
- Undisclosed heirs
- Easements, encumbrances

### The process

1. Contract signed → title company receives copy
2. **Title search** — examine public records for chain of ownership
3. Identify liens/encumbrances that need clearing
4. Issue title commitment
5. **Closing** — title company facilitates, collects premium
6. Policy issued

**Agent model:** Most title insurance sold through local agents, not direct. Agents do search/closing work, underwriters bear risk.

## Market structure

### The Big Four (~80% share)

| Company | Q1 2025 Share | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **[[Fidelity National Financial]]** | 27% (combined) | FNF | #1 overall (includes Chicago Title) |
| **[[First American Financial]]** | 22.9% | FAF | #1 individual underwriter |
| **[[Old Republic International]]** | 14% | ORI | Diversified insurer |
| **[[Stewart Information Services]]** | 9.2% | STC | #4, lost share since 2019 |

**Fidelity brands:** Fidelity National Title, Chicago Title (12.9%), Commonwealth Land Title, Alamo Title.

### Independent underwriters (the counter-trend)

**Independents gained share:** 15% combined (2019) → **26.9%** (2024). Big Four losing ground to agent-centric models.

| Company | Share | Model | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| [[Westcor Land Title]] | 4.2% | Agent-only | Never competes with agents |
| [[Title Resources]] | 3.1% | Agent-focused | Acquired [[Doma Holdings]] (2024) |
| [[WFG National Title]] | 2.7% | Direct + Agency | Founded by ex-FNF President |
| [[Alliant National]] | ~1% | Agent-only | Acquired by [[Dream Finders Homes]] (Apr 2025) |

**Why independents win:**
- No channel conflict (Big Four direct operations compete with their own agents)
- Agent-centric underwriting (relationships over scale)
- Technology absorption (Title Resources/Doma)

### Competitive dynamics

| Barrier | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| State licensing | Required in each state |
| Relationships | Deep ties to agents, lenders, realtors |
| Data assets | Decades of title/property records |
| Scale | Local presence + national footprint |
| Regulation | State-regulated rates in some markets |

**Market structure:** Big Four dominate but **independents gaining**. Combined independent share doubled 2019-2024.

## Revenue drivers

| Driver | Sensitivity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Home purchase volume** | Primary driver |
| **Mortgage rates** | Affects refi volume |
| **Home prices** | Premium = % of price |
| **Commercial real estate** | Growing segment |

**Cyclicality:** Highly tied to housing transactions. Low rates = refi boom. High rates = volume collapse.

### 2025 environment

| Segment | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Residential purchase | Recovering (+17% orders at FAF) |
| Refinance | Weak (high rates) |
| Commercial | Strong (+29-34% at majors) |

---

## Technology transformation

**Digital closing platforms:**
- Remote online notarization (RON)
- E-closing
- AI-powered title search
- Automation reducing manual work

**Leaders:**
- [[Fidelity National Financial]]: SoftPro, inHere platform — **17.8% margins** (record)
- [[First American Financial]]: Proprietary digital tools

**Result:** Record margins even in weak volume environment. Technology = operating leverage.

---

## Regulatory landscape (2025)

### FinCEN rules
New anti-money laundering requirements:
- Nationwide reporting (expanded from high-cost markets)
- Lower reporting thresholds
- Settlement agents now have obligations

**Impact:** Compliance costs, but also barrier to smaller players.

### State rate regulation
Some states regulate title insurance rates — limits pricing power but also limits competition.

---

## Investment thesis

### Bull case
- Oligopoly with 80%+ share — stable, defensible
- Technology driving margin expansion
- Housing recovery = volume upside
- Commercial strength offsetting residential weakness
- Regulatory complexity = barrier to entry

### Bear case
- Cyclical — tied to housing transactions
- Rate sensitivity (refi business)
- Digital disruption risk long-term
- Regulatory scrutiny (Treasury exploring reforms)
- Limited pricing power (regulated rates)

### Key metrics to watch
- Mortgage origination volume
- Home sales (existing + new)
- Pretax margins
- Market share stability
- Commercial real estate activity
