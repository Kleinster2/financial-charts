# US Sports Betting & iGaming

Post-[[PASPA]] regulated sports wagering and online casino gaming in the United States. From zero legal states (outside Nevada) in May 2018 to 39 states with some form of legal sports betting by early 2026. The fastest-growing segment of US commercial gaming, driven by mobile-first platforms, state-by-state legalization, and a structural shift from illegal to regulated markets.

## Market size & growth

### Sports betting

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025E |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| Total handle (wagered) | ~$93B | ~$120B | ~$150B | ~$165B |
| Gross gaming revenue (GGR) | ~$7.5B | ~$11.0B | ~$13.7B | ~$16-18B |
| National hold rate | 8.1% | 9.1% | ~9.5% | ~10%+ |
| State tax revenue | ~$1.6B | ~$2.1B | ~$2.8B | ~$3.3B+ |
| Parlay share of handle | ~25% | ~30% | ~33% | 35%+ |

Handle represents total amount wagered. GGR is the operator's take (handle minus payouts). The rising hold rate reflects the growing share of parlays and same-game parlays, which carry structurally higher margins for sportsbooks.

The US sports betting market was valued at approximately $17.9B in 2024 (Grand View Research) and is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~11% through 2030, reaching $33B+. Growth drivers: new state launches, mobile penetration within existing states, product innovation (micro-betting, parlays), and major sporting events (2026 FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl LX).

### iGaming (online casino)

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | 2025E |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Revenue (7 active states) | ~$6.5B | $8.4B | ~$10.8B |
| YoY growth | ~25% | 29% | ~28-30% |
| Mobile share | ~68% | ~70% | ~72% |

iGaming is growing faster than sports betting and carries higher margins. Only 7 states allow full online casino: [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Michigan]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Rhode Island]]. Nevada permits online poker only.

New Jersey is the most mature market: $2.91B in iGaming revenue in 2025 (+22% YoY) -- the first year internet gaming revenue exceeded land-based casino revenue in the state.

### Total US commercial gaming

Total US commercial gaming revenue approached $60B through the first nine months of 2025, on track for a fourth consecutive record year. This includes land-based casinos, sports betting, and iGaming.

## Legalization timeline

### PASPA repeal and aftermath

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), enacted in 1992, effectively banned sports betting nationwide outside of Nevada (with narrow exemptions for Delaware, Oregon, and Montana). New Jersey challenged the law starting in 2011 after voters approved a constitutional amendment. The case, Murphy v. NCAA, reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 7-2 on May 14, 2018 that PASPA was unconstitutional as it commandeered state regulatory power. The decision opened the floodgates for state-by-state legalization.

### State adoption timeline

| Year | States launched | Cumulative | Notable |
|------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| Pre-2018 | Nevada | 1 | Grandfathered under PASPA |
| 2018 | Delaware, NJ, MS, WV, PA, RI, NM | 8 | NJ first with mobile + remote registration |
| 2019 | AR, IN, IA, OR, MT, NH | 14 | |
| 2020 | CO, IL, MI, TN, VA, WA | 20 | COVID accelerated mobile adoption |
| 2021 | AZ, CT, FL*, LA, MD, SD, WY, NC (retail) | 28 | NY authorized |
| 2022 | NY, KS, OH, MA, ME | 33 | NY instant #1 handle state |
| 2023 | KY, NC (mobile), VT | 36 | |
| 2024 | DC expanded | 37 | |
| 2025 | MO | 38-39 | Missouri launched Dec 1 |

*Florida status contested -- the [[Seminole Tribe]] compact includes mobile betting via their Hard Rock Bet app, but legal challenges continue.

### Current status (Feb 2026)

- 39 states have some form of legal sports betting (including DC and Puerto Rico)
- 30 states offer online/mobile sports betting
- 7 states allow iGaming (online casino)
- 11 states still prohibit sports betting entirely: Alabama, Alaska, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah

### Key holdout states

| State | Population | Status | Outlook |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| California | 39M | No legal sports betting | 2022 ballot measures defeated ($460M spent); tribal sovereignty is key barrier; 2028 ballot most realistic timeline |
| Texas | 30M | No legal sports betting | 2025 bills stalled; Lt. Gov. [[Dan Patrick]] opposed; biennial legislature means no session in 2026 |
| Georgia | 11M | No legal sports betting | Senate passed bill 2024 but House blocked; possible 2026 |
| Florida | 22M | Tribal-only (disputed) | [[Seminole Tribe]] compact; Hard Rock Bet app operational but legal challenges ongoing |
| Hawaii | 1.4M | No legal sports betting | Likeliest to legalize in 2026; House and Senate passed versions of HB 1308 in 2025 but conference committee failed |

California and Texas together represent ~70M people and would likely generate $20B+ in annual handle. Their absence is the single largest remaining growth opportunity.

## Market structure & operator landscape

### The duopoly

[[FanDuel]] (owned by [[Flutter Entertainment]], NYSE: FLUT) and [[DraftKings]] (NASDAQ: DKNG) collectively control ~70-75% of US online sports betting GGR. Both converted their daily fantasy sports (DFS) user bases into sportsbook customers after PASPA repeal.

### Operator market share (2024-2025)

| Operator | Parent | GGR share | Handle share | States live | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| [[FanDuel]] | [[Flutter Entertainment]] | ~40-43% | ~34% | 23 | #1 by GGR; 14.5% structural hold (Q4 2024) |
| [[DraftKings]] | Public (DKNG) | ~33-36% | ~34% | 26 | Most states; 10.5% structural hold |
| [[BetMGM]] | [[MGM Resorts]] / [[Entain]] JV | ~8-13% | ~8% | 30 | #1 in iGaming (21% share); FY2025 revenue $2.8B |
| [[Fanatics]] | Private | ~7-8% | ~7% | 24 + DC | Fastest-growing; 0% to 8% in 2 years |
| [[Caesars Digital]] | [[Caesars Entertainment]] | ~5% | ~5% | 20+ | Potential spinoff; $500M EBITDA target |
| ESPN Bet/theScore | [[Penn Entertainment]] | ~3% | ~3% | 19 | ESPN deal terminated Nov 2025; rebranded to theScore Bet Dec 2025 |

### Operator financial summary (most recent full year or LTM)

| Operator | Revenue | Adj. EBITDA | Net income | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Flutter US (FanDuel) | ~$7.2B (2025 guide) | ~$1.3B (2025 guide) | N/A (segment) | EBITDA-positive since 2023 |
| DraftKings | ~$5.9-6.1B (2025 guide) | $450-550M (2025 guide, reduced from $900M-1B) | ~-$268M (LTM Sep 2025) | First positive adj. EBITDA year in 2024 ($181M) |
| BetMGM | $2.8B (FY2025) | $220M (FY2025) | $175M | First profitable year; $464M EBITDA improvement YoY |
| Caesars Digital | ~$1.3B (2025E annualized) | ~$200M+ (2025E) | N/A (segment) | Targeting $500M EBITDA run rate by end 2025 |
| Penn Entertainment (digital) | ~$1.2B (2025E) | -$76.6M (Q3 2025 digital) | N/A | ESPN Bet disappointed; pivoting to theScore Bet + iGaming |
| Fanatics B&G | ~$300M (2024) | Loss-making | Loss-making | Projecting $300M loss in 2025, $150M in 2026, profitable by 2027 |

### The ESPN Bet debacle

[[Penn Entertainment]] paid $150M/year to ESPN for the ESPN Bet brand (10-year deal, signed Aug 2023, launched Nov 2023). The platform never exceeded ~5% market share, far below the 20% target. ESPN and Penn mutually terminated in November 2025 after just two years. Penn retained the 2.9M user database and rebranded to theScore Bet on Dec 1, 2025. ESPN immediately partnered with [[DraftKings]] for odds integration into broadcasts. Penn had previously failed with [[Barstool Sports]] (bought for $551M total, sold back to Dave Portnoy for $1).

## Business model

### How sportsbooks make money

```
Handle (total wagered) x Hold rate = Gross gaming revenue (GGR)
GGR - Promotional credits = Net gaming revenue (NGR)
NGR - State taxes - Licensing fees = Taxable income
```

The hold rate is the sportsbook's edge -- the percentage of wagered money retained as revenue. It varies by bet type:

| Bet type | Typical hold rate | Share of handle |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Straight bets (moneyline, spread, total) | 5-7% | ~45-50% |
| Parlays | 15-25% | ~35%+ (record Jan 2026) |
| Same-game parlays (SGP) | 20-30%+ | Growing fastest |
| Live/in-play | 8-12% | ~20-25% |
| Futures | 15-30% | ~5% |

The structural hold rate rising is the single most important profitability trend. FanDuel reported 14.5% structural hold in Q4 2024; DraftKings reported 10.5%. National blended hold rose from 8.1% (2022) to ~10%+ (2025), driven primarily by parlays. Same-game parlays are the most profitable product innovation in sports betting history -- they are highly correlated bets priced as if independent, generating enormous theoretical edge for operators.

### Revenue composition

| Revenue type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Sports betting GGR | Core sportsbook revenue |
| iGaming | Online casino (higher margin, ~30-40% of revenue for operators in iGaming states) |
| DFS | Daily fantasy sports (legacy, declining share) |
| B2B/media | Licensing, data rights, media integrations |

### Customer economics

| Metric | Typical range | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Customer acquisition cost (CPA) | $200-500 | Includes bonuses, promo bets, marketing |
| Customer lifetime value (LTV) | $500-1,500 | Varies by state, bet type, retention |
| LTV/CPA ratio | 1.2-3.0x | Flutter reports 1.2x one-year payback |
| Monthly active users | Varies | FanDuel: 4.3M+; DraftKings: 6M+; BetMGM: 979K |
| ARPU (annual) | $200-500 | Rising as acquisition spending moderates |

The industry spent ~$3B on marketing/advertising in 2024. The pivot from growth-at-all-costs to profitability is the defining shift of 2024-2025: operators are cutting promotional spending, raising minimum bet sizes (Illinois), and focusing on retention via loyalty programs rather than sign-up bonuses.

### Path to profitability

Sportsbooks typically take 2-3 years in a new state to reach profitability after heavy launch-year promotional spending. The industry-wide timeline:

| Phase | Period | Characteristics |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Land grab | 2018-2022 | Massive promo spend, negative EBITDA, market share prioritized |
| Rationalization | 2023-2024 | Promo cuts, first EBITDA-positive operators (Flutter 2023, DraftKings 2024) |
| Profitability | 2025+ | BetMGM turns profitable (FY2025), Caesars targeting $500M EBITDA |

## iGaming detail

### Legal states (Feb 2026)

| State | Launch | Key operators | 2024 revenue | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| New Jersey | 2013 | FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars | ~$2.4B | Most mature; iGaming > land-based for first time in 2025 |
| Delaware | 2012* | State-run | ~$30M | First state to legalize (2012); tiny market |
| Pennsylvania | 2019 | FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars | ~$2.0B | Second-largest market |
| Michigan | 2021 | FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM | ~$2.1B | Fast ramp; record $220.7M in Oct 2024 |
| West Virginia | 2020 | FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM | ~$200M | Small population |
| Connecticut | 2021 | FanDuel, DraftKings (tribal) | ~$400M | Tribal-operated |
| Rhode Island | 2024 | Bally's (sole operator) | ~$50M | Newest iGaming state |

*Delaware authorized online gambling in 2012 but has a small market.

### iGaming operator share

| Operator | iGaming GGR share | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| [[FanDuel]] | ~26% | #1 or #2 in most states |
| [[DraftKings]] | ~26% | Leading in Michigan |
| [[BetMGM]] | ~21% | Strongest iGaming positioning relative to sports |
| [[Caesars Digital]] | ~10% | Growing 51% YoY in Q2 2025 |

iGaming is strategically critical because it generates higher margins (no sports outcomes risk), offers 24/7 engagement, and cross-sells with sportsbook users. BetMGM's combined iGaming + sports betting revenue share (17%) narrows the gap with [[DraftKings]] (26%) and [[FanDuel]] (33%).

### States considering iGaming (2026)

| State | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| New York | Bills reintroduced 2026 session | Largest potential iGaming market |
| Illinois | Companion bills filed Jan 2026 | Gov. Pritzker supportive |
| Maine | Hearing held on tribal iGaming bill | Narrow scope |
| Virginia | Committee advancement | Incremental progress |
| Massachusetts | Multiple bills filed | Early stages |

New York legalizing iGaming would be transformative -- potentially $2B+ in annual revenue given the state's population and spending patterns.

---

## Tax rates by state

Tax rate on operator GGR is the single most important policy variable for operator economics. Wide variation reflects different state approaches to the revenue-generating potential of legalized betting.

### Tax rate tiers (online sports betting, 2025)

| Tier | Rate | States | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Ultra-high (51%) | 51% | New York, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island | NY generates $1B+/year despite (or because of) rate |
| High (30-50%) | 36-50% | Pennsylvania (36%), Delaware (50%) | PA allows promo deductions, effective rate ~25% |
| Graduated | 20-40% | Illinois (20-40% graduated + per-wager fee) | Most controversial; operators added surcharges |
| Moderate (15-25%) | 15-25% | New Jersey (19.75%), Maryland (20%), Ohio (20%), Louisiana (21.5%) | NJ and MD both raised rates in 2025 |
| Low (<15%) | 6.75-15% | Nevada (6.75%), Iowa (6.75%), Indiana (9.5%), Colorado (10%), Missouri (12%) | Operator-friendly |

### The trend: rising tax rates

Multiple states raised sports betting tax rates in 2025:

| State | Old rate | New rate | Effective |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Illinois | 15% flat | 20-40% graduated + $0.25-0.50/wager | Jul 2025 |
| New Jersey | 14.25% (online) | 19.75% (unified) | 2025 |
| Maryland | 15% | 20% | Mid-2025 |
| Louisiana | 15% | 21.5% | 2025 |
| Ohio | 10% | 20% | Jul 2023 (doubled) |

The Illinois per-wager fee is unprecedented: $0.25 on first 20M wagers, then $0.50 per wager. This prompted half the licensed operators to add customer surcharges, with the other half raising minimum bet amounts. Gov. Pritzker defended it by noting operators have not left New York despite its 51% rate.

### New York: the cautionary tale and success story

New York launched online sports betting in January 2022 with a 51% tax rate on GGR and no promotional deductions. This means the effective tax rate on NGR exceeds 51% for any operator that offers promotions.

Despite this, New York is the #1 handle state ($22.6B in 2024) and generates over $1B annually in tax revenue for education funding. The high rate pressures operator margins but has not deterred participation because the addressable market is simply too large to ignore.

### Federal tax changes (2026)

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (signed July 2025) introduced a new provision: bettors can only deduct 90% of gambling losses against winnings starting in 2026. A bettor who wins $10,000 and loses $10,000 would owe tax on $1,000 of "phantom income."

## Technology stack

### Operator technology

| Operator | Platform | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| FanDuel | [[OpenBet]] (Scientific Games) | Flutter's global platform; powers Betfair, Sky Bet, Paddy Power internationally |
| DraftKings | SBTech (acquired 2020) + proprietary | Migrated from Kambi; in-housed via SBTech acquisition; Simplebet for micro-betting |
| BetMGM | Proprietary + [[Entain]] technology | Angstrom Sports acquisition for AI-driven pricing |
| Fanatics | [[PointsBet]] infrastructure + custom | Acquired PointsBet US operations ($225M, 2024) |
| Caesars | Proprietary (rebuilt) | Previously used third-party; internal build-out |
| Penn/theScore | theScore technology | Built on theScore's Canadian-developed platform |

### Key B2B technology providers

| Provider | Role | Clients |
|----------|------|---------|
| [[Kambi]] | B2B sportsbook platform, odds, risk management | BetRivers, 40+ operators globally; previously powered DraftKings |
| [[OpenBet]] (Light & Wonder) | Betting engine, platform | Flutter/FanDuel, [[William Hill]] |
| Simplebet (now DraftKings) | Micro-betting, in-play pricing | Acquired by DraftKings; powers real-time micro-markets |
| Sportradar | Data feeds, integrity monitoring | Supplies most US sportsbooks |
| Genius Sports | Official data rights, streaming | Exclusive NFL data distribution |
| Angstrom Sports (now Entain) | AI odds modeling | Acquired by Entain for BetMGM |
| Sports IQ (now DraftKings) | AI-driven odds compilation | Acquired by DraftKings |

### AI in sports betting

AI adoption is accelerating across the industry:
- Kambi: 48% of bets on its network were "traded by AI" in 2025, up from 28% in 2024 and just 4% in 2022
- DraftKings: Simplebet and Sports IQ acquisitions power real-time micro-market pricing; 50%+ of Q1 2025 handle was live betting for the first time
- Sportradar: AI-powered odds suggestions and automated trading becoming standard
- Applications: odds compilation, risk management, customer personalization, fraud detection, responsible gambling intervention triggers

### The vertical integration trend

Major operators are acquiring or building proprietary technology to reduce B2B platform costs and gain competitive advantage. DraftKings' acquisition of SBTech (2020), Simplebet (2024), Sports IQ, and Railbird (2025) exemplifies this trend. FanDuel benefits from Flutter's global tech stack (OpenBet). The mid-tier operators increasingly rely on Kambi and other B2B providers.

---

## Key trends

### 1. Micro-betting and in-play wagering

Live/in-play betting crossed 50% of DraftKings' total handle in Q1 2025 for the first time. Micro-betting (wagering on individual plays -- next pitch, next possession, next serve) is the fastest-growing segment, particularly among younger bettors who favor immediate outcomes. AI-driven pricing enables sportsbooks to offer hundreds of micro-markets per game without manual trader oversight.

### 2. Prediction markets as competitive threat

The emergence of federally regulated [[Prediction markets]] ([[Kalshi]], [[Polymarket]], plus sportsbook-owned platforms like DraftKings Predictions, FanDuel Predicts, and Fanatics Markets) represents the most disruptive threat to the regulated sports betting industry. Prediction market trading volume surged from $9B (2024) to $44B+ (2025).

Key concern: if [[Kalshi]] offers customizable parlays at better odds (peer-to-peer pricing vs. sportsbook margin), it could force operators to reduce hold rates. DraftKings and Flutter stocks each fell 10%+ when Kalshi announced parlay offerings. Nine states have issued cease-and-desist letters; the federal vs. state jurisdictional question likely headed to the Supreme Court.

Sportsbook response: DraftKings acquired Railbird Technologies ($250M, Oct 2025) and launched DraftKings Predictions in 38 states. FanDuel launched FanDuel Predicts (Dec 2025). Fanatics launched Fanatics Markets (Dec 2025). Strategy: if prediction markets are the future, own one.

### 3. Parlay dominance

Parlays represented 35.1% of total handle as of January 2026, a record and up from ~25% in 2022. Same-game parlays (SGPs) are the key driver -- they carry 20-30%+ hold rates vs. 5-7% for straight bets. This structural shift is the primary reason industry hold rates are rising and profitability is improving.

### 4. Consolidation and M&A

The industry is consolidating around a small number of scaled operators. Notable deals:

| Deal | Date | Value | Significance |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| DraftKings acquires Simplebet | Aug 2024 | ~$170M | In-play micro-betting technology |
| DraftKings acquires Jackpocket | 2024 | $750M | Digital lottery cross-sell |
| DraftKings acquires Railbird | Oct 2025 | $250M | Prediction markets entry |
| Fanatics acquires PointsBet US | Apr 2024 | $225M | Sportsbook foundation |
| Entain acquires Angstrom Sports | 2024 | ~$200M | AI-driven odds for BetMGM |
| Penn terminates ESPN Bet | Nov 2025 | ($150M/yr savings) | Failed media brand partnership |

### 5. Rising state taxes

As documented in the tax section, multiple states raised tax rates in 2025. Illinois' per-wager fee is the most aggressive innovation. The trend reflects states viewing established sports betting markets as reliable revenue sources. Risk: if taxes rise too high, operators may reduce investment or exit marginal states.

### 6. Responsible gambling regulation tightening

Public sentiment has shifted: 43% of US adults said legal sports betting is bad for society in 2025, up from 34% in 2022. Key developments:
- Prop bet restrictions: Following the Cleveland Guardians pitch-fixing scandal (pitchers [[Emmanuel Clase]] and [[Luis Ortiz]] indicted), MLB capped pitch-level props at $200. The NFL circulated a memo seeking to limit props on injuries, officiating, and pre-determined outcomes. At least 17 states restrict college player props.
- SAFE Bet Act: Federal legislation proposed by Rep. Tonko and Sen. Blumenthal to establish national advertising standards, ban prop bets, and restrict AI targeting of bettors.
- Algorithmic intervention: Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and North Carolina require operators to use data-driven triggers for problem gambling intervention.
- Self-exclusion: All 38 jurisdictions require self-exclusion programs.

### 7. Media integration

Sports media companies are increasingly intertwined with betting:
- ESPN partnered with [[DraftKings]] for odds integration (Dec 2025, after ESPN Bet failure)
- [[FanDuel]] TV (rebranded from TVG) provides dedicated sports betting content
- Amazon, Fox, and NBC all integrate betting elements into broadcasts
- League data rights are monetized through exclusive distribution deals (Genius Sports' NFL deal)

---

## Regulatory framework

### State-level regulation

Sports betting is regulated state-by-state. Each state sets its own:
- Tax rates on operator GGR
- Licensing requirements and fees
- Eligible bet types (some ban college props, in-state teams, etc.)
- Operator limits (some states allow unlimited licenses, NY has 9 online operators)
- Online vs. retail requirements
- Promotional deduction rules

### Key regulatory bodies

| Body | Role |
|------|------|
| State gaming commissions | Primary regulators (e.g., NY State Gaming Commission, NJ DGE) |
| American Gaming Association (AGA) | Industry trade group; lobbying, research |
| [[CFTC]] | Regulates prediction markets (event contracts) -- overlapping jurisdiction with sports betting |
| Federal Trade Commission (FTC) | Advertising standards |
| National Council on Problem Gambling | Advocacy, helpline (1-800-522-4700) |

### Wire Act and federal framework

The Wire Act (1961) prohibits interstate sports wagering via wire communications. The DOJ's 2018 opinion expanded interpretation to apply beyond sports betting, but a 2019 First Circuit ruling limited it to sports wagering. States operate individual markets -- a bet placed in New Jersey must be processed within New Jersey borders, even if the bettor is physically in the state using mobile.

There is no comprehensive federal sports betting regulation. The tribal gaming framework ([[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], IGRA) adds complexity in states with tribal compacts (Florida, Connecticut, Wisconsin, many Western states).
