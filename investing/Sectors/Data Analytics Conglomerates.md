# Data Analytics Conglomerates

Companies that own proprietary data corpora accumulated over decades and sell analytics, workflow tools, and decision-making products on top. High margins, recurring revenue, deep moats. The original "data is the new oil" businesses — long before AI made that literal.

## The sector

| Company | Ticker | Focus | Key brands |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| [[RELX]] | REL / RELX | Legal, scientific, risk, exhibitions | LexisNexis, [[Elsevier]], RX |
| [[Thomson Reuters]] | TRI | Legal, tax, news, corporates | Westlaw, Reuters |
| [[Wolters Kluwer]] | WKL | Legal, tax, health, compliance | CCH, UpToDate, Kluwer |
| [[S&P Global]] | SPGI | Ratings, indices, market data | S&P Ratings, Platts, IHS Markit |
| [[Moody's]] | MCO | Ratings, analytics, risk | Moody's Analytics |
| [[MSCI]] | MSCI | Indices, ESG data, portfolio analytics | MSCI World, ESG Ratings |
| [[Verisk]] | VRSK | Insurance analytics, risk modeling | ISO, AIR Worldwide |
| [[Bloomberg]] | Private | Financial data, terminals, news | Bloomberg Terminal |
| [[FactSet]] | FDS | Financial data, analytics | FactSet Terminal |

## Common characteristics

- Proprietary data sets built over decades (RELX: 119B documents, Bloomberg: 300K+ terminal subscribers)
- 80-95% recurring/electronic revenue
- High operating margins (30-45%)
- Switching costs: deeply embedded in customer workflows
- Network effects: more data → better analytics → more customers → more data
- Pricing power: essential tools, low churn

## AI as tailwind vs threat

The central question for this sector: does AI strengthen or erode the data moat?

**AI as tailwind (bull case):**
- These companies own the training data and retrieval corpora AI models need
- Can embed AI into existing products → charge more, expand margins
- RELX operating margin: 33.9% → 34.8% as AI improves cost leverage
- Customers want AI-enhanced analytics from trusted sources with audit trails
- CEO Engstrom (RELX, Feb 2026): AI "enabling us to add more value"

**AI as threat (bear case):**
- Horizontal AI platforms ([[Anthropic]], [[OpenAI]]) could bypass proprietary data with web-scale training
- AI startups ([[Harvey]], [[Legora]]) iterate faster on UX and workflow
- Open access movements threaten academic publishing (Elsevier)
- Clients could build their own tools with Claude/GPT instead of paying for packaged analytics
- LLMs getting better at synthesizing publicly available information

**The paradox:** AI startups often build on top of these companies' data. [[Harvey]] integrates with LexisNexis. Financial AI tools pull from Bloomberg/FactSet. The data owners are simultaneously the incumbents being disrupted and the infrastructure layer the disruptors depend on.

See [[Horizontal vs vertical AI]] for the deeper framework.

## Valuation context

These trade at premium multiples reflecting data moat durability:

| Company | P/E (approx) | Operating margin |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| MSCI | ~45x | ~55% |
| S&P Global | ~35x | ~45% |
| Moody's | ~35x | ~40% |
| RELX | ~30x | ~35% |
| Verisk | ~35x | ~40% |
| Thomson Reuters | ~30x | ~30% |
| Wolters Kluwer | ~28x | ~25% |

Premium is justified by recurring revenue, pricing power, and difficulty of replicating decades of structured data. Risk is that AI narrows the gap faster than expected.
