## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.49** | Moderate (valid sector) |
| Range | 0.37 - 0.59 | LMT-RTX to GD-LHX |
| vs SPY | **0.11-0.34** | Very market-uncorrelated |
| vs ITA | 0.24-0.43 | Weak (ITA is BA-heavy) |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| GD - LHX | **0.59** |
| LMT - LHX | 0.54 |
| RTX - NOC | 0.53 |
| RTX - GD | 0.53 |
| NOC - LHX | 0.51 |
| LMT - NOC | 0.47 |
| LMT - GD | 0.47 |
| RTX - LHX | 0.47 |
| NOC - GD | 0.43 |
| LMT - RTX | 0.37 |

**No good ETF benchmark.** ITA (0.24-0.43) is Boeing-heavy and tracks SPY at 0.65.

## Key actors

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | Focus |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| [[Lockheed Martin]] | LMT | ~$140B | F-35, missiles, space |
| [[RTX]] | RTX | ~$160B | Missiles, engines, avionics |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | NOC | ~$80B | B-21, space, cyber |
| [[General Dynamics]] | GD | ~$85B | Submarines, Gulfstream, IT |
| [[L3Harris]] | LHX | ~$45B | Communications, ISR |

## Why Boeing is excluded

| Stock | Correlation with Primes | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-------|
| BA | **0.12-0.33** | Commercial aerospace story |

Boeing trades on 737 MAX production, 787 ramp, and commercial aviation — not defense budgets. Including BA weakens sector correlation from 0.49 to 0.40.

## Capital returns

![[defense-buybacks-dividends-since-2020.png]]
*Primes return cash aggressively — Lockheed leads at ~$37B total. Boeing's minimal returns reflect its commercial aerospace struggles and balance sheet repair.*

---

## Why market-uncorrelated

Defense primes trade on:
- Defense budget (DoD, NATO allies)
- Program milestones (F-35, B-21)
- Backlog visibility
- Geopolitical events

NOT on:
- GDP growth
- Consumer spending
- Tech earnings

This makes defense a natural hedge against growth/tech exposure.

## vs Defense IT Services

| Sector | Correlation | Business Model |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Defense Primes | 0.49 | Hardware, platforms |
| [[Defense IT Services]] | 0.61 | Services, labor |

Different risk profiles — primes have program risk, IT services have recompete risk.
