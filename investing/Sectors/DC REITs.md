| Revenue model | Long-term leases | GPU hosting, volatile |
| Customer | Enterprise, hyperscaler | AI startups, crypto |
| Margins | 60-70% gross | Lower, more variable |
| Capital | REIT structure, stable | Equity/debt dependent |
| Risk profile | Predictable | High beta, speculative |

## Why separate from Crypto-to-AI

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Correlation** | EQIX-CORZ: 0.10, EQIX-HUT: 0.15 |
| **Business model** | Lease vs operate GPUs |
| **Customer base** | Enterprise/cloud vs AI/crypto |
| **Investor base** | REIT funds vs growth/spec |

The 0.08-0.20 cross-correlation proves these are fundamentally different businesses despite both owning data centers.
