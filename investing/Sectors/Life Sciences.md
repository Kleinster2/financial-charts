## Key themes (2025-2026)

### AI in drug discovery

| Company | Partners | Deal value |
|---------|----------|------------|
| [[Insilico Medicine]] | Sanofi | $1.2B |
| [[Isomorphic Labs]] | Novartis + Lilly | ~$3B |
| [[Recursion]] | Merged with Exscientia | Combined platform |

**Thesis:** AI compresses R&D timelines, reduces failure rates. Winners = those with proprietary data + wet lab validation.

### Liquid biopsy / Early detection

| Company | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [[Guardant Health]] | Cancer screening, therapy selection |
| [[Exact Sciences]] | Cologuard (colon), multi-cancer |
| [[Natera]] | Prenatal, oncology, organ transplant |
| [[Tempus]] | AI-driven precision medicine |

**Thesis:** Shift from late-stage treatment to early detection. TAM expansion as tests get cheaper and more accurate.

### Fertility tech

| Company | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| [[Conceivable Life Sciences]] | Robotic IVF labs (AURA) |

**Thesis:** Declining birth rates + later parenthood = growing demand. Automation = lower cost + higher access.
