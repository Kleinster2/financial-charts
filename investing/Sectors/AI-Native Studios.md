# AI-Native Studios

Studios that produce film, TV, and animation content primarily through AI workflows — not traditional studios using AI as a tool, but companies built around AI-first production pipelines.

At least **65 AI-centric film studios** launched globally since 2022 (per FBRC research), 30+ in 2024–early 2025.

## Deep dives

### Fable Studios

Founded 2018 by **Edward Saatchi** (son of Saatchi & Saatchi family, ex-Oculus Story Studios). Emmy-winning VR pedigree (*Wolves in the Walls*, 2019 Primetime Emmy for Interactive Media). Calls itself the "Netflix of AI."

**Showrunner** — streaming platform generating entire animated TV episodes from text prompts. Launched publicly July 2025. Powered by proprietary SHOW-2 model. 100,000+ waitlist. Content generates in real-time (same duration as the clip). Free viewing; $10–$20/mo creator subscription planned.

| Milestone | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| SHOW-1 paper | 9 AI *South Park* episodes → 80M+ views (unauthorized) |
| Sim Francisco | First fully simulated AI city, setting for *Exit Valley* |
| Amazon investment | July 2025, Alexa Fund (amount undisclosed) |
| First movie | *Everything Is Fine* — targeted 2026, fully playable |
| Orson Welles project | AI reconstruction of lost 43 min of *The Magnificent Ambersons* — New Yorker feature (Feb 2026) |

**Business model:** Creator subs + free viewing + IP licensing deals with studios (one unnamed deal done, Disney talks reported).

### Promise

**MUSE** — proprietary production workflow integrating generative AI throughout the creative process. Partnership with [[Google]] DeepMind for technology.

Acquired **Curious Refuge** (top GenAI film school). First feature in production. ~10 employees, expanding.

### Moonvalley

Founded by **Naeem Talukdar** (ex-Zapier), former [[Google]] DeepMind scientists Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski.

Talent from DeepMind, Google, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, Disney, DreamWorks.

### Toonstar

Founded 2017 by **John Attanasio** and **Luisa Huang** (ex-Warner Bros). Claims 80% faster and 90% cheaper production than traditional animation.

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Flagship | *StEvEn & Parker* — 8.6M YouTube subs, 30M views/week |
| Engine | **Ink & Pixel** (proprietary AI production) |
| Distribution | **SPOT** (AI-powered, real-time audience insights) |
| Representation | Signed with WME (June 2025) — one of first AI studios with major agency |
| Team | ~20 people |

### Invisible Universe

Internet-first animation studio. $20M Series A led by Seven Seven Six ([[Alexis Ohanian]]). 7 animated franchises, 13M followers, billions of views. Celebrity backers: Serena Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Will Smith.

Launched **Invisible Studio** (May 2025) — AI engine for short-form video. CEO Tricia Biggio.

### Utopai Studios

Rebranded from Cybever (August 2025). Claims to be Hollywood's first AI-driven film/TV studio. First project: *Cortes*, written by Academy Award-nominated Nicholas Kazan — a script considered "unfilmable" for decades. Partnership with K5 International (global sales) and OPSIS (previs, ex-GoT/Captain America).

## The economics argument

AI-native studios claim to solve the "barbell problem" — where only blockbusters ($200M+) and micro-budget content could get greenlit. AI workflows theoretically make mid-budget content viable again:

| Traditional | AI-native (claimed) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| $10M budget → $10M production value | $10M budget → $30M production value |
| 6–18 month production | Weeks to months |
| 200+ person crew | 10–20 person team |

These claims are early and unproven at scale.

---

## IP licensing — the business model frontier

The critical unlock for AI studios is **sanctioned use of existing IP**:

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Studio IP deals | [[Fable Studios]] revenue-sharing with unnamed studio |
| Licensed training only | [[Moonvalley]] — no scraped data |
| Platform partnerships | [[Disney]]–[[OpenAI]] Sora deal |
| Original IP | [[Toonstar]] owns *StEvEn & Parker* |

Studios are moving from blocking AI to monetizing IP through it.

---

## Hollywood response

Every major studio now has an AI research division:

| Studio | AI effort |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Warner Bros Discovery]] | AI Production Lab |
| [[Disney]] | AI Innovation Group, $1B OpenAI investment |
| Universal | Undisclosed |
| Paramount | Undisclosed |
| [[Sony]] | Undisclosed |

Public discussion limited due to WGA/SAG-AFTRA sensitivities post-2023 strikes. The 2023 strike contracts set guardrails but didn't ban AI — creating a gap these studios operate in.

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| AI-native content | [[Fable Studios]], [[Promise]], [[Toonstar]] (all private) |
| Licensed AI models | [[Moonvalley]] (private) |
| Social-first animation | [[Invisible Universe]] (private) |
| IP monetization | [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros Discovery]] |
| Compute demand | [[NVIDIA]], [[CoreWeave]] |

**All pure-play AI studios are private.** Public exposure through media companies adopting AI (Disney, WBD) or compute suppliers.

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Quality ceiling** | AI content may plateau below audience expectations |
| **Union resistance** | WGA/SAG-AFTRA could tighten AI rules in 2026 negotiations |
| **IP litigation** | Unauthorized training material (Fable's South Park episode) |
| **Audience acceptance** | "AI-made" label may carry stigma |
| **Funding dependency** | Most studios pre-revenue, burning VC cash |
| **Big tech competition** | Google, OpenAI could vertically integrate into content |

---

## Timeline to watch

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026 | Fable first movie (*Everything Is Fine*) |
| 2026 | Promise first feature film |
| 2026 | WGA/SAG-AFTRA contract renegotiations — AI terms |
| 2026–2027 | First AI-native content hitting mainstream streaming? |
