# Drug Distribution

The pharmaceutical supply chain: wholesalers who move drugs from manufacturers to pharmacies, and PBMs who manage drug benefits for insurers. Both are oligopolies facing unprecedented regulatory scrutiny.

## Market structure

### The Big Three Distributors

| Company | Ticker | FY Revenue | Market Share | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| [[McKesson]] | MCK | $359B | ~33% | \#1, specialty/oncology focus |
| [[Cencora]] | COR | $294B | ~33% | \#2, formerly AmerisourceBergen |
| [[Cardinal Health]] | CAH | $223B | ~25% | \#3, recovering from OptumRx loss |

**Combined:** >90% of US pharmaceutical distribution. ~$900B in annual revenue.

### The Big Three PBMs

| PBM | Parent | Market Share |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| OptumRx | [[UnitedHealth]] | ~25% |
| CVS Caremark | [[CVS Health]] | ~25% |
| Express Scripts | [[Cigna]] | ~25% |

**Combined:** ~80% of US prescription drug market.

## Why this sector matters

**Oligopoly economics.** Both distributors and PBMs operate as tight oligopolies. The Big Three distributors have >90% market share; Big Three PBMs have ~80%. This concentration creates:
- Pricing power despite thin margins
- Barriers to entry (scale, relationships, logistics)
- Regulatory and political risk

**Vertical integration.** The major insurers have integrated PBMs:
- [[UnitedHealth]] → Optum (OptumRx + care delivery)
- [[CVS Health]] → Aetna + CVS Caremark + retail pharmacies
- [[Cigna]] → Express Scripts

This integration is now under antitrust attack.

## Business model

### Distributors

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Gross margin | ~3% |
| Operating margin | ~1.5% |
| Inventory turns | ~12x |

Ultra-thin margins on massive volumes. Cash flow driven by favorable payment terms — distributors get paid by pharmacies faster than they pay manufacturers.

**Growth levers:**
- Specialty/oncology drugs (higher margins)
- Manufacturer services
- Automation investments

### PBMs

| Revenue Source | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Spread pricing** | Buy drugs at one price, charge plans higher price |
| **Rebates** | Negotiate discounts from manufacturers, keep portion |
| **Admin fees** | Per-claim processing fees |
| **Specialty pharmacy** | Dispense high-cost drugs through owned pharmacies |

Opacity is the business model. PBMs argue they lower costs; critics say they extract rents through hidden fees.

## Current themes (2025-2026)

### PBM reform wave

| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| **Spread pricing ban** | Effective Jan 1, 2026 |
| **2026 Appropriations Act** | Passed Jan 22, 2026 — CMS to define "reasonable" contract terms |
| **State reforms** | Alabama, Iowa banning spread pricing, patient steering |
| **Lawsuits** | CVS/Cigna challenging Arkansas pharmacy ownership ban |

**Employer defection:** 61% of employers contracted with Big Three PBMs in 2025, down from 72% in 2024.

### [[Claritev]] antitrust precedent

The [[AMA]] lawsuit against [[Claritev]] (algorithmic reimbursement) could reshape how healthcare intermediaries operate. DOJ filed statement of interest supporting plaintiffs in March 2025. If Claritev loses, PBMs face similar "hub-and-spoke" conspiracy theories.

### Post-Thompson scrutiny

The assassination of [[UnitedHealth]]'s Brian Thompson (Dec 2024) intensified political pressure on healthcare middlemen. Prior authorization, claim denials, and PBM opacity are now political liabilities.

### Vertical integration under attack

Congressional hearings examining whether insurer-PBM integration harms competition:
- Self-dealing allegations (steering to owned pharmacies)
- Rebate retention vs pass-through
- Specialty pharmacy conflicts

[[Cigna]] positioned as relative winner — sold Medicare business, less vertically integrated than [[UnitedHealth]] or [[CVS Health]].

## Distributor dynamics

### Specialty pivot

All three distributors are pivoting toward specialty drugs (biologics, oncology) where margins are higher:

| Company | Specialty Focus |
|---------|-----------------|
| [[McKesson]] | Oncology, PRISM Vision acquisition |
| [[Cencora]] | Retina Consultants ($4.4B), specialty pharma |
| [[Cardinal Health]] | BioPharma Solutions (+30% growth FY26) |

### Customer concentration risk

[[Cardinal Health]] lost its OptumRx contract to [[McKesson]] — caused FY25 revenue to decline 2%. Demonstrates risk of customer concentration in oligopoly market.

### Medicare drug pricing

2026 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program required distributors to transition manufacturer agreements. All three completed successfully before January 2026.

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Oligopoly position provides stability
- Specialty/oncology growth improving margins
- PBM reform may actually benefit transparent players
- Attractive free cash flow generation

**Bear case:**
- PBM reform could compress margins
- Vertical integration pressure from insurers
- Amazon pharmacy threat (limited so far)
- Political/regulatory uncertainty

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **PBM antitrust outcomes** | Structural margin compression |
| **Spread pricing bans** | Revenue model disruption |
| **Vertical integration breakup** | Forced divestitures |
| **Customer concentration** | Contract losses (see Cardinal/OptumRx) |
| **Amazon entry** | Disintermediation (low probability near-term) |
