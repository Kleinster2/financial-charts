## European launch renaissance (2025-2026)

Europe completed just **7 orbital launches in 2025** vs US 130+. After retiring Ariane 5 (2023) and grounding Vega-C (2 years), Europe temporarily lost independent access to orbit — ESA had to ask SpaceX to launch Galileo satellites.

**Recovery:**
- **Ariane 6** flew 2024 (cost €4.7B, not reusable). Targeting 10 launches/yr by 2027. First Amazon Kuiper launch early 2026.
- **Vega-C** (Avio) overcame technical issues, resumed flights.

**Startup challengers (ESA European Launcher Challenge, €900M):**

| Company | Country | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [[Isar Aerospace]] | Germany | First launch attempted 2025 (failed ~30s), retry 2026 |
| Rocket Factory Augsburg | Germany | Pre-orbital |
| PLD Space | Spain | Pre-orbital |
| MaiaSpace | France | ArianeGroup subsidiary |
| Orbex | UK | Pre-orbital |

**Funding:** ESA approved record **€22B** over 3 years (Nov 2025). Germany plans **€35B** in space-defense by 2030.

**Structural headwinds:** Geo-return policy allocates contracts by country funding share (not capability). Europe space investment still far behind US. Competition may fragment limited funding.

**Comparison:** Rocket Lab (RKLB, $45B mkt cap) took ~75 successful small-launcher missions since 2018 to reach medium-lift (Neutron). SpaceX valued at ~$800B.
