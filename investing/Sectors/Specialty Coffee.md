# Specialty Coffee

Hub for the global specialty coffee industry — roasters, cafes, supply chain, and the consolidation wave reshaping the sector.

## Market Overview

Global specialty coffee market estimated at $100-110B (2025), growing ~10% CAGR. US specialty market alone ~$48B. Specialty now exceeds traditional coffee in daily US consumption (2024-25 was second consecutive year). Away-from-home channels account for 73% of specialty revenue. 25-39 age cohort is the core growth driver.

The broader global coffee market is ~$145B (2025), with specialty representing a disproportionate share of value despite <10% of volume. The market is moderately concentrated — [[Nestle]], [[JDE Peet's]], [[Starbucks]], [[Keurig Dr Pepper]], [[Lavazza]], and Tata Coffee are the top players.

## Commodity Backdrop

Arabica hit record highs above $4/lb in early 2025 (tripled since 2022), driven by drought in Brazil's Minas Gerais region and erratic rainfall in Vietnam. Robusta also hit records. Coffee has extremely low price elasticity — a 1% price increase historically yields only 0.25% demand decline (UBS).

Prices eased to ~$3.20/lb by early Feb 2026 as Brazil's 2026 crop forecast came in strong: CONAB projects 66.2M bags (+17.2% YoY), a record. Arabica prices projected to fall ~13% in 2026. Key risks: weather shocks in Brazil, US tariffs on Brazilian coffee, biennial crop cycle.

| 2025 | JDE Peet's | [[Keurig Dr Pepper]] | EUR15.7B ($18.4B) |

JAB's $50B coffee buying spree is widely seen as having underperformed — the holding company is now pivoting to insurance and pet care while unwinding coffee exposure via the KDP-JDE deal.

## Supply Chain

Coffee passes through: farmer → local buyer/cooperative → exporter → importer → roaster → retailer/cafe. Each step erodes transparency and farmer economics.

[[Third Wave coffee]] companies disrupted this via direct trade — roasters buy directly from farmers, paying premiums of ~30% over commodity prices. ~75% of [[Irving Farm Coffee]]'s beans are direct-traded. [[Illycaffè]] pioneered direct farmer relationships in Italy. Specialty beans represent ~50% of global coffee value despite far less volume.

Key tension: direct trade benefits farmers but lacks formal certification (unlike Fair Trade). Fair Trade premiums often don't reach farmers — studies show farmers receive ~1/6 of the consumer premium. Direct trade's accountability depends entirely on the roaster's integrity.

## Investment Angles

Headwinds:
- Commodity price volatility squeezes roaster margins (green bean costs tripled 2022-2025)
- NYC/SF cafe economics brutal — high rents, labor costs, thin margins drove [[Irving Farm Coffee]] to close 2 locations in 2024-25
- Consolidation by [[Nestle]]/[[JAB Holding]]/[[Keurig Dr Pepper]] makes it hard for independents to compete on distribution

Tailwinds:
- Specialty coffee consumption growing faster than traditional (~10% CAGR vs. ~5% overall)
- Asia-Pacific growth (12% CAGR) as young urban consumers adopt coffee culture
- RTD/cold brew segment growing rapidly, higher margin than cafe-only
- Climate disruption to supply benefits established direct-trade relationships (locked-in sourcing)
- Premium pricing power — specialty consumers are price-insensitive relative to commodity coffee drinkers
