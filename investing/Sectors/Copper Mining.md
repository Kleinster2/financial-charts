**Copper Mining** — The industry that extracts and refines copper. Structural supply deficit emerging as demand accelerates from data centers, EVs, grid, and defense. See [[Copper]] for the commodity itself.

## S&P Global outlook (Jan 2026)

**"Copper in the Age of AI"** — study co-chaired by Daniel Yergin (Vice Chairman, S&P Global).

> "Copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper... Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defense are scaling all at once—and supply is not on track to keep pace. **At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.**" — **Daniel Yergin**

The deficit constitutes a **"systemic risk for global industries, technological advancement and economic growth."**

> "Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems." — **Carlos Pascual**, co-chair

### Supply vs demand to 2040

| Metric | 2025 | 2030 | 2040 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Demand | 28M tonnes | — | 42M tonnes |
| Primary production | — | 33M (peak) | 22M tonnes |
| Recycled copper | 4M tonnes | — | 10M tonnes |
| **Gap** | Balanced | Emerging | **10M tonnes** |

### 2040 demand by sector

| Sector | Demand | Share | Gap |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| Core economic | 23M tonnes | 53% | — |
| Energy transition | 15.7M tonnes | 37% | — |
| **Subtotal** | 38.7M tonnes | — | **7M** |
| AI/data centers + defense | ~4M tonnes | 10% | +3M |
| Humanoid robots (1B-10B) | 1.6M+ tonnes | — | Upside |

Global electricity demand up ~50% by 2040.

### Infrastructure pipeline

- **100+ new data center projects** launched (~$61B)
- 550 GW data center capacity by 2040 (5x 2022)
- 330 Hoover Dams or 650 nuclear reactors equivalent annually

### Supply constraints

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Mine timeline | **17 years** discovery to production |
| Production peak | 2030, then decline (ore grades) |
| Concentration | 6 countries = 67% of mining |
| China control | 40% smelting, 66% concentrate imports |
| US status | Designated "critical metal" in 2025 |

> "Bridging the impending supply gap depends not only on geology, engineering, and logistics and investment, but also on governance and policies... The alternative is uncertainty, and uncertainty comes at a hefty cost." — **Eleonor Kramarz**, S&P Global

### Market mechanism caveat

S&P notes deficits remain "hypothetical" — prices ration demand and incentivize supply. But projected gap scale suggests prices must rise substantially.

> "The future is not just copper-intensive, it is copper-enabled. Every new building, every line of digital code, every renewable megawatt, every new car, every advanced weapon system depends on the metal." — **Aurian De La Noue**, S&P Global

## Defense / Munitions

Copper is the **second-highest material by weight** in US defense production.

| Application | Copper use |
|-------------|------------|
| 155mm artillery shell | 0.5 kg each |
| Driving bands | Shell rotation/rifling |
| Shaped-charge liners | Anti-tank munitions |
| Bullet jackets | Small arms rounds |
| Missile guidance | Electronics, wiring |

### Rearmament demand

| Region | Pre-war | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| US | 93K shells/yr | 1.2M shells/yr | 2025 |
| EU | 230K shells/yr | 3M shells/yr | End of decade |
| Ukraine consumption | — | 7,000 shells/day | Current |

US investing **$5B** in munitions factory upgrades.

## Major producers

### Public companies

| Company | Ticker | Production | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| [[Freeport-McMoRan]] | FCX | ~2M tonnes | Largest public, Grasberg |
| [[Southern Copper]] | SCCO | ~1M tonnes | Lowest cost, 60yr reserves |
| [[BHP]] | BHP | ~1.7M tonnes | Diversified major |
| [[Rio Tinto]] | RIO | ~0.6M tonnes | Growing copper focus |
| [[Antofagasta]] | ANTO.L | ~0.7M tonnes | Pure-play Chile |
| Teck Resources | TECK | ~0.3M tonnes | Copper growth story |
| First Quantum | FM.TO | ~0.4M tonnes | Cobre Panama disruption |

### State-owned

| Company | Country | Production | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| [[Codelco]] | [[Chile]] | ~1.6M tonnes | World's largest |

---

## Geographic concentration

| Country | Share of production | Key assets |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| [[Chile]] | ~25% | Escondida, Codelco mines |
| Peru | ~10% | Cerro Verde, Antamina |
| China | ~8% | Mostly smelting |
| DRC | ~8% | Kamoa-Kakula |
| USA | ~6% | Morenci, Bingham Canyon |
| Indonesia | ~5% | Grasberg |

## Investment considerations

### Bull case

- Structural deficit widening (S&P: 10M tonnes by 2040)
- AI infrastructure = multi-year demand
- Supply cannot respond quickly (17-year timeline)
- Electrification adds baseload demand
- Price must rise to incentivize new supply

### Bear case

- 1990s fiber optic parallel — capacity overbuilds
- Substitution at high prices (aluminum)
- China slowdown (still ~50% of demand)
- Recession dampens industrial demand
- Speculative excess in "AI metals" theme

---

## Recycling

| Metric | 2025 | 2040 |
|--------|------|------|
| Recycled supply | 4M tonnes | 10M tonnes |
| Share of demand | ~14% | ~24% |

Recycling doubles but still leaves 10M tonne gap.
