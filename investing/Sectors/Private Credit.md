## Active crisis: [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]]

**Status: Unfolding** (Feb 2026 →)

The retail model is breaking. After 5 years of selling illiquid loans as "bond alternatives with quarterly liquidity," the industry faces accelerating redemptions.

| Fund | AUM | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| OBDC II ([[Blue Owl]]) | $1.7B | 🔴 **Gated** (Feb 19) |
| OBDC ([[Blue Owl]]) | $16B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| ARCC ([[Ares Management]]) | $26B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| BCRED ([[Blackstone]]) | $50B+ | 🟡 Watching |

**Next test:** March 31 quarter-end — redemption requests hit all semi-liquid funds simultaneously.

**Key event notes:**
- [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] — master event
- [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] — first instance

## Structural risks

| Risk | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Retail liquidity mismatch** | 🔴 Active | Illiquid loans in "quarterly liquid" wrappers. OBDC II broke first |
| **Software concentration** | 🟡 Elevated | 14-16% of spec-grade. AI disruption compressing valuations |
| **Covenant erosion** | 🟡 Trending | Cov-lite creeping into middle market. Recovery rates will suffer |
| **Opacity** | 🟡 Structural | Quarterly marks lag reality. Losses hidden until forced recognition |
| **Interconnection** | 🟡 Structural | Multiple lenders hold same borrowers. One forced sale → contagion |
| **Regulatory** | 🟡 Emerging | Warren calling for capital requirements + stress tests |

## Key theses

| Thesis | Note | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Software as concentration risk | [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] | Active — OBDC II gate validated |
| Retail liquidity mismatch | [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] | Active — first gate occurred |
| Covenant erosion storing losses | [[Private credit]] | Slow burn — untested in recession |
| AI infrastructure financing | [[AI infrastructure financing]] | Bull case — Blue Owl Meta $30B |

---

## Sector dynamics

**Bull case:**
- $1.8T → $3.5T growth trajectory
- Banks retreating from risky lending → private credit fills gap
- Hyperscaler AI infrastructure needs off-balance-sheet financing
- Floating rates = yields adjust with Fed
- Strong management fee streams (1-2% of AUM)

**Bear case:**
- Retail liquidity crisis unfolding — first gate occurred Feb 2026
- Software concentration at all-time levels as AI disrupts borrowers
- Covenant-lite erosion removes early warning tools
- Opacity masks real losses until too late
- Regulatory crackdown could constrain fundraising
- Banks re-entering the market (JPMorgan, Goldman, SocGen)
