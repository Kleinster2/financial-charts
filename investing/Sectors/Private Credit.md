## Active crisis: [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]]

**Status: Unfolding** (Feb 2026 →)

The retail model is breaking. After 5 years of selling illiquid loans as "bond alternatives with quarterly liquidity," the industry faces accelerating redemptions.

| Fund | AUM | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| OBDC II ([[Blue Owl]]) | $1.7B | 🔴 **Gated** (Feb 19) |
| OBDC ([[Blue Owl]]) | $16B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| ARCC ([[Ares Management]]) | $26B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| BCRED ([[Blackstone]]) | $50B+ | 🟡 Watching |

**Next test:** March 31 quarter-end — redemption requests hit all semi-liquid funds simultaneously.

**Key event notes:**
- [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] — master event
- [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] — first instance

## Structural risks

| Risk | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Retail liquidity mismatch** | 🔴 Active | Illiquid loans in "quarterly liquid" wrappers. OBDC II broke first |
| **Software concentration** | 🟡 Elevated | 14-16% of spec-grade. AI disruption compressing valuations |
| **Covenant erosion / LMEs** | 🟡 Trending | 33 creditor-harming restructurings in 2024, 23 in 2025 ($500M+ debt each). Cov-lite creeping into middle market |
| **Opacity / valuation lag** | 🟡 Structural | [[BlackRock]] marked [[Renovo Home Partners]] at 100 cents; bankrupt one month later, total loss on $150M |
| **Bank interconnection** | 🟡 Growing | US bank exposure to private debt vehicles: **$300B** (Moody's, Oct 2025) |
| **Insurer interconnection** | 🟡 Growing | US life insurer exposure to illiquid credit: **$2T** (Moody's). [[PE-insurance convergence]] deepening |
| **Ratings shopping** | 🟡 Emerging | SEC probing [[Egan-Jones]] — rated 3,000+ private credit investments with ~20 analysts. UBS Chairman Kelleher: "massive growth in small rating agencies ticking the box" |
| **Regulatory** | 🟡 Emerging | Warren calling for capital requirements + stress tests. BOE running first private markets stress test |

### Creditor abuse: liability management exercises (LMEs)

PE-backed borrowers increasingly restructure debt in ways that slash creditor value while preserving sponsor equity — the opposite of traditional priority. In 2024, a record **33 US companies** with $500M+ debt restructured this way; **23 did so in 2025**.

| Company | Sponsor | What happened |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| [[Tropicana Brands]] | PAI Partners | Cut debt value 30%+, PAI kept full ownership, extracted more cash from lenders |
| Wellness Pet | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| GoTo Group | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| [[Rackspace]] | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| Del Monte Foods | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| [[Saks Global]] | — | Bondholders found restructuring loopholes, debt tanked 40%, bankruptcy Jan 14 2026 |
| [[First Brands Group]] | — | $10B bankruptcy (Sept 2025), fraud alleged, lenders included [[Jefferies]] and [[UBS]] |
| [[Renovo Home Partners]] | — | [[BlackRock]] marked loan at 100 cents, bankrupt one month later, total $150M loss |

## Key theses

| Thesis | Note | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Software as concentration risk | [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] | Active — OBDC II gate validated |
| Retail liquidity mismatch | [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] | Active — first gate occurred |
| Covenant erosion storing losses | [[Private credit]] | Slow burn — untested in recession |
| AI infrastructure financing | [[AI infrastructure financing]] | Bull case — Blue Owl Meta $30B |

---

## Sector dynamics

**Bull case:**
- $1.8T → $3.5T growth trajectory
- Banks retreating from risky lending → private credit fills gap
- Hyperscaler AI infrastructure needs off-balance-sheet financing
- Floating rates = yields adjust with Fed
- Strong management fee streams (1-2% of AUM)

**Bear case:**
- Retail liquidity crisis unfolding — first gate occurred Feb 2026
- Software concentration at all-time levels as AI disrupts borrowers
- Covenant-lite erosion removes early warning tools
- Opacity masks real losses until too late
- Regulatory crackdown could constrain fundraising
- Banks re-entering the market (JPMorgan, Goldman, SocGen)
