## Origins & how it works

Traces to 1980s insurance companies lending directly to corporates. Post-2008 regulations clamped down on risky bank lending → private credit filled the gap. Low rates drove a global hunt for yield; PE firms bought 20,000+ companies from 2009-2021 (~$2.5T market value), all needing debt. Rising rates from 2022 turbocharged appetite further — floating-rate private credit suddenly yielded 12-13%. Stephen Schwarzman (2023): "If you are living in a no-growth economy and somebody can give you 12%, 13% with almost no prospect of loss, that's about the best thing you can do."

### Lending strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Direct lending** | Loans held to maturity, solo or small group |
| **Distressed debt** | Buy debt trading below par, profit on restructuring |
| **Venture debt** | Loans to pre-profit startups (revenue multiples) |
| **Mezzanine** | Higher-risk debt between senior loans and equity |
| **Special situations** | Event-driven (M&A, bankruptcy, spin-off) |

### Why borrowers choose private credit

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Credit flexibility** | Accommodates borrowers ineligible for bank loans |
| **Pricing certainty** | Set upfront (vs fluctuating syndicated loan pricing) |
| **Execution speed** | Easier than traded leveraged loans |
| **PIK option** | Payment-in-kind = defer interest payments |

### Traditional advantages over bank lending (eroding)

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Maintenance covenants** | Limits on leverage tested regularly |
| **Information access** | Non-public financials from borrowers |
| **Relationship lending** | Direct line to management |
| **Early warning** | Covenant breach = intervention trigger |

If borrower breaches covenants: demand equity injection from PE sponsor, force asset sales, require more collateral, or initiate restructuring. **These tools are being lost** — see covenant erosion below.

| [[TPG]] | TPG | Various | Multiple vehicles | Growing credit arm |
| ICG | — | Various | Middle-market | Covenant discipline holdout |

### Banks re-entering the market

Banks are fighting back — offering cheaper deals, fewer covenants, and creating own private credit funds.

| Bank | Private credit activity |
|------|------------------------|
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | Own fund, advisory |
| Societe Generale | Own fund |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | Goldman Sachs AM |

Competition between banks and private credit may encourage riskier deals ([[Moody's]] warning).

## Alt manager sell-off (since Jan 2025)

![[owl-vs-bx-vs-ares-vs-apo-vs-kkr-vs-cg-vs-tpg-price-chart.png]]

*All 7 alt managers normalized from Jan 2025. OWL (Blue Owl, blue) is the worst performer at ~-50%, driven by the OBDC II gate. KKR and ARES cluster around -27 to -30%. BX, APO around -20%. CG (Carlyle) is the relative outperformer, having peaked +30% in Sept 2025 before pulling back to -20%. TPG also hit hard at -30%+. The Feb 2026 selloff is visible as a sharp synchronized drop across all names — but OWL's collapse is in a different league.*

![[alt-managers-selloff-feb2026.jpg]]

*Source: LSEG via FT, rebased from Jan 6, 2026. TPG worst (-38%), Ares (-35%), Blue Owl (-28%), KKR (-25%), Apollo (-22%), Blackstone (-20%).*

## BDC price comparison

![[obdc-vs-arcc-price-chart.png]]

*OBDC (Blue Owl, blue) vs ARCC (Ares, red) normalized from Jan 2020. ARCC has roughly doubled (+100%) while OBDC is up ~20% — the gap widened sharply in Feb 2026 after the OBDC II gate. ARCC is the largest public BDC ($26B+) and the benchmark for the sector; OBDC's underperformance reflects Blue Owl-specific risk (redemption crisis, software concentration fears).*

## Active crisis: [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]]

**Status: Unfolding** (Feb 2026 →)

The retail model is breaking. After 5 years of selling illiquid loans as "bond alternatives with quarterly liquidity," the industry faces accelerating redemptions.

| Fund | AUM | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| OBDC II ([[Blue Owl]]) | $1.7B | 🔴 **Gated** (Feb 19) |
| OBDC ([[Blue Owl]]) | $16B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| ARCC ([[Ares Management]]) | $26B+ | 🟡 Watching |
| BCRED ([[Blackstone]]) | $50B+ | 🟡 Watching |

**Next test:** March 31 quarter-end — redemption requests hit all semi-liquid funds simultaneously.

**Key event notes:**
- [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] — master event
- [[Blue Owl OBDC II redemption gate]] — first instance

### Retail expansion: how we got here

Private credit was historically institutional-only. From 2020-2025, PE firms aggressively pushed semi-liquid vehicles to retail/HNW investors — an $80T capital pool.

| Firm | Product | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| [[Blackstone]] | **BCRED** | $37.8B in ~1 year, non-traded BDC |
| [[Blackstone]] | Luxembourg fund | First European wealthy individual fund (2022) |
| [[Apollo]] | European platform | Full suite for individuals |
| [[Goldman Sachs]] | European fund | Retail client business focus |

**Structures:** BDCs (publicly traded), non-traded BDCs (Blackstone innovation, quarterly 5% redemption cap), perpetual vehicles.

**The fundamental contradiction:**
- **What was sold:** "Bond-like yields (8-12%) with quarterly liquidity"
- **What exists:** Illiquid loans to middle-market companies that can't be sold quickly without losses
- **What happens under stress:** Honoring redemptions benefits early redeemers at remaining investors' expense → classic bank run dynamics → gate

## Structural risks

| Risk | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Retail liquidity mismatch** | 🔴 Active | Illiquid loans in "quarterly liquid" wrappers. OBDC II broke first |
| **Software concentration** | 🟡 Elevated | 14-16% of spec-grade. AI disruption compressing valuations |
| **Covenant erosion / LMEs** | 🟡 Trending | 33 creditor-harming restructurings in 2024, 23 in 2025 ($500M+ debt each). Cov-lite creeping into middle market |
| **Opacity / valuation lag** | 🟡 Structural | [[BlackRock]] marked [[Renovo Home Partners]] at 100 cents; bankrupt one month later, total loss on $150M |
| **Bank interconnection** | 🟡 Growing | US bank exposure to private debt vehicles: **$300B** (Moody's, Oct 2025) |
| **Insurer interconnection** | 🟡 Growing | US life insurer exposure to illiquid credit: **$2T** (Moody's). [[PE-insurance convergence]] deepening |
| **Ratings shopping** | 🟡 Emerging | SEC probing [[Egan-Jones]] — rated 3,000+ private credit investments with ~20 analysts. UBS Chairman Kelleher: "massive growth in small rating agencies ticking the box" |
| **Regulatory** | 🟡 Emerging | Warren calling for capital requirements + stress tests. BOE running first private markets stress test |

### Creditor abuse: liability management exercises (LMEs)

PE-backed borrowers increasingly restructure debt in ways that slash creditor value while preserving sponsor equity — the opposite of traditional priority. In 2024, a record **33 US companies** with $500M+ debt restructured this way; **23 did so in 2025**.

| Company | Sponsor | What happened |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| [[Tropicana Brands]] | PAI Partners | Cut debt value 30%+, PAI kept full ownership, extracted more cash from lenders |
| Wellness Pet | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| GoTo Group | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| [[Rackspace]] | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| Del Monte Foods | PE-backed | Similar LME |
| [[Saks Global]] | — | Bondholders found restructuring loopholes, debt tanked 40%, bankruptcy Jan 14 2026 |
| [[First Brands Group]] | — | $10B bankruptcy (Sept 2025), fraud alleged, lenders included [[Jefferies]] and [[UBS]] |
| [[Renovo Home Partners]] | — | [[BlackRock]] marked loan at 100 cents, bankrupt one month later, total $150M loss |

### Covenant erosion details

Cov-lite — once confined to mega-deals — is spreading into middle market.

| Trend | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Cov-lite becoming common | Large borrowers pushing for and getting looser terms |
| Middle-market CLO cov-lite cap | 16% (2021) → **25%** (2025 Q1) — [[S&P Global]] |
| 2026 acceleration expected | Lenders competing for deal flow |

**Recent cov-lite deals (Jan 2026):**

| Deal | Sponsor | Lenders |
|------|---------|---------|
| JTC Plc | [[Permira]] + CPPIB | [[Blackstone]], CVC Credit, [[GIC]] |
| The Key Group | [[Permira]] | Goldman Sachs AM, Macquarie, Apax Credit |
| Global Gruppe | — | Various (€1B cov-lite offers) |

**Ben Davis (Eversheds Sutherland):** "In 2026 I expect some private credit lenders will increasingly agree to looser or no covenants in order to win business."

**Amin Doulai (King & Spalding):** "Nothing beats proper covenants and contractual protections when things get difficult... when a company starts to underperform and it's defaulting on its loans, you'll find that the direct line isn't open anymore."

**Peter Lockhead (ICG):** "We are not afraid to walk away from deals where we are not comfortable with the documentation." Some mid-market lenders still securing conventional covenants, but competitive pressure intensifying.

### Valuation opacity

Quarterly marks by the lender who holds the debt — no trading, no market price. Losses stay hidden until forced recognition.

**[[Renovo Home Partners]] case (Nov 2025):** [[BlackRock]] marked Renovo's debt at 100 cents on the dollar. The company was already failing to make interest payments. One month later, bankruptcy. Total loss on $150M.

**Ludovic Phalippou (Oxford Saïd):** "The real risk in private credit is not a sudden explosion, it's a slow burn — losses that stay hidden for a long time, then show up quietly in lower returns, weaker insurer balance sheets and disappointed savers, without ever triggering a classic financial crisis."

**[[UBS]] Chairman Colm Kelleher (late 2023):** Warning of "dangerous bubble" in private credit.

---

## Software concentration risk (Feb 2026)

The biggest emerging risk — software/tech is now the largest sector concentration, and AI disruption threatens the underlying cash flows.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Software share of BDC investments | ~17% by deal count (#2 sector) | PitchBook |
| Software in speculative-grade credit | $597B-$681B (14-16%) | Deutsche Bank |
| Default rate — aggressive AI disruption | **13%** (vs 8% lev loans, 4% HY) | UBS |
| Software share of PIK loans | #1 sector | PitchBook LCD |

**The mechanism:** PE firms loaded up on software buyout debt since 2020 — attracted by recurring revenue, high margins, sticky customers. But AI (especially agentic AI) threatens to replicate what enterprise software charges for, weakening cash flows → defaults rise.

**Trigger (Feb 2026):** Anthropic's new AI tools sparked a software selloff. Private credit stocks followed: [[Ares Management]] -12%, [[Blue Owl]] -8%, [[KKR]] -10%, [[TPG]] -7%.

**Still lending:** Despite warnings, firms keep deploying — Blue Owl led $1.4B for OneStream (Hg buyout), Ares leading €1.4B for EG A/S (Scandinavian software). The incentive structures haven't changed.

**Jamie Dimon's "cockroaches"** (late 2025): Stress in one borrower signals more hidden trouble. Software PIK loans are the tell — borrowers deferring interest payments because cash flows aren't there.

---

## Regulatory landscape

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **US (SEC)** | Rules for external audits struck down by federal court. Warren pushing capital requirements + stress tests |
| **US (SEC — Egan-Jones)** | Probing ratings shopping — 3,000+ ratings with ~20 analysts |
| **[[EU]]** | Caps on leverage, diversification requirements |
| **[[UK]] (FCA)** | Reviewing private market valuations |
| **BOE** | First stress test of private markets companies |
| **FSB** | Concerned about ratings shopping in private markets |
| **IMF / ECB** | Questioning bank-private credit fund relationships |

**Key gap:** No widespread moves to regulate like deposit-taking banks. Governments see private credit as absorbing risk inappropriate for banks.

---

## Recession resilience — unknown

**Fed (May 2023):** Not worried, but lack of transparency makes systemic risk hard to assess.

**Private credit argument:** Capital locked in longer than bank deposits. Stronger underwriting. Floating rates adjust.

**Reality:** No one knows. Industry untested through major recession since its 2008+ growth. Covenant-lite trend removes early warning tools. Bill Ammons (AlbaCore Capital): "I'm not going to say this is entirely 2007-like, but there are similarities. When companies have easy access to credit, it reinforces the need for a selective approach."

Marc Rowan (Apollo CEO, Nov 2025): "People have really just lost their minds, and the headlines get more and more hysterical." Said much growth is in investment-grade assets with lower default risk.

## Key theses

| Thesis | Note | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Software as concentration risk | [[Private Credit Software Concentration]] | Active — OBDC II gate validated |
| Retail liquidity mismatch | [[Private credit retail liquidity crisis 2026]] | Active — first gate occurred |
| Covenant erosion storing losses | (this note) | Slow burn — untested in recession |
| AI infrastructure financing | [[AI infrastructure financing]] | Bull case — Blue Owl Meta $30B |

---

## Sector dynamics

**Bull case:**
- $1.8T → $3.5T growth trajectory
- Banks retreating from risky lending → private credit fills gap
- Hyperscaler AI infrastructure needs off-balance-sheet financing
- Floating rates = yields adjust with Fed
- Strong management fee streams (1-2% of AUM)

**Bear case:**
- Retail liquidity crisis unfolding — first gate occurred Feb 2026
- Software concentration at all-time levels as AI disrupts borrowers
- Covenant-lite erosion removes early warning tools
- Opacity masks real losses until too late
- Regulatory crackdown could constrain fundraising
- Banks re-entering the market (JPMorgan, Goldman, SocGen)
- "Slow burn" risk — losses hidden in insurer balance sheets and disappointed savers (Phalippou)

## Watchlist / key dates

| Date | Event | Why it matters |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Mar 31, 2026** | Quarter-end redemption window | All semi-liquid funds face requests simultaneously |
| **Apr 2026** | Stanger Q1 redemption report | Did $2.9B/quarter accelerate? |
| **Quarterly** | ARCC, OBDC earnings | Credit quality indicators |
| **TBD** | Warren legislation | Capital requirements, disclosure, stress tests |
| **Ongoing** | Software default rates | Currently 4.55%. Deutsche Bank models 13% worst case |
| **Ongoing** | PIK loan growth | Software is #1 PIK sector — borrowers can't service cash interest |
