**Residential Mortgage** — $12.5T US market. **Non-banks dominate** — 66% of originations, 63% of servicing. GSE securitization (Fannie/Freddie) enables 30-year fixed rate. Highly rate-sensitive, consolidating rapidly.

## Market structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Debt outstanding | ~$12.5T |
| 2024 origination volume | ~$1.7T |
| Non-bank origination share | **66%** (2025) |
| Top 10 originator share | **43%** (up from 38% in 2023) |
| GSE market share | ~70% of securitization |

---

## Insights

- **Non-banks won** — From 4% of servicing (2008) to 63% today. Banks retreated post-GFC due to regulatory burden; non-banks filled the gap with technology and speed.
- **Consolidation accelerating** — Top 10 share grew from 38% (2023) → 43% (2025). Scale matters for technology investment and margin compression.
- **Rate sensitivity is existential** — Origination volume swings 50%+ with rates. Refi-dependent models (Rocket) suffer most in high-rate environments.

## Loan types

### By guarantor

| Type | Guarantor | Down payment | Credit | Who uses |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Conventional conforming** | [[Fannie Mae]]/[[Freddie Mac]] | 3-20% | 620+ | Most borrowers |
| **Jumbo** | None (portfolio/private) | 10-20% | 700+ | High-cost markets |
| **FHA** | FHA (HUD) | 3.5% | 580+ | First-time, lower credit |
| **VA** | VA (Dept of Veterans) | **0%** | None | Veterans, military |
| **USDA** | USDA | 0% | 640+ | Rural areas |

**Conforming loan limit (2025):** $806,500 (most areas), $1.21M in high-cost markets.

### By rate structure

| Type | Rate | Monthly payment | Who prefers |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Fixed-rate** | Locked for life | Stable | Most US borrowers (~90%) |
| **ARM (adjustable)** | Fixed intro, then adjusts | Variable | Short-term holders, rate bettors |

**US is unusual:** Fixed-rate dominates (~90%). Most countries use ARMs. GSE system enables 30-year fixed.

### By purpose

| Type | Purpose | Volume driver |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Purchase** | Buy home | Housing transactions |
| **Rate/term refinance** | Lower rate or change term | Rate drops |
| **Cash-out refinance** | Extract equity | Home prices, rates |

**Current mix (2025):** Purchase-heavy due to high rates killing refi demand.

## Non-bank vs bank

| Factor | Non-banks | Banks |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Market share (origination) | **66%** | 29% |
| Market share (servicing) | **63%** | 37% |
| Funding cost | Higher | Lower (deposits) |
| Speed | Faster (tech-enabled) | Slower |
| Regulation | Less | More (Basel, stress tests) |
| Rate sensitivity | Higher | Lower |

**Why non-banks won:**
- Banks retreated post-GFC (regulatory burden, reputational risk)
- Non-banks invested in technology, digital applications
- Speed advantage in low-rate environments (refi booms)

**Non-bank risk:** Higher funding costs hurt when rates rise; reliant on warehouse lines.

## GSEs and securitization

| Entity | Role | Market share |
|--------|------|--------------|
| [[Fannie Mae]] | Buys/guarantees conventional conforming | ~30% |
| [[Freddie Mac]] | Buys/guarantees conventional conforming | ~25% |
| [[Ginnie Mae]] | Guarantees FHA/VA/USDA MBS | ~15% |
| Private label | Non-agency securitization | ~5% |
| Portfolio | Banks hold on balance sheet | ~25% |

See [[GSE reform]] for privatization discussion.

## Servicing

| Servicer | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| [[Mr. Cooper]] | Non-bank | Largest non-bank servicer |
| [[Pennymac]] | Non-bank | Originate + service |
| [[Freedom Mortgage]] | Non-bank | FHA/VA specialist |
| [[Wells Fargo]] | Bank | Exiting, selling MSRs |
| [[JPMorgan Chase]] | Bank | Retaining |

**MSR economics:** Servicers earn ~25bps annually on unpaid balance. MSRs rise in value when rates rise (less prepayment).

---

## Rate sensitivity

| Environment | Origination | Servicing | Who wins |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Rates falling** | Refi boom, volume surges | MSRs lose value (prepay) | Originators |
| **Rates rising** | Volume collapses | MSRs gain value | Servicers, MSR holders |
| **Rates stable** | Purchase-driven | Stable | Balanced |

**Current (2025):** High rates → weak origination, strong MSR values, consolidation.

---

## Consolidation

| Acquirer | Target | Date | Rationale |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| [[Rocket Companies]] | [[Mr. Cooper]] | 2025 (closed Oct) | Add servicing scale |
| [[Rocket Companies]] | [[Redfin]] | 2025 (pending) | Purchase lead gen |
| [[UWM]] | — | — | Organic growth |

**Thesis:** Scale needed for technology investment, margin compression. Subscale players exit or sell.

---

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Non-bank consolidation creates scale winners
- Rate cuts → refi boom → volume surge
- Technology moats widening
- MSR values attractive in high-rate environment

**Bear case:**
- Rate sensitivity creates earnings volatility
- Non-bank funding risk in stress
- GSE reform uncertainty
- Margin compression continues

**Related public equities:**
- [[Rocket Companies]] (RKT) — #2 originator
- [[UWM]] (UWMC) — #1 originator
- [[loanDepot]] (LDI) — struggling
- [[Pennymac]] (PFSI) — correspondent + servicing
- [[Mr. Cooper]] (COOP) — acquired by Rocket Oct 2025
