# AI Compute

TSMC + its largest AI/compute customers. Trades as a tight cluster (0.60 avg correlation) because TSMC's fate is tied to AI chip demand.

*TSM-NVDA track closely (0.69 correlation). AMD lagged but recovering — different competitive position despite same foundry.*

## Key actors

| Company | Role | Position |
|---------|------|----------|
| [[TSMC]] | Foundry | Manufactures for NVDA, AMD |
| [[NVIDIA]] | AI GPUs | #1 TSMC customer, AI leader |
| [[AMD]] | CPUs + GPUs | #2 TSMC customer, NVDA challenger |

## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.61** | Strong (tight cluster) |
| Range | 0.56 - 0.69 | AMD-TSM to NVDA-TSM |
| vs Connectivity cluster | ~0.35 | Moderate separation |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| TSM - NVDA | **0.69** |
| TSM - AMD | 0.56 |
| NVDA - AMD | 0.57 |

TSMC's stock moves with its AI customers, not "foundry peers."

## Why this cluster exists

**TSMC's revenue concentration:**
- NVDA is TSMC's largest customer (~25% of revenue)
- AMD is #2-3 customer
- AI/HPC is TSMC's highest-margin segment

**Shared demand driver:**
- All three benefit from AI infrastructure buildout
- [[AI hyperscalers]] capex flows to NVDA GPUs → manufactured by TSMC
- AMD taking share in AI → also manufactured by TSMC

**The insight:** "Foundry" isn't a sector. TSMC is effectively a levered bet on NVDA + AMD demand.
