# Defense IT Services

Government and defense IT services contractors. Distinct from hardware primes — services-based business model with cost-plus contracts, civilian agency exposure, and recurring revenue. Trades as a tight cluster (0.61 correlation).

## Competitive dynamics

| Factor | Winners | Losers |
|--------|---------|--------|
| AI capabilities | Booz Allen, Palantir | Legacy IT shops |
| Clearance workforce | Incumbents | New entrants |
| Scale for large IDIQs | Leidos, GDIT | Small contractors |
| Agile M&A | Private (Peraton, ManTech) | Slower public cos |
| Price aggression | PE-backed | Public margin pressure |

**PE ownership advantage:** Private companies (Peraton/Veritas, ManTech/Carlyle) can bid aggressively without quarterly earnings pressure.

**Bear case:**
- [[DOGE]] contract scrutiny
- Recompete risk always present
- Margin pressure from PE-backed competitors
- Labor market for cleared talent
