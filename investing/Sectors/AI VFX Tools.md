# AI VFX Tools

AI tools that augment traditional film/TV production pipelines — VFX, animation, pre-visualization, compositing, and post-production. Not replacing filmmakers (see [[AI-Native Studios]]) but making them faster and cheaper.

## Deep dives

### Wonder Dynamics → Autodesk Flow Studio

Co-founded 2017 by **Nikola Todorovic** and **Tye Sheridan** (actor, *Ready Player One*). Advisory board: Steven Spielberg, Joe Russo. Raised $12.5M before acquisition.

**Acquired by [[Autodesk]] (ADSK) May 2024.** Full staff joined Autodesk.

| Product | Launch | Capability |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Wonder Studio | 2023 | CG characters into live-action |
| Wonder Animation | Oct 2024 | Video → animated scenes with CG characters in 3D |
| **Autodesk Flow Studio** | Mar 2025 (rebrand) | Full pipeline: AI mocap → animation → lighting → compositing |
| Freemium access | Aug 2025 (SIGGRAPH) | Removes cost barriers for indie filmmakers |

**Key capability:** Markerless AI motion capture — no suits, no markers, no expensive studio. Exports to Maya, Blender, Unreal Engine, 3ds Max via USD format.

**Investment angle:** [[Autodesk]] (ADSK) — Flow Studio is a growth driver for their media & entertainment division.

### LTX Studio (Lightricks)

**[[Lightricks]]** — Israeli company, founded 2013, ~600 employees, $1.8B valuation. Known for Facetune and Videoleap. $130M Series D (2021, led by Insight Partners). Investors include Goldman Sachs Growth Equity.

CEO **Zeev Farbman** and co-founders Nir Pochter, Yaron Inger, Amit Goldstein, Itai Tsiddon.

**LTX Studio** — browser-based end-to-end AI filmmaking platform. Converts text/scripts into storyboards, animated sequences, and polished pitch decks. Persistent character profiles solve the consistency problem (a major pain point in AI video).

| Model | Date | Note |
|-------|------|------|
| LTXV-13B | May 2025 | Open-source video model |
| LTX-2 | Oct 2025 | Latest open-source release |
| Veo 3 integration | 2025 | [[Google]] DeepMind audio-visual generation |

**Open-source strategy** differentiates from closed competitors — builds community and ecosystem.

### Flawless

AI-assisted performance editing for localization and dubbing. Meets **TPN security standards** — critical for major studio trust (studios won't send footage to tools that can't guarantee security).

Enables seamless dubbing without reshoots — AI modifies lip movements to match translated dialogue while preserving the original performance. Used by major studios (specific deals undisclosed).

### Waymark

Founded 2010 by **Nathan Labenz** and **Jay Gierak**. ~$6M total funding. ~47 employees.

AI platform generating TV ad spots from plain-language instructions. Targets **small businesses** that can't afford traditional $15K–$30K cost of a 30-second commercial.

| Partner | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| E.W. Scripps | Rolling out across TV stations |
| Fox TV Stations | AI ad creation |
| Spectrum Reach | Cable ad generation |
| Gray Television | Local TV |
| Beasley Media Group | Radio/TV |

Worked with [[OpenAI]] to develop targeted ad production platform.

**Business model:** Enable local TV stations to offer affordable ad creation to SMBs, expanding their advertiser base.

### EDGLRD (Harmony Korine)

Acclaimed filmmaker Harmony Korine's AI-native production company. Produced *Aggro Dr1ft* (2023) — one of the first feature-length films using AI throughout production. Uses [[Runway]] tools. Represents the "auteur" end of AI filmmaking — artistic experimentation rather than efficiency.

---

## TCL Film Machine Program

**TCL Studios** (U.S. division of Chinese electronics giant) runs the **Film Machine** AI development program — provides AI tools, financial support, and production resources to filmmakers.

5 AI-assisted short films premiered at TCL Chinese Theater (Nov 2025), launched on TCLtv+ FAST service (Dec 2025). Led by Haohong Wang (GM, TCL Research America).

## Where AI fits in the production pipeline

| Stage | Traditional | AI-augmented |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Pre-production** | Storyboards, concept art | AI-generated storyboards, pre-viz ([[LTX Studio]]) |
| **Production** | Motion capture suits, sets | Markerless AI mocap ([[Autodesk]] Flow Studio) |
| **VFX** | Manual compositing, rotoscoping | AI character insertion, lighting (Flow Studio) |
| **Post-production** | Manual editing, color | AI-assisted editing |
| **Localization** | Reshoots, ADR dubbing | AI lip-sync dubbing ([[Flawless]]) |
| **Distribution** | Per-market cuts | Personalized versions at scale |

---

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| VFX automation | [[Autodesk]] (ADSK) — Flow Studio |
| AI filmmaking platform | [[Lightricks]] (private) |
| AI localization | [[Flawless]] (private) |
| Local TV disruption | [[Waymark]] (private) |
| Compute demand | [[NVIDIA]], [[AMD]] |

**Public exposure:** [[Autodesk]] (ADSK) is the only significant public play through Flow Studio. [[Adobe]] benefits indirectly through Luma AI integration and Synthesia investment.

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Union restrictions** | VFX artists' unions could push back on AI tools |
| **Quality trust** | Studios may not trust AI for hero shots |
| **Integration complexity** | Fitting AI tools into established pipelines is hard |
| **Commoditization** | Open-source models could erode tool pricing |
| **Autodesk dominance** | Flow Studio + existing Maya/3ds Max ecosystem could lock out startups |
