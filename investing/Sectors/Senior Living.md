# Senior Living

Nursing homes, assisted living, and senior housing — where healthcare meets real estate. Operators run facilities; REITs own the buildings. Both benefit from aging demographics but face labor shortages and reimbursement pressure.

## Market structure

### Operators

### Healthcare REITs

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | Portfolio | Focus |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-------|

## Why this sector matters

**Demographic tailwind.** The 80+ population grows 3.2% annually in 2025-2026, accelerating to 5.9% in 2027-2028. Baby Boomers are reshaping demand for senior living services.

**Occupancy recovery.** National senior housing occupancy reached 88.7% in Q3 2025 — the 17th consecutive quarter of increases. Independent living surpassed 90% for the first time since 2019. Industry expects >90% occupancy by end of 2026.

**Supply constrained.** Senior living units under construction at lowest level since Q1 2014. Annual inventory growth just 1.3% in Q4 2024. Demand outpacing supply.

## Facility types

| Type | Care Level | Typical Resident | Reimbursement |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Independent Living (IL)** | Minimal | Active seniors | Private pay |
| **Assisted Living (AL)** | Moderate | Help with daily activities | Mostly private pay |
| **Memory Care** | Specialized | Dementia/Alzheimer's | Private pay |
| **Skilled Nursing (SNF)** | Intensive | Post-acute, chronic care | Medicare/Medicaid |
| **Continuing Care (CCRC)** | Full spectrum | Aging in place | Private pay + healthcare |

**Key distinction:** Independent/assisted living = mostly private pay (real estate economics). Skilled nursing = Medicare/Medicaid dependent (healthcare economics + regulatory risk).

## Business models

### Operators (Brookdale, Ensign)

| Revenue Source | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Private pay** | Residents/families pay monthly fees |
| **Medicare** | Short-term skilled nursing (post-acute) |
| **Medicaid** | Long-term care for low-income (lowest rates) |
| **Managed Medicare** | Medicare Advantage plans |

**Margin drivers:** Occupancy (operating leverage), payer mix (Medicare > Medicaid), labor costs (60%+ of expenses).

### REITs (Welltower, Ventas, Omega)

| Lease Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Triple-net** | Tenant pays rent + taxes + insurance + maintenance |
| **SHOP** | REIT operates facility via third-party manager (higher risk/reward) |

**SHOP pivot:** Welltower and Ventas are shifting toward SHOP (Senior Housing Operating Portfolio) where they capture operating upside rather than just collecting rent. Welltower now >80% senior housing NOI; Ventas SHOP >50% of NOI.

REITs collect rent from operators. Risk: operator distress can lead to rent deferrals, restructurings, or facility transitions.

## Current themes (2025-2026)

### Occupancy inflection

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Senior housing overall | 88.7% | 17th consecutive quarter up |
| Independent living | 90.2% | First >90% since 2019 |
| Active adult (2+ years) | ~96% | Near full |
| Skilled nursing | ~77% | Recovering from 67% trough (2021) |

**2026 target:** Industry expects average occupancy to exceed 90% by year-end.

### Labor crisis

The sector faces severe staffing shortages:
- Health Resources and Services Administration projects 80,000 RN deficit in 2025
- CNA shortages even more acute
- Wage inflation pressuring margins
- New federal staffing mandates for SNFs

### Ensign's acquisition machine

Ensign Group completed 45 acquisitions in 2025, adding thousands of beds:
- Q3 alone: 22 acquisitions, 1,857 SNF beds, 109 senior living units
- December: Colorado, Kansas, Arizona facilities
- Decentralized model: local CEOs operate independently

Ensign targets distressed facilities, turns them around, creates value.

### Brookdale restructuring

Largest operator navigating debt refinancing:
- $263M net loss in 2025 (includes $71M impairment)
- Occupancy improving: 82.5% in Q4 2025 (up 310bps YoY)
- Targeting 550 communities by mid-2026 (from 584)
- Refinanced $600M of 2026-2027 debt in January 2026
- 2026 guidance: 8-9% RevPAR growth, up to $516M EBITDA

### Welltower and Ventas go "all-in"

The two giants are pivoting heavily toward senior housing:

**Welltower (WELL):**
- $14B deal to acquire 700+ senior living communities (2025)
- Sold $7.2B outpatient medical office portfolio to Kayne Anderson
- Post-sale: >80% of NOI from senior housing
- Acquired Amica Senior Lifestyles for CAD $4.6B (March 2025)
- Q3 2025 FFO: $1.34/share (+21% YoY)

**Ventas (VTR):**
- SHOP portfolio now >50% of NOI
- $2.2B in acquisitions in 2025
- Q3 2025 FFO: $0.88/share (+10% YoY)

### Other REIT dealmaking

- **Omega:** $1.1B in deals YTD 2025, invested in AI reimbursement optimization (MedaSync)
- **Sabra:** Targeting 40% SHOP exposure, exceeding $500M investment guidance
- **CareTrust:** $500M JV deal in late 2024

## Key metrics

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Occupancy** | Beds filled / total beds | Operating leverage |
| **RevPAR** | Revenue per available room | Pricing power + occupancy |
| **EBITDAR** | EBITDA + rent | Operator coverage |
| **EBITDAR coverage** | EBITDAR / rent | Can operator pay rent? |
| **Payer mix** | Medicare vs Medicaid vs private | Margin quality |
| **AFFO** | Adjusted FFO (REITs) | Dividend sustainability |

## Investment considerations

**Bull case:**
- Demographic tailwind (80+ population growth)
- Occupancy recovery with constrained supply
- Middle-market opportunity underserved
- REITs offer 6%+ yields with growth potential
- Ensign model proving scalable

**Bear case:**
- Labor shortages structural, not cyclical
- Medicaid reimbursement inadequate
- Operator distress risk (Brookdale, smaller players)
- Interest rate sensitivity (REITs)
- Regulatory risk (staffing mandates, reimbursement changes)

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Labor shortages** | Wage inflation, staffing mandates |
| **Medicaid rates** | State budget pressure → inadequate reimbursement |
| **Operator distress** | Rent deferrals, restructurings, transitions |
| **Interest rates** | REIT valuations, refinancing costs |
| **Medicare Advantage** | MA plans squeezing SNF reimbursement |
| **Regulatory** | Federal staffing requirements, state oversight |
