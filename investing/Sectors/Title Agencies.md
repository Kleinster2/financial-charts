**Title Agencies** — The distribution layer of [[Title Insurance]]. Agencies conduct title searches, handle closings, and place policies with underwriters. **Keep 80-85% of premium** — underwriters bear risk but agencies do the work and retain most economics.

## Agency vs underwriter

| Role | Function | Risk | Economics |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Agency** | Title search, closing, customer-facing | Operational (E&O liability) | **80-85% of premium** |
| **Underwriter** | Issues policy, pays claims | Insurance risk | 15-20% of premium |

**Why agencies keep so much:**
- Agencies perform nearly all underwriting work (title search, review, certification)
- Agency agreements shift E&O liability to the agent
- Underwriters avoid fixed costs by using agency distribution

**State variations:**
- Most states: 80-85% to agency
- Illinois, Michigan: Some 90-95% splits
- Florida: Capped at 70% (statutory)
- Connecticut: Capped at 60% (statutory)

## Market structure

### Thousands of agencies

Unlike underwriters (Big Four dominate), agencies are fragmented:
- Thousands of small, local agencies nationwide
- Regional players with multi-state footprint
- Few national independents

### Underwriter affiliation

Most agencies affiliate with 1-2 underwriters. Large commercial agencies maintain relationships with multiple underwriters for complex deals requiring co-insurance or large policy limits.

## Major independent agencies

| Agency | Revenue | Focus | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| [[Capital Title of Texas]] | **$103M** | Texas residential + commercial | **Largest independent agency in US**, 100+ branches |
| [[Madison Title Agency]] | ~$27M | Commercial, national | MCRES platform, 10K+ transactions/year |
| Title First | — | Commercial, national | All 50 states |
| California Title Company | — | West Coast | [[Berkshire Hathaway]] affiliate |

### Agent-only underwriters

These underwriters have **no direct operations** — they only work through independent agents, eliminating channel conflict:

| Underwriter | Share | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| [[Westcor Land Title]] | 4.2% | Largest agent-only |
| [[Alliant National]] | ~1% | Acquired by [[Dream Finders Homes]] (Apr 2025) |

**Note:** Big Four underwriters operate direct agency operations that compete with independent agents — a key driver of agent preference for agent-only underwriters. See [[Title Insurance]].

## Business model dynamics

### Why agencies matter

**Customer ownership:** Agencies own the customer relationship. Underwriters are invisible to most buyers/sellers. This gives agencies leverage in premium split negotiations.

**Referral networks:** Agencies build relationships with:
- Real estate agents/brokers
- Mortgage lenders
- Attorneys
- Builders/developers

**Repeat business:** Commercial agencies especially benefit from ongoing relationships with investors, developers, and institutional clients.

### Economics

| Revenue source | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Premium split | 80-85% of title insurance premium |
| Closing fees | Settlement/escrow fees |
| Ancillary services | 1031, due diligence, etc. |

**Margin drivers:**
- Volume (scale over fixed costs)
- Automation (digital closings, e-recording)
- Ancillary revenue (1031, escrow interest)

---

## Regulatory landscape

### RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act)

Prohibits kickbacks and fee-splitting for referrals. Agencies cannot pay real estate agents for referrals.

### State licensing

Agencies must be licensed in each state where they operate. Creates barrier to national expansion.

### Premium regulation

Some states regulate title insurance rates, affecting agency economics.

## Investment implications

**Not directly investable** — Most agencies are private, local businesses.

**Industry indicator:** Agency economics affect underwriter profitability:
- High agency splits = less premium retention for underwriters
- Split pressure in competitive markets
- Technology may shift power (underwriters investing in direct digital)

**Related public equities:**
- [[Fidelity National Financial]] — operates both direct and agency
- [[First American Financial]] — same
- [[Stewart Information Services]] — same
- [[Old Republic International]] — same
