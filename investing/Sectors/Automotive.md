## US pricing crisis

Average new car hit $50,326 (Dec 2025) — up 61% since 2010. Takes 36.2 weeks of household income, above pre-Covid norm. Buyers earning <$75,000 leaving market. US-made OEM average ([[GM]], [[Ford]], [[Stellantis]]): $54,380, 13% above industry.

Causes: SUV/truck shift killed affordable sedans, pandemic supply disruption, EV price premium (~$8K above average), tariff absorption, regulation-driven feature creep. Auto insurance +65% and repair costs +44% (5yr) compound ownership burden.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| EV price war | Margin compression |
| China competition | Market share loss |
| Tariffs | Supply chain disruption |
| UAW/labor | Cost pressure |
| Autonomy delays | Valuation reset |
| Affordability crisis | Sub-$75K buyers leaving new-car market — see [[US auto affordability]] |

## Regional dynamics

| Region | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| US | Truck/SUV focus, EV slow |
| Europe | Regulation-driven EV |
| China | Most competitive, EV leader |
| Japan | Hybrid focus, EV laggard |
| India | ICE dominant, EV transition blocked |

### India — losing to China

[[India]]'s auto industry faces structural EV disadvantage:

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Domestic players | Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki |
| EV penetration | Low (<5%) |
| Battery tech | Can't source — [[China battery leverage]] |
| Regional competition | Losing to [[BYD]] |

Nepal case study (Jan 2026):
- 75% of Nepal car sales are now EVs
- [[BYD]] is market leader
- Indian gasoline/diesel car dominance "evaporated"
- Indian EVs can't compete on quality or price

Why: India's 0.6% R&D spending (flat for 27 years) means no indigenous EV capability. Chinese tech transfer blocked. Pattern may repeat across South Asia.
