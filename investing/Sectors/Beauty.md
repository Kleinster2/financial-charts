# Beauty

The global beauty industry — skincare, fragrance, makeup, haircare — spanning mass to ultra-luxury. ~$670B global market (2024, Euromonitor), growing ~5% annually. US prestige beauty alone: $33.9B (+7% in 2024). Fragrance is the fastest-growing category (+12%), skincare the softest (+2%). The industry is bifurcating: luxury and dermatological brands thrive while mid-tier gets squeezed by mass dupes.
