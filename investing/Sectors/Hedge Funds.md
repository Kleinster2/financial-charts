| Global | 16% (up from 8% in 2024) |

### Market context

S&P 500 in 2025:
- **Feb:** Record highs
- **April:** Near bear-market lows
- **Dec:** Fresh record highs

Volatility from Trump's trade, fiscal, and geopolitical policies created price arbitrage for active managers.

### Industry flows

**Hedge fund assets at all-time highs**, supported by net inflows.

> "Overall, it has been a strong year for hedge funds across strategies, with decent alpha generation and recognition from allocators. Allocator sentiment toward hedge funds remains positive, and we see plenty of opportunities to explore in 2026."
> — Vanessa Bogaardt, Global Head of Capital Introduction, Bank of America

**Drivers:** AI rally + Trump trade war volatility = active trading profits.
