## Industry stats (2025)

| Region | Avg return |
|--------|------------|
| Asia | **24%** |
| EMEA | 16% |
| Global | 16% (up from 8% in 2024) |
| US | 12% |
| S&P 500 | 16% |

*Source: JPMorgan note to clients*

### Market context

S&P 500 in 2025:
- **Feb:** Record highs
- **April:** Near bear-market lows
- **Dec:** Fresh record highs

Volatility from Trump's trade, fiscal, and geopolitical policies created price arbitrage for active managers.

### Industry flows

**Hedge fund AUM at ~$5T** (Preqin, Jun 2025), but growth was almost entirely performance-driven. In the 5 years from Jun 2020 to Jun 2025, the industry received near-zero net new capital. Fundraising became a zero-sum game dominated by pod shops.

*[[Hedge fund capital concentration]]*

**Boutique revival (Jan 2026):** Several $1B+ fund debuts (stock-picking, credit derivatives) as Citadel/Millennium convergence opens allocator appetite.

**New fund launches:** Contracting for 4 consecutive years. Liquidations more frequent.

> "Overall, it has been a strong year for hedge funds across strategies, with decent alpha generation and recognition from allocators."
> — Vanessa Bogaardt, BofA Capital Introduction

**Drivers:** AI rally + Trump trade war volatility = active trading profits.

### Competition from private alternatives

![[hedge-fund-aum-vs-pe-private-credit.png]]
*[[Hedge fund capital concentration]]*

Hedge fund growth pales vs. private equity (~$7T) and private credit (~$2T, fastest relative growth from ~$0 in 2010). Private credit marketed as safer with handsome capital gains, but 2025 brought "cockroach" concerns (distressed companies in shadows) and systemic risk scrutiny.

See [[Hedge fund capital concentration]] for the structural dynamics.
