# Memory

Semiconductor memory — DRAM for active compute, NAND for storage. Cyclical but structurally transformed by AI/HBM demand.

## Industry structure

### Market share (Q3 2025, TrendForce)

**DRAM:**

| Rank | Company | Share |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [[Samsung]] | ~40% |
| 2 | [[SK Hynix]] | ~35% |
| 3 | [[Micron]] | ~25% |

**NAND:**

| Rank | Company | Share |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [[Samsung]] | 32.3% |
| 2 | [[SK Hynix]] + Solidigm | 19.3% |
| 3 | [[Kioxia]] | 15.3% |
| 4 | [[Micron]] | ~13% |
| 5 | [[SanDisk]] | 12.4% |

**HBM (High Bandwidth Memory):**

| Rank | Company | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [[SK Hynix]] | Clear leader, NVIDIA preferred |
| 2 | [[Samsung]] | Catching up |
| 3 | [[Micron]] | Ramping, NVIDIA qualified |

## Key products

| Type | Use case | Key metric |
|------|----------|------------|
| **DDR5** | PC, server RAM | Speed, capacity |
| **LPDDR5** | Mobile, laptop | Power efficiency |
| **[[HBM]]** | AI accelerators | Bandwidth (TB/s) |
| **Enterprise SSD** | Data centers | IOPS, endurance |
| **Consumer SSD** | PCs, gaming | $/GB |

## Current dynamics (2025-2026)

### [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]]

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Supply cuts | All majors cut production 2H25 |
| Pricing power | Samsung mulling 20-30% price hikes |
| Demand exceeds supply | [[Micron]]: meeting only 50-67% of key customer demand |
| Tight through 2026 | [[Micron]]: "tightness to persist through and beyond CY2026" |

### AI transformation

| Before AI | After AI |
|-----------|----------|
| Cyclical commodity | Structural demand from [[AI hyperscalers]] |
| PC/mobile driven | Data center driven |
| DRAM/NAND focus | [[HBM]] premium product |
| ~30% margins (trough) | 50%+ margins (peak) |

---

## Sector economics

| Metric | DRAM | NAND | HBM |
|--------|------|------|-----|
| Gross margin (cycle avg) | 40-50% | 30-40% | 50-60%+ |
| CapEx intensity | High | High | Very high |
| Concentration | 3 players | 5 players | 3 players |
| Cyclicality | High | High | Lower (contracted) |

---

## Geographic concentration

| Segment | Location | Risk |
|---------|----------|------|
| DRAM | Korea (75%+) | Moderate |
| NAND | Korea + Japan | Moderate |
| HBM | Korea (95%+) | High |
| China (CXMT, YMTC) | Domestic | Rising, [[Export controls]] limited |

---

## Investment theses

| Thesis | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Long memory]] | Shortage pricing, HBM structural growth |
| [[Short TSMC long Korea]] | Memory > logic relative value |

---

## Key actors

### Integrated (DRAM + NAND)
- [[Samsung]] — \#1 DRAM, \#1 NAND
- [[SK Hynix]] — \#2 DRAM, \#2 NAND (via Solidigm), \#1 HBM
- [[Micron]] — \#3 DRAM, \#4 NAND, \#3 HBM

### NAND specialists
- [[Kioxia]] — \#3 NAND, Japan-based, [[SanDisk]] JV
- [[SanDisk]] — \#5 NAND, pure-play post-WDC spinoff

### China challengers
- [[CXMT]] — DRAM, catching up
- YMTC — NAND, targeting 15% share by late 2026

## Geographic bifurcation

**Correlation analysis reveals two distinct trading clusters:**

| Cluster | Avg Correlation | Members |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| [[US Memory]] | 0.50 | [[Micron]], [[SanDisk]], [[Western Digital]] |
| [[Korea Memory]] | 0.56 | [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]] |
| Cross-region | **0.23** (weak) | US vs Korea |

Korean memory stocks move with Korean market/won, not US memory peers. For portfolio construction, these are **separate exposures**.

## Sub-sectors

### By geography

| Sub-sector | Correlation | Key actors | Characteristics |
|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| [[US Memory]] | 0.50 | [[Micron]], [[SanDisk]], [[Western Digital]] | CHIPS Act, USD, HBM \#3 |
| [[Korea Memory]] | 0.56 | [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]] | HBM dominant, KRW, China risk |

### By product

| Sub-sector | Focus | Sister concept |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| [[AI Storage]] | Enterprise SSD for AI | [[AI storage bottleneck]] |
| [[HBM]] | High-bandwidth for GPUs | [[Memory shortage 2025-2026]] |
