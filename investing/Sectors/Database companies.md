**Database companies** — Vendors providing database infrastructure, analytics platforms, and data management. Sub-sector with sister concept [[Data gravity]] explaining customer stickiness.

## Market structure

- **Hyperscaler managed services** dominate volume (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Pure-play vendors** compete on specialization and developer experience
- **Open source** commoditizes core features, pushes differentiation to tooling/scale

## Key players

### Analytics / Data warehousing
- [[Snowflake]] — cloud data warehouse, consumption pricing
- [[Databricks]] — lakehouse, Spark-native, AI/ML focus

### Transactional / Document
- [[MongoDB]] — document DB, Atlas managed service
- [[Oracle]] — legacy enterprise, cloud transition

### Emerging (not yet in vault)
- Cockroach Labs — distributed SQL (private)
- PlanetScale — serverless MySQL (private)
- Neon — serverless Postgres (private)
- Pinecone — vector database (private)
- Supabase — Postgres platform (private)

## Competitive dynamics

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Consumption pricing | Revenue volatility tied to customer workloads |
| Hyperscaler competition | AWS/Azure can undercut on integrated offerings |
| AI workloads | New growth vector, but unclear winner |
| Open source | Postgres/ClickHouse eroding moats |

## Thesis considerations

- Snowflake/Databricks duopoly in cloud analytics — watch for margin pressure
- MongoDB's Atlas growth vs document DB commoditization
- Vector DB market fragmented — likely consolidation or hyperscaler absorption
