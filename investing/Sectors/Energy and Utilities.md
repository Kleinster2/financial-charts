## Power generation mix

| Source | Share (US) | Trend |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Natural gas | ~40% | Stable |
| Coal | ~16% | Declining |
| Nuclear | ~19% | Stable → growing |
| Renewables | ~22% | Growing |
| Hydro | ~6% | Stable |

## Key players by segment

### Utilities (regulated)

| Company | Focus | AI exposure |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [[Duke Energy]] | Southeast | Data center growth |
| [[Dominion Energy]] | Virginia | Northern VA data centers |
| [[NextEra Energy]] | Florida, renewables | Clean energy PPAs |
| Southern Company | Southeast | Nuclear, data centers |
| Xcel Energy | Midwest | Wind/solar |

### Independent power producers (IPPs)

| Company | Focus | AI angle |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [[Constellation Energy]] | Nuclear fleet | Data center PPAs |
| [[Vistra]] | Gas + nuclear | Texas data center demand |
| NRG Energy | Retail + generation | — |
| AES | Renewables + storage | — |

### Nuclear

| Company | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| [[Constellation Energy]] | Existing fleet | Largest US operator |
| [[Vistra]] | Existing fleet | Texas exposure |
| [[Cameco]] | Uranium mining | Fuel supplier |
| [[Westinghouse]] | Reactor builder | AP1000 |
| [[NuScale]] | SMR developer | First US SMR license |
| [[Oklo]] | SMR developer | Sam Altman backed |

## AI power demand

### The problem

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Single H100 GPU | ~700W |
| 100K GPU cluster | ~100 MW |
| Hyperscaler campus | 500 MW - 2 GW |
| US data center load (2030E) | 35+ GW |

**Constraint:** Grid can't add capacity fast enough.

See [[Power constraints]].

### Solutions being pursued

| Solution | Timeline | Players |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Nuclear PPAs | Now | Constellation, Vistra |
| Gas peakers | Now | IPPs |
| Renewables + storage | 1-3 years | NextEra, AES |
| SMRs | 5-10 years | NuScale, Oklo |
| Fusion | 10+ years | Helion, Commonwealth |

## Investment themes

### Nuclear renaissance

| Thesis | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| Existing fleet value | Constellation, Vistra |
| Uranium demand | Cameco |
| New builds | Westinghouse (via Cameco/Brookfield) |
| SMRs | NuScale, Oklo (speculative) |

See [[Long nuclear]].

### Data center power

| Thesis | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| Utility demand growth | Dominion, Duke |
| IPP pricing power | Constellation, Vistra |
| Equipment | GE Vernova, Siemens Energy |

## Regulatory framework

| Regulation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Rate base** | Utilities earn regulated return |
| **PPA contracts** | IPP revenue visibility |
| **IRA incentives** | Nuclear/renewable tax credits |
| **NRC licensing** | SMR approval timeline |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **AI demand slowdown** | Power demand below forecasts |
| **Renewable intermittency** | Grid reliability |
| **Nuclear cost overruns** | New build economics |
| **Rate case outcomes** | Utility earnings |
| **Natural gas prices** | IPP margins |
