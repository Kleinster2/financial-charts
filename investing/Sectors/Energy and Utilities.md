# Energy and Utilities

Overview of power generation and utilities, with focus on AI-driven demand.

---

## Power generation mix

| Source | Share (US) | Trend |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Natural gas | ~40% | Stable |
| Coal | ~16% | Declining |
| Nuclear | ~19% | Stable → growing |
| Renewables | ~22% | Growing |
| Hydro | ~6% | Stable |

## Sector KPIs

| Metric | Definition | Good / Target | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Dividend Yield | Annual dividend / Share price | >3-4% (Utilities) | Income stability, value (Utilities) |
| P/E Ratio | Share price / Earnings per share | 15-20x (Utilities) | Valuation relative to earnings (Utilities) |
| P/FCF | Price / Free Cash Flow per share | <10x (Producers) | Valuation for cash-generative firms (Energy Producers) |
| Reserve Life | Proven Reserves / Annual Production | >10-15 years (E&P) | Longevity of resource base (Exploration & Production) |
| Capacity Factor | Actual output / Max possible output | >90% (Nuclear), >50% (Renewables) | Operational efficiency of power plants |
| AUM Growth (for fund managers) | Assets Under Management Growth | >10% annually | Indicates strong client acquisition (relevant for some energy funds) |

## AI power demand

### The problem

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Single H100 GPU | ~700W |
| 100K GPU cluster | ~100 MW |

| Solution | Timeline | Players |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Nuclear PPAs | Now | Constellation, Vistra |
| Gas peakers | Now | IPPs |
| Renewables + storage | 1-3 years | NextEra, AES |
| SMRs | 5-10 years | NuScale, Oklo |
| Fusion | 10+ years | Helion, Commonwealth |

## Investment themes

### Grid infrastructure super-cycle

Three independent drivers converging on grid buildout: AI power demand, climate resilience, and electrification. See [[Grid infrastructure super-cycle]].

| Driver | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| AI / data centers | [[Quanta Services]], [[Eaton]], [[GE Vernova]] |
| Climate hardening | [[LUMA Energy]] (Puerto Rico), [[PG&E]] undergrounding |
| Electrification | Renewable interconnection, EV charging |

### Nuclear renaissance

| Thesis | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| Existing fleet value | Constellation, Vistra |
| Uranium demand | Cameco |
| New builds | Westinghouse (via Cameco/Brookfield) |
| SMRs | NuScale, Oklo (speculative) |

See [[Long nuclear]].

### Data center power

| Thesis | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| Utility demand growth | Dominion, Duke |
| IPP pricing power | Constellation, Vistra |
| Equipment | GE Vernova, Siemens Energy |
| Grid buildout | [[Quanta Services]], [[Eaton]] |

### Grid privatization

| Thesis | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| T&D concessions | [[LUMA Energy]] (Puerto Rico model) |
| Grid contractors | [[Quanta Services]] |
| Distressed utility debt | [[PREPA]] bonds (~80% haircut proposed) |

---

## Regulatory framework

| Regulation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Rate base | Utilities earn regulated return |
| PPA contracts | IPP revenue visibility |
| IRA incentives | Nuclear/renewable tax credits |
| NRC licensing | SMR approval timeline |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| AI demand slowdown | Power demand below forecasts |
| Renewable intermittency | Grid reliability |
| Nuclear cost overruns | New build economics |
| Rate case outcomes | Utility earnings |

## Software-to-energy rotation (Feb 2026)

US energy sector up 17% YTD as capital rotates out of software on AI disruption fears. XLE +24% vs IGV -20% over 12 months (~44pp divergence). US majors trade at >75% EV/EBITDA premium to European peers.

See [[AI workflow disruption basket]] for the other side of this trade.
