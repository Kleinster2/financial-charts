# Energy and Utilities

Overview of power generation and utilities, with focus on AI-driven demand.

---

## Power generation mix

| Source | Share (US) | Trend |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Natural gas | ~40% | Stable |
| Coal | ~16% | Declining |
| Nuclear | ~19% | Stable → growing |
| Renewables | ~22% | Growing |
| Hydro | ~6% | Stable |

## Sector KPIs

| Metric | Definition | Good / Target | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Dividend Yield | Annual dividend / Share price | >3-4% (Utilities) | Income stability, value (Utilities) |
| P/E Ratio | Share price / Earnings per share | 15-20x (Utilities) | Valuation relative to earnings (Utilities) |
| P/FCF | Price / Free Cash Flow per share | <10x (Producers) | Valuation for cash-generative firms (Energy Producers) |
| Reserve Life | Proven Reserves / Annual Production | >10-15 years (E&P) | Longevity of resource base (Exploration & Production) |
| Capacity Factor | Actual output / Max possible output | >90% (Nuclear), >50% (Renewables) | Operational efficiency of power plants |
| AUM Growth (for fund managers) | Assets Under Management Growth | >10% annually | Indicates strong client acquisition (relevant for some energy funds) |

## AI power demand

### The problem

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Single H100 GPU | ~700W |
| 100K GPU cluster | ~100 MW |
| Hyperscaler campus | 500 MW - 2 GW |
| US data center load (2030E) | 35+ GW |

Constraint: Grid can't add capacity fast enough.

See [[Power constraints]].

### Solutions being pursued

| Solution | Timeline | Players |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Nuclear PPAs | Now | Constellation, Vistra |
| Gas peakers | Now | IPPs |
| Renewables + storage | 1-3 years | NextEra, AES |
