# Connectivity

Networking and connectivity semiconductor cluster. AVGO, QCOM, MRVL trade together (0.58 avg correlation), separate from AI/Compute cluster.

![[connectivity-sector-chart.png]]
*AVGO outperforming (+265% since 2024) on AI networking exposure. QCOM and MRVL lagging but moving together.*

## Key actors

| Company | Focus | Position |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [[Broadcom]] | Networking ASICs, switching | Diversified, Apple modem win |
| [[Qualcomm]] | Mobile modems, RF | Mobile connectivity leader |
| [[Marvell]] | Data center networking, storage | Cloud infrastructure |

## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.58** | Moderate-strong (valid cluster) |
| Range | 0.55 - 0.63 | AVGO-QCOM to AVGO-MRVL |
| vs AI/Compute cluster | ~0.35 | Distinct clusters |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| AVGO - MRVL | **0.63** |
| AVGO - QCOM | 0.55 |
| QCOM - MRVL | 0.55 |

## Why this cluster exists

**Shared end markets:**
- Data center networking (all three)
- 5G infrastructure (QCOM, MRVL)
- Enterprise connectivity (AVGO, MRVL)

**Different from AI/Compute:**
- Less tied to GPU/AI accelerator demand
- More diversified revenue (mobile, enterprise, auto)
- Different TSMC dependency (less cutting-edge)

## vs AI/Compute cluster

| Metric | AI/Compute | Connectivity |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Avg correlation | 0.61 | 0.58 |
| TSMC dependency | Very high (N3, N4) | Moderate (N5, N7) |
| AI exposure | Direct (GPUs) | Indirect (networking) |
| Cross-cluster corr | — | ~0.35 |

The clusters are **moderately separated** — connectivity names don't move in lockstep with NVDA/AMD rallies.
