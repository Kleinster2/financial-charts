# Defense

Global defense and aerospace sector. Structural rearmament underway across US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

---

## Global rearmament

Defense spending entering structural upcycle driven by:
- Great power competition (US-China, Russia-NATO)
- Ukraine war depleting stockpiles
- Taiwan contingency planning
- Middle East instability

### Spending trajectory

| Metric | 2024 | 2040 (S&P est) |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Global defense spending | ~$2.5T | **$6T** |
| Growth | — | +140% |

> "Every advanced weapon system depends on the metal." — S&P Global (on copper/materials constraints)

## Regional breakdown

### United States

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 budget | ~$895B |
| FY27 proposed | **$1.5T** (+68%) |
| Focus | AI, space, modernization |

See [[Trump defense budget]] for Jan 2026 executive order on capital returns.

### Europe

| Country | 2024 spend | NATO target |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Germany | ~$80B | 2%+ GDP |
| UK | ~$75B | 2.5% target |
| France | ~$60B | Growing |
| Poland | ~$35B | 4%+ GDP (leader) |

See [[European defense spending]]. EU targeting 3M artillery shells/year by end of decade.

### Asia-Pacific

| Country | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Japan | Record budgets, constitutional shift |
| South Korea | Domestic industry growth |
| Australia | AUKUS submarine program |
| Taiwan | Asymmetric defense buildup |
| India | Modernization, domestic production |

China defense spending officially ~$230B but likely understated.

## Munitions & supply chain

### Artillery production ramp

Stockpiles depleted by Ukraine war. Massive production expansion underway.

| Region | Pre-war | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| US | 93K shells/yr | 1.2M shells/yr | 2025 |
| EU | 230K shells/yr | 3M shells/yr | End of decade |

US investing **$5B** in munitions factory upgrades.

### Copper in weapons

Copper is **second-highest material by weight** in US defense production.

| Application | Copper use |
|-------------|------------|
| 155mm artillery shell | 0.5 kg each |
| Driving bands | Shell rotation/rifling |
| Shaped-charge liners | Anti-tank munitions |
| Bullet jackets | Small arms rounds |
| Missile guidance | Electronics, wiring |

See [[Copper]] for supply constraints — 17-year mine timeline vs. surging defense demand.

### Critical materials

| Material | Defense use | Supply risk |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Copper | Munitions, electronics | China 40% smelting |
| Rare earths | Guidance, motors | China 60%+ processing |
| Titanium | Airframes, armor | Russia supply disrupted |
| Tungsten | Armor-piercing rounds | China dominant |
