# Defense

Global defense and aerospace sector. Structural rearmament underway across US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

---

## Global rearmament

Defense spending entering structural upcycle driven by:
- Great power competition (US-China, Russia-NATO)
- Ukraine war depleting stockpiles
- Taiwan contingency planning
- Middle East instability

### Spending trajectory

| Metric | 2025 | 2027E | 2040 (S&P est) |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| Global defense spending | **>$2.5T** | **>$3T** | **$6T** |
| Growth | — | Double-digit | +140% vs 2024 |

Sector +55% past year (Jan 2026). Global X expects double-digit spending growth for "foreseeable future."

> "Every advanced weapon system depends on the metal." — S&P Global (on copper/materials constraints)

## Regional breakdown

### United States

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 budget | ~$895B |
| FY27 proposed | **$1.5T** (+68%) |
| Focus | AI, space, modernization |

See [[Trump defense budget]] for Jan 2026 executive order on capital returns.

### Europe

| Country | 2024 spend | NATO target |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Germany | ~$80B | 2%+ GDP |
| UK | ~$75B | 2.5% target |
| France | ~$60B | Growing |
| Poland | ~$35B | 4%+ GDP (leader) |

See [[European defense spending]]. EU targeting 3M artillery shells/year by end of decade.

### Asia-Pacific

| Country | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Japan | Record budgets, constitutional shift |
| South Korea | Domestic industry growth |
| Australia | AUKUS submarine program |
| Taiwan | Asymmetric defense buildup |
| India | Modernization, domestic production |

China defense spending officially ~$230B but likely understated.

## Prime contractors

| Company | Market cap | Specialization |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Lockheed Martin | ~$140B | F-35, missiles, space |
| RTX (Raytheon) | ~$160B | Missiles, engines, avionics |
| [[Northrop Grumman]] | ~$80B | B-21 bomber, space, cyber |
| Boeing Defense | (part of BA) | Aircraft, satellites |

---

## Drone pure-plays

| Company | Market cap | Focus |
|---------|------------|-------|
| [[AeroVironment]] | ~$9B | Small UAS, loitering munitions (Switchblade) |
| [[Kratos]] | ~$8B | Attritable drones (Valkyrie), hypersonic targets |

Drone business "red hot" (William Blair, Jan 2026). Backlogs surging on [[Golden Dome]], Ukraine lessons, and global rearmament. Both trading at 90-106x forward earnings.

See [[Drone warfare]] for full landscape: cost asymmetry, Ukraine lessons, demand drivers, counter-drone problem.

## IT services contractors

See [[Defense IT Services]] for full sector coverage.

| Company | Revenue | Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|
| [[Leidos]] | ~$16B | ISR, cyber, logistics |
| [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] | $12B | AI, analytics, consulting |
| [[General Dynamics IT]] | ~$10B | Cloud, managed services |
| [[SAIC]] | ~$8B | IT modernization |
| [[CACI]] | $8.6B | C5ISR, space |
| [[ManTech]] | ~$2.6B | Cyber, data/AI |

**Theme:** Labor-intensive, cost-plus contracts, clearance moats.

## Sector characteristics

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Long cycles** | 5-10+ year programs |
| **Cost-plus contracts** | Margin stability |
| **Classified programs** | Limited visibility |
| **Bipartisan support** | Budget resilience |
| **Workforce constraints** | Skilled labor shortage |

---

## Sector KPIs

| Metric | Definition | Good / Target | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Book-to-Bill** | Orders / Revenue | **>1.0x** | Backlog growth signal (>1 means growing) |
| **Backlog Coverage** | Backlog / Annual Revenue | **>1.5-2.0x** | Revenue visibility (safety net) |
| **Operating Margin** | Op Income / Revenue | **10-12%** | Profitability (capped by gov't contracts) |
| **FMS Mix** | Foreign Military Sales % | **Growing** | Higher margins than domestic US sales |
| **FCF Conversion** | Free Cash Flow / Net Income | **>100%** | Quality of earnings & buyback fuel |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Budget politics | Sequestration risk |
| Program delays/cancellations | Revenue volatility |
| Fixed-price contracts | Margin pressure |
| Supply chain | Component shortages |
| Competition from new entrants | Primes disrupted |

---

## Valuation

| Segment | P/E (Jan 2026) | Historical |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Large US primes | **24x** | 16x (Jan 2025) |
| Drone pure-plays (AVAV, KTOS) | **90-106x** | — |
| AI defense (Palantir) | 100x+ | — |

Sector re-rated sharply in 2025 on rearmament thesis. Primes now trading well above historical 15-20x range. Expected EPS growth **+15%** in 2026 (vs 6% historical avg) partially justifies expansion. Drone stocks priced beyond even AI multiples.
