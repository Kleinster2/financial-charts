## Current themes (2025-2026)

### PBM reform and antitrust scrutiny

See [[Drug Distribution]] for full detail. The Big Three PBMs — OptumRx ([[UnitedHealth]]), CVS Caremark ([[CVS Health]]), Express Scripts ([[Cigna]]) — control ~80% of the prescription drug market. Facing spread pricing bans (effective Jan 2026), congressional reform (2026 Appropriations Act), and state-level legislation. Employer defection accelerating: 61% contracted with Big Three in 2025, down from 72% in 2024.

### UnitedHealthcare CEO assassination aftermath

Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot and killed outside the New York Hilton on December 4, 2024. The killing triggered a national conversation about insurance practices:

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Thompson killed | Dec 4, 2024 |
| Luigi Mangione arrested | Dec 9, 2024 |
| Terrorism charges dismissed | Sep 2025 |
| Federal death penalty sought | 2025 (AG Pam Bondi) |

**Industry fallout:**
- Insurers pledged to reduce prior authorization scope by 2026
- [[UnitedHealth]] committed to 100% rebate pass-through at PBM
- CEO Andrew Witty resigned May 2025; Stephen Hemsley returned
- DOJ criminal investigation ongoing
- Stock down ~50% from pre-assassination levels

### Medicare Advantage rate shock

See [[Medicare Advantage]] for full detail. CMS proposed **flat 0.09%** rate increase for 2027 vs 5.06% for 2026. Chart review rule change targets risk adjustment gaming. $80B sector selloff on Jan 27, 2026 — largest single-day wipeout in managed care history.

| Exposure | Company |
|----------|---------|
| Highest | [[Humana]] (85% of revenue) |
| Moderate | [[UnitedHealth]], [[CVS Health]] |
| Lowest | [[Cigna]] (sold Medicare business 2024) |

### Vertical integration under attack

See [[Drug Distribution]] for detail. The integrated insurer-PBM model ([[UnitedHealth]]-Optum, [[CVS Health]]-Aetna-Caremark, [[Cigna]]-Express Scripts) faces antitrust pressure, congressional scrutiny, and employer pushback. [[Claritev]] lawsuit is the precedent. [[Cigna]] positioned as relative winner — sold Medicare exposure, less vertically integrated.

### GLP-1 / Obesity drugs

| Company | Drug | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| **[[Novo Nordisk]]** | Ozempic, Wegovy | Market leader |
| **[[Eli Lilly]]** | Mounjaro, Zepbound | Fast follower |
| [[Amgen]] | MariTide | Phase 2 |
| [[Pfizer]] | Danuglipron | Struggling |

**TAM:** $100B+ obesity market by 2030.

**Ripple effects:**
- Negative: Bariatric surgery, diabetes devices, junk food
- Positive: Drug manufacturers, injection devices

### Patent cliffs

| Company | Drug | Patent expiry | Revenue at risk |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| [[Merck]] | Keytruda | 2028 | ~$25B |
| [[AbbVie]] | Humira | 2023 (lost) | Biosimilar competition |
| [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] | Opdivo | 2028 | ~$10B |

### AI in drug discovery

See [[AI drug discovery]] for detail.

| Company | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| [[Recursion]] | AI-driven drug discovery |
| [[Insilico Medicine]] | Generative AI for molecules |
| Isomorphic Labs ([[Google]]) | AlphaFold applications |
| Big Pharma | Internal AI teams |

---

## Business models

| Model | Margin profile | Risk |
|-------|----------------|------|
| Big Pharma | High (70%+ gross) | Patent cliffs |
| Biotech | Variable | Binary outcomes |
| Medtech | Medium (60-70%) | Procedure volumes |
| Insurers | Low (MLR ~85%) | Medical costs, regulation |
| Distributors/PBMs | Very low (~3%) | See [[Drug Distribution]] |

---

## Regulatory environment

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| **FDA** | Drug/device approval |
| **CMS** | Medicare pricing, coverage, MA rates |
| **FTC** | M&A review, PBM scrutiny |
| **DOJ** | Antitrust enforcement |

**Key policies:**
- **IRA drug pricing:** Medicare negotiation for top drugs starting 2026
- **PBM reform:** See [[Drug Distribution]] for spread pricing ban, 2026 Appropriations Act
- **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025):** Regulatory complexity across pharmacies, PBMs

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| GLP-1 dominance | [[Novo Nordisk]], [[Eli Lilly]] |
| Biotech M&A | Large-cap pharma acquiring |
| [[AI drug discovery]] | [[Recursion]], partnerships |
| [[Medicare Advantage]] pressure | Avoid [[Humana]] concentration |
| PBM reform losers | [[UnitedHealth]], [[CVS Health]] exposure |
| PBM reform relative winner | [[Cigna]] (sold Medicare 2024) |
| Patent cliff losers | Avoid concentrated exposure |

---

## Key risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **PBM antitrust outcomes** | Structural margin compression |
| **Medicare Advantage rates** | Multi-year headwind, not one-time |
| **Drug pricing regulation** | Margin compression |
| **Patent expiry** | Revenue cliffs |
| **Clinical trial failures** | Biotech binary risk |
| **Political scrutiny** | Post-Thompson, ongoing |
