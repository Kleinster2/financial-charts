# Crypto-to-AI

Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI/HPC hosting. Trades as a distinct cluster (0.61 correlation), separate from traditional DC REITs.

*HUT and IREN most correlated (0.70). All four moving together on AI infrastructure theme, but high volatility.*

## Correlation structure

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Avg correlation** | **0.61** | Strong (tight cluster) |
| Range | 0.53 - 0.70 | CORZ-IREN to HUT-IREN |
| vs [[DC REITs]] | 0.08-0.20 | Separate clusters |
| Period | 2024-01 to present | |

**Pairwise detail:**
| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| HUT - IREN | **0.70** |
| HUT - WULF | 0.68 |
| IREN - WULF | 0.66 |
| CORZ - WULF | 0.57 |
| CORZ - HUT | 0.55 |
| CORZ - IREN | 0.53 |

CORZ slightly less correlated — further along in AI pivot (CoreWeave deal).

## Key actors

| Company | Ticker | AI Strategy | Key Deal |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| [[Core Scientific]] | CORZ | GPU hosting | $3.5B CoreWeave partnership |
| [[Hut 8]] | HUT | Hybrid BTC + AI | Building AI infrastructure |
| [[IREN]] | IREN | Expanding AI capacity | Data center buildout |
| [[TeraWulf]] | WULF | AI hosting | Zero-carbon focus |

## Why this cluster exists

**Shared characteristics:**
- Former/current Bitcoin miners
- Existing power infrastructure (stranded/cheap energy)
- Pivoting to AI/HPC hosting for higher margins
- High beta, speculative investor base
- Similar risk profile (execution, capital needs)

**Why separate from DC REITs:**
- EQIX-CORZ correlation: 0.10 (near zero)
- Different business model (operate GPUs vs lease space)
- Different customer (AI startups vs enterprise)
- Different investor base (growth/spec vs REIT funds)

## Business model comparison

| Factor | Crypto-to-AI | DC REITs |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Revenue | GPU/hosting fees | Lease income |
| Volatility | High (crypto + AI cycles) | Low (long-term leases) |
| Margins | Variable | 60-70% gross |
| Capital intensity | Very high | High |
| Customer concentration | Often high | Diversified |

---

## Investment angle

**Bull case:**
- Existing power infrastructure is scarce asset
- AI demand exceeds hyperscaler capacity
- Higher margins than Bitcoin mining
- First-mover advantage in AI hosting

**Bear case:**
- Execution risk on pivot
- GPU depreciation
- Customer concentration
- Competition from well-capitalized REITs
- Still tied to crypto sentiment
