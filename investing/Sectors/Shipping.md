Global maritime shipping: container lines, ports, and port equipment.

---

## Container lines

| Company | Market share | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| [[MSC]] | ~19% | Private, Swiss-Italian |
| [[Maersk]] | ~16% | Danish, publicly traded |
| [[COSCO]] | ~12% | Chinese state-owned |
| [[CMA CGM]] | ~12% | French, private |

**Dynamics:**
- Extreme cyclicality (2021-22 boom → bust)
- Alliance structures (2M, Ocean Alliance, THE Alliance)
- Red Sea disruption (2024) rerouted traffic
- Overcapacity concerns

## Ports

| Operator | Key asset | Throughput |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| [[SIPG]] | [[Yangshan Deep Water Port]] | 50M+ TEU (world \#1) |
| [[PSA Singapore]] | Singapore terminals | 39M TEU |
| [[Hutchison Ports]] | Global network | 83M TEU total |
| [[DP World]] | Jebel Ali, global | 90M+ TEU total |

**Dynamics:**
- [[Port automation]] driving efficiency gains (+50% with dual-trolley cranes)
- China controls 9 of 10 busiest ports globally
- Cybersecurity concerns over China-made equipment at Western ports

## Port equipment

| Supplier | Share | Products |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [[ZPMC]] | ~80% STS cranes | Automated cranes, AGVs, terminal systems |
| Liebherr | ~10% | Mobile harbor cranes |
| Kalmar | Niche | RTGs, reach stackers |
| Konecranes | Niche | RTGs, lift trucks |

**ZPMC dominance:** 80% of US port cranes are ZPMC. Congressional investigation (2024) flagged remote-control capabilities as security risk.

## Key concepts

- [[Port automation]] — automation tech and investment implications
- [[Supply chain bottlenecks]] — ports as chokepoint
- [[Northern Sea Route]] — Arctic alternative to Suez (Polar Silk Road)
- [[Northwest Passage]] — Canadian Arctic route (not yet viable)

## Investment themes

| Theme | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| China port dominance | [[SIPG]] (600018.SS) |
| Equipment monopoly | [[ZPMC]] (600320.SS) |
| Western alternatives | Liebherr, Konecranes (long-dated) |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Trade war / tariffs** | Volume decline |
| **Overcapacity** | Container rate collapse |
| **Cybersecurity regulation** | ZPMC revenue at risk |
| **Red Sea / Suez** | Rerouting costs; Horn of Africa escalation risk (see below) |

## Horn of Africa Escalation Risk (February 2026)

Beyond the ongoing Houthi shipping disruption, the Horn of Africa faces potential **state-on-state conflict** between Ethiopia and Eritrea centered on the port of Assab — directly at the Bab el-Mandeb strait. ICG (February 18, 2026) warned conflict "could erupt at any time." An Ethiopia-Eritrea war would layer a conventional military conflict onto the existing Houthi disruption at the same chokepoint.

**Market impact if conflict erupts:**
- Further reduction in Red Sea/Suez transit volumes (already down ~75% from Houthi attacks as of mid-2025)
- Extended Cape of Good Hope rerouting (adds ~10-14 days and fuel costs)
- Bullish for container rates (capacity absorbed by longer routes)
- [[DP World]]'s Berbera (Somaliland) concession directly exposed
- Egypt's Suez revenue at further risk — compounds existing economic pressure
