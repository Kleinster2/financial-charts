# Cement

After water, the most consumed substance on Earth — 25-30 billion metric tons of concrete poured annually (3x all coal mined). Critical for understanding construction-driven economies and climate transition.

## Why cement is different

**Unlike oil, copper, or plastics, cement consumption doesn't plateau at high-income levels — it collapses.**

![[china-cement-comparison.png]]
*[[China]] · [[Japan]] · [[India]]*

| Country | GDP/capita | Cement/capita | Stage |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| China | $27,105 | 1.35 tons | Peak/decline |
| Saudi Arabia | $71,735 | 1.42 tons | Building out |
| Vietnam | $16,386 | 1.09 tons | Urbanizing |
| South Korea | $58,895 | 1.01 tons | Mature |
| Japan | $51,685 | 0.37 tons | Post-peak |
| US | $85,810 | 0.25 tons | Post-peak |
| UK | — | ~0.25 tons | Post-peak |
| Burkina Faso | — | ~0.25 tons | Pre-urbanization |

**The pattern:** Consumption surges during urbanization/industrialization (building cities, infrastructure), then crashes once the stock is built. UK and Burkina Faso use the same per-capita cement despite 30x income difference.

**Investment implication:** Cement is a one-time buildout, not ongoing consumption. Secular growth stories eventually become secular decline stories.

## Industry structure

**Characteristics:**
- Highly regional (cement expensive to ship relative to value)
- Capital-intensive (kilns, quarries)
- Consolidation ongoing (scale economies)
- Pricing power varies by market concentration

### Major players

| Company | HQ | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| **Holcim** | Switzerland | Largest globally, spun from LafargeHolcim |
| **HeidelbergCement** | Germany | #2 globally |
| **Cemex** | Mexico | LatAm leader |
| **Anhui Conch** | China | Largest Chinese producer |
| **China National Building Material** | China | State-owned consolidator |
| **UltraTech Cement** | India | Aditya Birla Group, India leader |
| **Dalmia Bharat** | India | Growing Indian player |

## Geographic demand

### China (declining)

![[china-cement-vs-building-starts.png]]
*[[China]]*
*Building starts at 2003 levels; cement output still 2x higher — more decline ahead.*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Share of global output | ~50% |
| 2021 peak | 4.4B tons (global) |
| Decline since 2020 | **-30%** |
| 2026 outlook | 6th consecutive year of decline |
| Capacity utilization | ~50% (2x needed capacity) |
| Prices | Decade lows |

**Projection:** At 4%/year decline, China produces 350M fewer tons by 2030.

See [[China]] for full macro context (property -17.2%, FAI -3.8%).

### India (growing)

- Expected +40-50M tons over coming years
- Infrastructure buildout (roads, housing, smart cities)
- Cannot replace China shortfall (350M tons)
- UltraTech, Dalmia Bharat primary beneficiaries

### Other growth markets

| Region | Outlook |
|--------|---------|
| Vietnam | +5-10M tons |
| Indonesia | +5-10M tons |
| Egypt | +5-10M tons |
| Turkey | +5-10M tons |
| Africa | Urbanization tailwind, but from low base |

**Net:** Global ex-China growth doesn't offset China decline. Global cement production likely peaked in 2021.

## Climate challenge

**Cement = ~8% of global CO2 emissions**

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Chemical process | ~60% (limestone calcination releases CO2) |
| Kiln fuel | ~40% (heating to 1,450°C) |

**Emissions intensity:** ~0.8 tons CO2 per ton cement

### Decarbonization approaches

| Approach | Potential | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Volcanic ash / pozzolans | 5-10% reduction | Commercial |
| Steel slag / fly ash | 5-10% reduction | Commercial |
| Alternative fuels | Marginal | Commercial |
| Carbon capture (CCS) | 90%+ potential | Barely piloted |
| Novel cements | Uncertain | R&D stage |

**Reality check:** Technological fixes only achieve 5-10% cuts. CCS is the only path to deep decarbonization but almost never deployed at scale. Countries most likely to adopt (rich nations) already have declining consumption.

**Structural decline may be the primary decarbonization mechanism** — demand destruction doing what technology can't.

## Investment angles

### Bearish (structural decline)

- China demand destruction irreversible
- Global peak likely passed (2021)
- Overcapacity = margin pressure
- Climate regulation risk (carbon pricing)
- Short China-exposed producers (Anhui Conch, CNBM)

### Bullish (regional growth)

- India infrastructure buildout (UltraTech, Dalmia Bharat)
- Africa urbanization (long-dated)
- US infrastructure bill tailwinds (regional players)
- Consolidation = survivors gain pricing power

### Thematic

- Long CCS/decarbonization plays if cement must decarbonize
- Pair trade: short China cement / long India cement
