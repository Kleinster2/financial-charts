**Hotel industry** — Global lodging sector. Highly cyclical, sensitive to travel demand, macro conditions, and [[Real estate cycles]]. Asset-light franchise models dominate public markets.

---

## Key metrics

| **RevPAR** | Revenue per available room (occupancy × ADR) | ~$101 |
| **ADR** | Average daily rate | ~$160 |
| **Occupancy** | % of rooms sold | ~63% |

RevPAR is the industry's core KPI — combines pricing power and demand in one number.

1. **Canadian inbound collapse** — down 23.7% YTD (tariff tensions)

4. **Supply growth** — 5%+ net rooms in some markets

---

## Tailwinds (2026+)

1. **FIFA World Cup 2026** (US) — major inbound travel catalyst
2. **Supply moderation** — deliveries falling 30-40% YoY in 2025-2026
3. **International travel recovery** — excluding Canada
4. **Business travel normalization**

## Business models

| Model | Description | Players |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Asset-light (franchise)** | Fees from franchisees; don't own hotels | [[Marriott]], [[Hilton]], [[Wyndham]] |
| **Asset-heavy** | Own/operate properties | REITs, private equity |
| **Mixed** | Some owned, mostly franchised | [[Hyatt]], [[IHG]] |

Asset-light companies trade at premium multiples (higher ROIC, less capital intensity).

---

## Major players

| Company | Ticker | Rooms | Model |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| [[Marriott]] | MAR | 1.75M+ | Asset-light |
| [[Hilton]] | HLT | 1.25M+ | Asset-light |
| [[IHG]] | IHG | 950K+ | Mixed |
| [[Wyndham]] | WH | 850K+ | Asset-light |
| [[Hyatt]] | H | 330K+ | Mixed |

## Segments

| Segment | Example brands | Target |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Luxury** | Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, W | High-end leisure/business |
| **Upper-upscale** | Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton | Business travelers |

| **Economy** | Motel 6, Super 8 | Price-sensitive |

## Extended stay segment

Lower operating costs (less housekeeping), stickier guests, higher margins. Key players:

- Extended Stay America (private, formerly [[Blackstone]]/[[Lightstone Group]])
- Residence Inn ([[Marriott]])
- Homewood Suites ([[Hilton]])

[[Lightstone Group]]'s 2007 $8B Extended Stay acquisition from [[Blackstone]] ended in bankruptcy (2009) — case study in leverage risk.

---

## Moxy Hotels case study

[[Marriott]]'s millennial-focused brand. [[Lightstone Group]] is exclusive developer in gateway cities (NYC, LA, Miami).

**Concept:** European-style micro-rooms, playful design, social lobbies. Budget price point (~$150-250/night) without sacrificing style.

**Results:** 8 properties, multiple Conde Nast awards. Shows how focused development partnerships can create brand differentiation.

---

## Insights

- **Luxury vs economy bifurcation** — high-end travelers resilient; economy segment suffers in inflation/uncertainty
- **Asset-light wins** — [[Hilton]] +175% vs [[Marriott]] +115% since 2020 (both asset-light, but Hilton more pure)
- **RevPAR is the metric** — combines occupancy and pricing; guides all forecasting
- **Supply cycles matter** — 2025-2027 deliveries falling, creating 2027-2028 opportunity

## Correlation structure

Asset-light hotel operators form a distinct tradeable cluster. Analysis (2022-present):

| Cluster | Avg Correlation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Asset-light (MAR, HLT, H, WH, IHG) | **0.62** |
| vs Hotel REITs (HST, PK, RHP) | 0.51 |
| vs OTAs (BKNG, EXPE, ABNB) | 0.55 |
| vs Airlines (DAL, UAL, LUV) | 0.51 |
| vs Office/Retail REITs (SPG, VNO) | **0.38** |

**Key finding:** Hotels correlate poorly with traditional REITs (0.38) but strongly within the lodging vertical. MAR and HLT specifically correlate 0.72-0.74 with HST (hotel REIT), versus 0.38 with SPG/VNO.

**Implication:** Hotels are consumer-discretionary, not real estate. Standalone sector, linked to [[Travel]] but not subordinate to [[Real estate]].
