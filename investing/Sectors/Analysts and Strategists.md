# Analysts and Strategists

The vault's analyst bench — the voices that shape narratives, move markets, or provide frameworks worth tracking. Organized by what they cover, not where they sit.

## How to use this hub

- Before writing a thesis — check who's already said it (and whether they were right)
- Contrarian signal — when consensus analysts agree, check the structural thinkers (Pozsar, Napier, Gromen)
- Track record matters — each note documents hits AND misses
- Sell-side vs independent — sell-side has data access; independents have freedom. Both have biases.

## Notable patterns

- Analysts who joined companies they covered: [[Toshiya Hari]] (Goldman → NVIDIA)
- Bears who stayed too long: [[Mike Wilson]] (2023), [[David Rosenberg]] (2010s), [[Marko Kolanovic]] (2023-24)
- Framework builders: [[Aswath Damodaran]], [[Michael Mauboussin]], [[Russell Napier]], [[Ben Thompson]]
- Narrative movers: [[Cathie Wood]], [[Tom Lee]], [[Dan Ives]] — their calls move retail flows

## Gaps to fill

- Credit analysts (Meredith Whitney era is over — who's next?)
- China/EM specialists
- Energy sector (Amrita Sen / Energy Aspects, Anas Alhajji)
- Real estate / housing (Ivy Zelman)
- Quant researchers (Marcos López de Prado, Andrew Lo)
