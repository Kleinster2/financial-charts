## Insights

- **Banks dominate but pulling back** — Regional banks reducing CRE exposure after 2023 stress; creates opportunity for debt funds and life insurers.
- **Office is the problem child** — 20%+ vacancy, remote work structural shift, $1T+ loans maturing into higher rates. Defaults rising.
- **Multifamily is the safe haven** — GSE-eligible (Fannie/Freddie programs), best liquidity, still positive fundamentals despite rate pressure.

## Current stress (2025)

| Issue | Scale | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Office distress** | 20%+ vacancy | Defaults, write-downs |
| **Maturing loans** | $1T+ in 2024-2025 | Refi into higher rates |
| **Bank pullback** | Regional banks | Less credit availability |
| **CMBS spreads** | +200bps vs 2021 | Higher borrowing costs |
| **Cap rate expansion** | +100-200bps | Lower property values |

**Office maturity wall:** Loans originated 2019-2021 at low rates and high valuations now maturing into:
- Higher rates (5-7% vs 3-4%)
- Lower valuations (cap rate expansion)
- Lower NOI (vacancy)

Result: Many loans underwater, unable to refinance.
