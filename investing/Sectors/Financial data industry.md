| **Enterprise data licensing** | Refinitiv Elektron | Growing faster than terminals |

| **Ratings** | S&P, Moody's | 62% op margin (oligopoly) |

## Competitive dynamics

**Bloomberg's moats:**
1. **Network effects** — Bloomberg Message is how Wall Street talks. Can't leave if counterparties are on Bloomberg.
2. **Switching costs** — Decades of muscle memory, workflows, keyboard shortcuts
3. **Bundling** — Data + analytics + news + chat + trading in one terminal
4. **Data breadth** — 35M+ instruments

**Why competitors struggle:**
- Refinitiv/Eikon: Cheaper but no chat network effect. Lost $900M revenue over decade.
- FactSet: Strong in buy-side research but no trading workflow
- Capital IQ: Corporate finance niche, not trading

**The chat moat is real:** Bloomberg Message handles millions of messages daily between traders, salespeople, and clients. This social network — not just the data — creates lock-in.

## Recent consolidation

| Year | Deal | Value | Rationale |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 2018 | Blackstone carves out Refinitiv | $17B | Thomson Reuters exit |
| 2021 | LSEG acquires Refinitiv | $27B | Exchange + data integration |
| 2022 | S&P + IHS Markit | $44B | Data diversification |
| 2022 | FactSet acquires CUSIP | $1.9B | Identifiers monopoly |

## Investment implications

**Bull case:**
- Sticky, recurring revenue

- Data becoming more critical (quant, AI)
- Consolidation = fewer competitors

**Bear case:**
- Bloomberg's dominance hard to crack
- Refinitiv losing share despite lower prices
- AI could commoditize basic data
- FactSet stock down 40% from highs
