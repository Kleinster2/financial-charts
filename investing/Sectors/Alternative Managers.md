## BLK is an outlier

| Stock | Correlation with PE | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| BLK (BlackRock) | 0.60-0.70 | Traditional asset manager |

BLK is the largest asset manager globally but focuses on passive/ETFs, not alternatives. It trades with the market (0.70+ with SPY) more than PE names.

## Business model

| Factor | Alt Managers |
|--------|--------------|
| Revenue | Management fees (1-2%) + performance fees (20%) |
| AUM growth | Key driver of earnings |
| Fundraising | 2-3 year cycles |
| Carry | Realized on exits |

Rising rates headwind for leveraged buyouts but tailwind for credit funds.
