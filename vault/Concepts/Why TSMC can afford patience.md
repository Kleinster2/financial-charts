[[TSMC]]'s "disciplined" capital allocation is enabled by dominance, not the cause of it.

## The positional advantage

- With ~60% market share, TSMC faces no urgency to take unnecessary risks
- No credible challenger at leading edge means patience has no cost
- Monopolists can wait; challengers cannot

## Why others can't copy this

- [[Samsung]]'s aggression is partly *forced* by being #2
- "Disciplined" execution from #2 position = permanent irrelevance
- [[Intel Foundry Services]] faces similar pressure

## The benchmark fallacy

Comparing Samsung unfavorably to TSMC's discipline ignores asymmetry:
- The same strategy would fail from Samsung's position
- TSMC is playing defense; challengers must play offense
