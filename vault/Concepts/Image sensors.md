Image sensors (CMOS) for smartphones — adjacent semiconductor segment where [[Samsung]] has technology leadership.

---

## Why it's relevant

- Shows Samsung isn't just "struggling foundry" — they lead in some areas
- [[TSMC]] also competes here
- Metamaterial tech could have broader applications (AR, lithography)

---

## Current state (Dec 2025)

**Megapixel arms race:**
- Current: 0.5μm pixels, 200MP sensors
- Coming: 0.35μm pixels, potentially 800MP

**The physics problem:**
- 0.35μm is smaller than wavelength of visible light
- Diffraction limits resolution and autofocus

**Samsung's solution:**
- Metaphotonic Color Router (NanoPrism)
- Metamaterial lenses using Titanium Dioxide nano-posts
- First mass-market implementation of metamaterial optics

---

## Broader implications

Metamaterial lenses could enable:
- AR glasses displays
- Silicon photonics beam steering
- Advanced lithography systems

---

## Competitive position

| Company | Position |
|---------|----------|
| [[Samsung]] | Leader — NanoPrism metamaterial tech |
| Sony | Strong — dominant in high-end |
| [[TSMC]] | Competing — 0.43μm quad-photodiode at IEDM |
| OmniVision | Budget segment |

---

## For Samsung narrative

Samsung's conglomerate has pockets of excellence:
- Image sensors: leading
- Memory: strong
- Foundry: struggling

Not a broken company — uneven execution across segments.
