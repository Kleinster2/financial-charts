Severe DRAM/NAND shortage driving prices up — and availability may become the bigger issue.

---

## The situation

- Spot and contract prices rising for multiple quarters
- Price increases "far from over"
- Risk: memory becomes **unavailable**, not just expensive
- Affects: computers, servers, mobile devices, all systems

---

## Three drivers

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Limited capacity additions** | No major new fabs coming online into 2026 |
| **HBM wafer allocation** | DRAM wafers converted to HBM → squeezes commodity DRAM |
| **Cleanroom constraints** | Big 3 can't expand fast enough |

Plus: [[Export controls]] prevent China fabs from expanding.

## Wafer conversion dynamics

```
DRAM wafers → HBM (for AI)
NAND wafers → DRAM (to backfill)
```

AI demand for HBM is cannibalizing commodity memory supply. Structural, not cyclical.

---

## Who benefits

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| [[SK Hynix]] | HBM leader + DRAM pricing power |
| [[Samsung]] | Memory margins improve |
| [[Micron]] | Same dynamics |

Memory profits fund other bets (foundry, packaging).

---

## Who loses

| Player | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Consumer electronics OEMs | Higher BoM costs |
| PC/smartphone makers | Price increases or spec downgrades |
| End consumers | Pay more, get less |

---

## Partial offset

Weak consumer electronics demand could ease shortage — but only partially. AI/server demand remains strong.

---

## Timeline

- Q3-Q4 2025: Sharp price increases
- 2026: Shortage continues, pace may moderate
- Structural squeeze persists until new capacity comes online

---

## Micron confirmation (Dec 2025)

From Q1 FY26 earnings:

> "Largest ever seen supply-demand gap"
> "Only meeting 50-67% of demand from key customers"
> "Tightness to persist through and beyond CY2026"

**Hard numbers:**
- DRAM ASP +20% q/q
- CY26 HBM fully contracted (price AND volume)
- CY26 industry bit shipment growth ~20% (supply constrained)
- GM expanding: 56.8% → 68% guided
- HBM TAM: $35B (2025) → $100B (2028)

This is as strong a confirmation as you'll get — direct from management.

## For [[Short TSMC long Korea]] thesis

**Bullish Korea:**
- Memory shortage = pricing power
- SK Hynix and Samsung margins expand
- Profits fund foundry/packaging expansion
- [[Export controls]] add to supply constraint

This compounds with the VEU revocation news — Korea memory in strong position.
