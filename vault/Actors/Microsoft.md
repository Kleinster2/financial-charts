---

## Relevance to semis

Microsoft is the largest AI infrastructure spender. OpenAI partnership makes them critical demand driver for NVIDIA GPUs.

---

## Chip strategy

- Massive [[NVIDIA]] buyer (OpenAI infrastructure)
- **Maia**: Custom AI accelerator (announced 2023)
- **Cobalt**: ARM-based CPU
- Designed in-house, fabbed at [[TSMC]]

---

## OpenAI relationship

Exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI. OpenAI's compute needs flow through Microsoft Azure, which flows to NVIDIA, which flows to TSMC.
