# Rapidus

Japanese national champion for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Targeting 2nm by 2027.

---

## Background

- **Founded**: 2022
- **Location**: Hokkaido, Japan
- **Backing**: Japanese government + consortium (Toyota, Sony, NTT, others)
- **Technology partner**: IBM (2nm GAA process)
- **Goal**: Restore Japan's semiconductor manufacturing capability

---

## Strategy: Small batch model

Unlike traditional high-volume fabs (TSMC, Samsung), Rapidus is pursuing a **small batch** approach:

- Faster processing times for baking, cooling steps
- Heavy reliance on metrology and inspection
- May start with small volumes in 2027
- Designed to push Japan's equipment ecosystem forward

This is a different bet — not competing on volume, but on flexibility and ecosystem development.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Pilot line | 2025 |
| Small volume production | 2027 |
| Mass production | TBD |

Supplier sentiment at SEMICON Japan 2024: "high confidence" in 2027 timeline.

## Why it matters for this vault

- Another 2nm entrant alongside [[TSMC]], [[Samsung]], [[Intel Foundry Services]]
- Different model (small batch) vs traditional high-volume
- Japan's "Lost 30 Years" potentially ending
- Could serve customers who want geographic diversification from Taiwan

---

## For theses

- [[Short TSMC long Korea]] — neutral to bearish Korea; competes with Samsung for "TSMC alternative" positioning
- [[Long TSMC]] — if Rapidus fails, reinforces TSMC's moat durability

---

## Open questions

- Can small batch model scale to meaningful volumes?
- Will customers trust a new entrant for 2nm?
- Is IBM 2nm process competitive with TSMC/Samsung GAA?
- How does Japanese government support compare to [[CHIPS Act]]?
